The Office for National Statistics works in partnership with others in the Government Statistical Service
to provide Parliament, government and the wider community with the statistical information, analysis and
advice needed to improve decision-making, stimulate research and inform debate. It also registers key life
events. It aims to provide an authoritative and impartial picture of society and a window on the work and
performance of government, allowing the impact of government policies and actions to be assessed.
Foreword
Britain 1999 is the 50th edition of an official
annual reference book that was first published
in the 1940s. Since 1997, it has been produced
by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Drawing on a wide range of official and other
authoritative sources, Britain 1999 provides a
factual and up-to-date overview of the state of
the United Kingdom, while also covering
government policy in every sphere of activity.
It is a widely used work of reference, both in
the UK itself, and overseas, where it is an
important element of the information service
provided by British diplomatic posts.
New Features
After 50 years, we have decided to change the
book’s title. Instead of being simply An Official
Handbook, it is now The Official Yearbook of the
United Kingdom. This more accurately reflects
its new location at the ONS, which is the richest
source of official facts and figures in the UK.
The 50th edition has more charts and tables
than ever before, and more colour pages. The
text is 280,000 words long and has been fully
updated and revised. The separate chapter on
Sustainable Development has been reinstated
and expanded, since this issue is perhaps the
most urgent facing the whole world, not just
Britain. An introductory essay by the editor, as
well as considering some of the enormous
changes that British society has undergone in
the past 50 years or so, attempts to show how
official statistics, far from being dry and remote,
translate back directly into personal experience.
Finally, the chapters, while covering the
same ground as usual, have been switched
around to match the order in other ONS
publications. In particular, the five Parts of
Britain 1999 now align with their equivalents in
the Annual Asbtract of Statistics, so that the two
books can be consulted as complementary
volumes, painting a picture of the UK in words
and figures.
Coverage
Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in Britain 1999 is accurate at
the time of going to press. The text is generally
based on information available up to September
1998. As far as possible, the book applies to the
UK as a whole, as the title suggests. However,
sometimes the information given refers to just:
• Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland;
• England and Wales, which are grouped
together for many administrative and
other purposes; or, in some instances,
• England alone.
Acknowledgements
Britain 1999 has been compiled with the full
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments and
agencies. The editor would like to thank all the
people from these organisations who have taken
so much time and care to ensure that the book’s
high standards of accuracy have been
maintained. Their contributions and comments
have been extremely valuable.
The book was researched, written, edited
and proofread by an in-house team of four,
backed up by a pool of experienced freelances.
The in-house team comprised Nigel Pearce,
Christine Winfield, Paul Webb and Stephen
Peace; the main freelances were Henry Langley,
Richard German, John Collis, Oliver Metcalf,
Jole Cosgrove and Jane Howard. The cover was
designed by The Stationery Office, and the
photographic sections and most of the other
artwork by Ray Martin.

Fifty not out
Reflections on the 50th edition of
Britain, by the Editor.
The editor and his elder brother on the beach at Felpham, Sussex, in the late 1950s.
According to the British Tourist Authority’s British National Travel Survey, in 1960, 90% of long
holidays (four nights or more) taken by residents of Great Britain were still within Great Britain itself,
more often than not by the seaside—the ‘traditional British holiday’. By 1997, however, that proportion
had fallen to just 52%. Improved transport, rising incomes and the availability of‘package’ holidays
are among the reasons for the vast increase in British holidays taken abroad.
The first proper edition of Britain was published on 6 November 1946 by the Central Office of
Information, eight years before I was born. There had been a forerunner, produced by the wartime
Ministry of Information and ‘passed by the British Censor’ two years earlier, but this was called
Post-war Reconstruction in Britain: A Record of Progress, January 1941 to November 1944 and does
not count as part of the series. The title, however, is interesting, because it reveals the extent to
which detailed post-war planning was already under way when the Second World War still had
more than four years to run—though, of course, the planners could not have known that at the time.
As someone born in the mid-1950s, I find that my childhood memories now go back almost 40
years. This realisation can be a bit startling when talking to office colleagues in their twenties and
early thirties, whose frames of reference only partially overlap with mine, but it highlights the
importance of a long-established series, like Britain, which encapsulates the changing state of the
nation over a substantial period. The historical knowledge and insights to be gleaned from such a
rich resource help to orient present-day Britons adrift in the fast-flowing river of time.1 Likewise,
the interplay between official facts and figures and personal experience helps to paint a picture of
contemporary society as an extension of the past, and as a platform for future planning.
1 As do other long-running series of books published by the ONS, such as Social Trends and Regional Trends.
BRITAIN 1999
My wife’s childhood was more colourful than mine. While I was growing up in a stable
middle-income household in suburban Surrey, she and her sister were ‘latchkey children’ living
with a divorced, working mother as head of household, in two rooms sandwiched between a pub
and a pet shop in Battersea. Some benign heroin addicts lived across the road with a number of
geese. Battersea may have been ‘gentrified’ since then, but drug use, or misuse, has intensified in
all sectors of society.
In the 1960s and early 1970s, lone parents with dependent children were still comparatively
rare: just one in thirteen families in 1971, for example, compared with more than one in five
today. The stigma attached to divorced or separated women was also more oppressive, and my
mother-in-law survived several years of real social and economic hardship.

When, by a stroke of luck, her family moved upstream to new premises in
Star & Garter Mansions by the river at Putney, a curious reversal of the
elements was one of the first sights to greet their eyes. The Thames had
flooded and swans were paddling along the road, while an amphibious car was
driving down the centre of the river. The impression, however, was
misleading. Amphibious cars, like the ‘eight-track’ cartridge audio system or the old ‘Beta’ video
format, are a good example of that recurrent phenomenon of the consumer society: the gadget
that fails to gain access to the hearts and pockets of the buying public and sinks without trace.
Similarly, the swans were somewhat anomalous, because they were paddling in water that was far
from savoury.
Although the Thames had not suffered the major industrial pollution problems of such northern
English rivers as the Tyne and the Tees, by the late 1950s the output from London’s ageing
Victorian sewer system had starved it of oxygen. In 1957, there was no living fish population
between Kew in the west and Gravesend in the east. It was a dead river. In the 1960s the money
allocated to clean up sewerage discharges began to have an effect on river quality, and by the middle
of the decade fish were turning up in the intakes of London power stations.
As I walk to work today over Vauxhall Bridge and into the City of Westminster, with heavy
traffic thundering past me, diving cormorants bear witness to the new life in the river. There are
now 116 species of fish in the upper Thames estuary, over 350 species of invertebrate and many
important bird species. Herons and other waders are quite common, and a sculptor acquaintance of
mine has seen a kingfisher from his riverside studio, between Chelsea Bridge and Victoria Station.
viii
FIFTY NOT OUT
Back in 1974, the discovery of the first adult salmon in the river for 150 years led to the
establishment, five years later, of the Thames Salmon Rehabilitation Scheme. Fish passes have
since been built on almost all of the 20 weirs from the tidal river to the river Kennet at Reading,
and now over 500 salmon return to the Thames each year.2 The abundance of smelt, a cousin of
the salmon, is another good indication of a cleaner river. Pre-spawning shoals gather below
Gravesend during the winter, before going upstream to spawn near Wandsworth in March. It is
not surprising that staff at the Environment Agency, one of whose tasks it is to maintain, improve
and develop all freshwater fisheries in the Thames estuary, refer to the river as ‘London’s largest
wildlife resource’.
The success of the Thames clean-up is
heartening, but the heavy traffic on Vauxhall
Bridge is a sharp reminder of the continuing
fragility of our environment. Westminster has
been declared an Air Quality Improvement
Zone, where ‘drivers of vehicles with dirty
exhausts or parked vehicles with engines
running may be fined’. Air pollution and
traffic congestion have together become a
major environmental issue—a far cry from the
days when my wife, as a child in Putney,
would stare out of the window down the
Lower Richmond Road on a Sunday
afternoon, waiting impatiently for a car to
appear so that she could tell herself that
something had happened. Today the same
road is as time-consuming to cross on Sunday
as it is during the weekday rush-hour (which
seems to last most of the day).
In 1956, there were over 3.75 million cars
licensed to use Great Britain’s roads (and over
1.25 million motorcycles). Ten years later, the
number of licensed cars was 9.5 million, and
by 1996 it had leapt to 22 million (although the
number of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds
had fallen to 739,000).
Much of this astonishing increase in
traffic, in goods vehicles as well as cars, has
been at the expense of the railways. ‘Between
1830 and the 1914—18 war,’ reads the 1958 edition of Britain, ‘the railways were unchallenged as
the chief means of transport in the country.’ At the end of the Second World War, the 1946
edition speaks of Britain still having ‘the most intensive railway system in the world’. The four
main railway companies had ‘a total route mileage of about 20,000 miles (32,000 km), and a total
The flooding Thames
The periodic flooding of the Thames in
and around London predates any concerns
about the effects of global warming on
rising sea levels. In 1983 the Thames
Barrier, which was designed to protect
London against catastrophic flooding,
became operational. Sited near Woolwich
and now an important tourist attraction,
the Barrier has so far been closed 31 times
to stave off the threat of devastating floods.
The busiest year was 1993, when there
were nine separate closures, four of them
in October alone.
The Barrier has never been intended to
stop flooding of the towpaths upstream,
between Putney and Teddington, which
form part of the natural river channel at
times of high spring tides. Many absent-
minded Londoners, myself included, have
parked their cars by the river in this area
and returned a few hours later to find them
full of muddy water, their precious
collection of cassette tapes floating
mournfully around the pedals.
Use of the Barrier is likely to increase in
future, as the south east of England
gradually sinks and sea levels rise.
2 Salmon have also returned in large numbers to other urban and industrial rivers, such as the Clyde, Don, Pother, Taff and
Tyne. Ironically, however, the overall abundance of the species has declined recently, owing to the reduced survival rate of
salmon at sea, possibily as a result of climate change.

track mileage, including sidings, of about 50,000 miles (80,000 km)’. Today, the route network
has halved to 10,000 miles (16,000 km) and the track, at 20,000 miles (32,000 km), is just two-
fifths of what it was 50 years ago.
I remember being driven down to the south coast by my father in the early 1960s, in our old
Ford Consul, for our annual summer holiday by the sea. My brother and I would egg him on to
drive at 100 mph, and he would usually oblige, to the consternation of my mother. On one such
journey, inevitably, I witnessed my first serious car accident. It was a head-on collision, and I
could see quite clearly that the driver and passenger of one car were either dead or very nearly so.
Road deaths in the mid-1960s were running at nearly 8,000 a year. The trial speed limit of
70 mph on motorways and other main roads was not introduced until 1964—65, about the same
time as the first publicity campaign to discourage drinking and driving. Seat-belt wearing for
drivers and front seat passengers did not become law until 1983. Today, these and other
improvements in road safety have reduced road deaths in Great Britain to about 3,500 a year
which, though still an unacceptable price to pay for the convenience of car travel, is nevertheless
the lowest accident death rate for adults in the European Union.
Great Britain has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the world. About seven in every
ten households has access to a car, and more than one in five now owns two or more cars. Inside
the home, the number of consumer items has likewise experienced growth of exponential
proportions. Televisions are a good example: ‘In June 1953 more than one household in six had a
television set; viewers are fairly evenly distributed among all sections of the population,
irrespective of income’ (Britain 1954). Ten years later, four out of every five households had a
TV. Certainly we did, but as children we were not allowed to watch ITV because of the
advertisements. My wife-to-be had no such restrictions placed on her viewing, and would
regularly stay up with her mother until the white dot disappeared on the screen at about
11 o’clock. Today, 99% of homes have a television.
As for other gadgets and household goods, one of the most revealing insights into how
household spending has changed over the years is provided by the Retail Prices Index (RPI),
which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1997. The RPI shows the impact of inflation on family
budgets and how much more we need to spend now in order to buy the same things we bought in
an earlier period. It is like a very large ‘shopping basket’ full of goods and services on which
people typically spend their money.
After 50 years, the RPI naturally reveals some amusing statistics. For example, a pint of milk
that cost 35 pence in 1997 could have been bought for the equivalent of 2 pence in 1947. Better
still, 4 pence worth of cheese in 1947 cost around 60 times as much (£2.42) 50 years later. Over
the years the items in the ‘basket’ have changed to remain fully representative of people’s
shopping patterns, and it is here that the real differences in lifestyle emerge. A comparison of
selected items in 1947 and 1997 says much about the different concerns, priorities and fashions of
the two eras. Here are a dozen items from 1947:
• wild rabbits (before skinning), lard, condensed milk, back lacing corsets, a gallon of lamp oil,
iron bedstead, hair mattresses, gramophone record (78s), rubber roller table mangle, tin of
distemper, a pound of soda, and wireless licence.
Compare those with twelve from 1997:
• burgers, fromage frais, ethnic takeaways, tracksuit bottoms, smoke alarm, microwave oven,
subscription to the Internet, contact lenses, portable CD player, computer games, unleaded
petrol and private medical insurance.
FIFTY NOT OUT
Whereas in 1947 the largest proportion of household expenditure went on food (35%),
followed by drink and tobacco (22%), by 1997 these two categories had fallen to 14% and 11%
respectively. A third of spending now goes on ‘services’—electricity, gas, water, postage,
telephones, holidays, recreation, entertainment, etc—compared with less than a tenth 50 years
ago. Another category that has increased in importance, particularly in the past ten years, is goods
from chemists: it seems that the more medical knowledge we acquire, the more preoccupied we
become with our own health.
The main challenges and priorities facing
the medical profession have also shifted with
time. According to Fighting with Figures:
A Statistical Digest of the Second World War,
the three most frequently notified infectious
diseases in 1945 were scarlet fever,
tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia. Until
comparatively recently, TB appeared to have
been largely conquered by post-war medical
advances, but it is now resurgent throughout
the world. My sister-in-law had TB as an
infant in the early 1950s and spent six months
in hospital. Luckily she recovered and today
teaches geography at a comprehensive school
in Aberdeen. The World Health Organisation
is currently urging the adoption of a course of
treatment, known as DOTS, which is directly
observed by medical practitioners, to prevent
the spectre of a multi-drug-resistant and
therefore incurable strain of TB returning to
haunt the world, rich and poor alike.
Last year was the 50th anniversary of the
National Health Service, which can claim
much of the credit for the major
improvements in health since the Second
World War. In 1948, 40% of deaths occurred
under the age of 65. By 1996, the proportion
had fallen to 17%. The introduction of
antibiotics has seen a fall in the number of
deaths from infectious diseases from 30,142 in
1948 to 3,636 in 1996. Widespread
immunisation for common diseases has also
had a huge impact, particularly on children’s health. For example, between 1948 and 1968
notifications of measles were running at about 400,000 a year. In 1995, there were just 7,447.3
As most of us know from our own circles of acquaintance, however, the news is not all
good. Cancer mortality rates for men aged 15 and over have increased by 15% since 1946-50,
while the rate for women has remained fairly stable. The incidence of cancer has also gone up
Extract from Britain 1956
One traditional social rendezvous, the
public house, has maintained and even
increased its popularity, although there has
been a marked decrease in drunkenness
and in consumption of alcohol per head
since the nineteenth century. The public
house now attracts a very wide circle of
casual customers (both men and women)
as well as many ‘regulars’, who meet for a
drink and a chat, and perhaps to play some
traditional public house game such as
darts. A new, and in some ways rival,
feature of urban life, especially in London,
is the coffee bar. A characteristic of many
of these coffee bars, which stay open until
late at night and are becoming increasingly
popular as a rendezvous for young people,
is their modern decor. On the other hand
many people, especially the married and
the elderly, spend much of their leisure at
home—reading, listening to the radio,
viewing television, or pursuing hobbies.
The most widespread hobbies are
practical, for example, knitting and
needlework for women and gardening for
men. The standard of town and country
gardens is high.

significantly in recent decades: by 34% in women and 18% in men between 1971 and 1992, for
example, although rates continue to be higher among men than women.
The death rate for lung cancer has fluctuated according to smoking patterns. Men smoked a lot
less after the 1960s, when women’s use of tobacco was still increasing. The link with the pattern
for lung cancer is clear: the death rate for men continued to increase until the mid-1970s, since
when it has been falling. For women, though, the death rate from lung cancer only started to level
off in the 1990s, and while the number of smokers has now declined substantially among both
men and women in comparison with 1948, cigarette smoking among children in the UK has
increased during the 1990s.
However, this last gloomy trend cannot completely take the shine off the most indicative
health statistic of all: life expectancy has increased by about nine years since 1948. My
grandmother, now in her 98th year, has lived through a century of extraordinary change. She has
survived two world wars, witnessed a revolution in transport and the creation of the welfare state,
seen electricity permeate every aspect of life, learned to love the telephone, radio and television,
and woken up to the 24-hour society. Only the IT revolution seems to have largely passed her by.
But what is remarkable about the second half of the 20th century—the period covered by the 50
editions of Britain—is the accelerating pace of change. It remains to be seen whether such a
breakneck state of flux—sometimes a stimulating challenge to creativity, at others merely an
assault on the senses—can be sustained into the 21st century, or whether it will finally broaden
out into a slower-paced estuary of measured planning and reflection.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
1 Introduction
Geographical Terms
In this book, ‘Britain’ is sometimes used as a
short way of expressing the full title of the
country: the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland (or, more simply again,
the United Kingdom or the UK). Great
Britain comprises England, Wales and
Scotland only. The adjectives ‘British’ and
‘UK’ have the same meaning and both cover
the whole of the United Kingdom.
Physical Features
The United Kingdom (UK) constitutes the
greater part of the British Isles. The largest of
the islands is Great Britain. The next largest
comprises Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic. Western Scotland is fringed by the
large island chain known as the Hebrides, and
to the north east of the Scottish mainland are
the Orkney and Shetland Islands. All these,
along with the Isle of Wight, Anglesey and the
Isles of Scilly, have administrative ties with
the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish
Sea and the Channel Islands between Great
Britain and France are largely self-governing,
and are not part of the United Kingdom. The
UK is one of the 15 member states of the
European Union (EU).
With an area of about 243,000 sq km
(93,000 sq miles), the United Kingdom is just
under 1,000 km (about 600 miles) from the
south coast to the extreme north of Scotland
and just under 500 km (around 300 miles)
across at the widest point.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom,
they have a special relationship with it. The
• Highest mountain: Ben Nevis, in the
highlands of Scotland, at 1,343 m
(4,406 ft)
• Longest river: the Severn, 354 km
(220 miles) long, which rises in
central Wales and flows through
Shrewsbury, Worcester and
Gloucester in England to the Bristol
Channel
• Largest lake: Lough Neagh, Northern
Ireland, at 396 sq km (153 sq miles)
• Highest waterfall: Eas a’Chual
Aluinn, from Glas Bheinn, in the
highlands of Scotland, with a drop of
200 m (660 ft)
• Deepest cave: Ogof Ffynnon Ddu,
Wales, at 308 m (1,010 ft) deep
• Most northerly point on the British
mainland: Dunnet Head, north-east
Scotland
• Most southerly point on the British
mainland: Lizard Point, Cornwall
• Closest point to mainland continental
Europe: Dover, Kent. The Channel
Tunnel, which links England and
France, is a little over 50 km (31
miles) long, of which nearly 38 km
(24 miles) are actually under the
English Channel.
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries and
remained subject to the English Crown after
the loss of mainland Normandy to the French
in 1204. The Isle of Man was under the
nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266,
and eventually came under the direct

Today the territories have their own legislative
assemblies and systems of law, and their own
taxation systems. The British Government is
responsible for their international relations
and external defence.
The relationship of the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man with the EU is limited to
trading rights only. Rules on customs matters
apply to the Islands under the same conditions
as they apply to the UK. However, the free
movement of persons and services within the
EU as a whole does not extend to the Channel
Islands or the Isle of Man, although the
Islanders do still enjoy their traditional rights
in the UK.
Climate and Wildlife
The climate in the United Kingdom is
generally mild and temperate. Prevailing
winds are south-westerly and the weather
from day to day is mainly influenced by
depressions moving eastwards across the
Atlantic. The weather is subject to frequent
changes. In general, there are few extremes of
temperature; it rarely rises above 32°C (90°F)
or falls below —10°C (14°F).
Average annual rainfall is more than 1,600
mm (over 60 inches) in the mountainous areas
of the west and north but less than 800 mm
(30 inches) over central and eastern parts.
Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the
year but, on average, March to June are the
driest months and September to January the
wettest. During May, June and July (the
months of longest daylight) the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five hours in
northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight. During the months of shortest
daylight (November, December and January)
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of
an hour a day in northern Scotland and two
hours a day on the south coast of England.
Table 1.1 compares the monthly and
annual average temperatures in central
England during the first and last 30 years of
the period 1881-1997. Temperatures in all
months except two are warmer now than they
were at the end of the last century. However,
during June there has been no change, and
February has become slightly cooler. On a
seasonal basis the greatest warming has been
in autumn. The large increase in March
temperatures adds weight to the popular
perception that spring is arriving earlier now
than it used to.
These temperature increases are modest
compared with what may happen in the
future. According to the Hadley Centre for
Climate Prediction and Research, global
warming may cause annual average UK
temperatures to be about 1.5°C warmer by the
2050s compared with the 1961-90 average
(three times the rise between 1881-1910 and
1968-1997). Such an increase could also result
in a rise in average sea levels of 25—35
centimetres.
The UK is home to a great variety of
wildlife, with an estimated 30,000 animal
species, as well as marine and microscopic life;
about 2,800 species of ‘higher’ plants; and
many thousands of mosses, fungi and algae.
However, the unusual weather of recent
years—together with changes in farming
methods, urban development and other
factors—has put pressure on a number of
species.1 In March 1998, over 30 native British
species were given new or increased protection
1 For example, the period between summer 1995 and
winter 1997 was the driest in England and Wales since
weather records began in the 18th century, while April
1998 was the wettest since 1818.

under the Wildlife and Countryside Act,
including the basking shark, water vole, stag
beetle, southern damselfly, pearl mussel and
bluebell. Meanwhile, protection for the viper’s
bugloss moth has been removed, as it is now
considered to be extinct in Britain.
Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a Celtic
original. Although in the prehistoric timescale
the Celts were relatively late arrivals in the
British Isles, only with them does Britain
emerge into recorded history. The term
‘Celtic’ is often used rather generally to
distinguish the early inhabitants of the British
Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in
55 and 54 BC, contact between Britain and the
Roman world grew, culminating in the Roman
invasion of ad 43. Roman rule was gradually
extended from south-east England to include
Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of
Scotland. The final Roman withdrawal in 409
followed a period of increasing disorder
during which the island began to be raided by
Angles, Saxons and Jutes from northern
Europe. It is from the Angles that the name
‘England’ derives. The raids turned into
settlement and a number of small English
kingdoms were established. The Britons
maintained an independent existence in the
areas now known as Wales and Cornwall.
Among these kingdoms more powerful ones
emerged, claiming overlordship of the whole
country, first in the north (Northumbria),
then in the midlands (Mercia) and finally in
the south (Wessex). However, further raids
and settlement by the Vikings from
Scandinavia occurred, although in the 10th
century the Wessex dynasty defeated the
invading Danes and established a wide-
ranging authority in England. In 1066
England was invaded by the Normans (see
p. 6), who then settled along with others from
France.

GARDENS
Athelhampton: winner of the Garden of the Year Award for 1997
(presented by the Historic Houses Association and Christie’s),
Athelhampton, five miles east of Dorchester in Dorset, is probably most famous for its topiary (below).
The gabled 15th-century house (above) sits in the centre of the garden surrounded by massive yews,
a sunken lawn, fountains, a circular corridor of pleached limes, pools, a rectangular canal
with water lilies and, in season, fine collections of tulips, magnolias, clematis, jasmine and rambling roses.
Bodnant: above the River Conwy and with
extensive views of the Snowdonia range,
Bodnant Gardens, seven miles south of
Llandudno in Wales, is most famous for its
laburnum arch (top, photographed in June).
Among the many other interesting features
are a canal terrace, dell garden, curved and
stepped pergola, lily terrace and magnificent
collections of camellias, magnolias and
rhododendrons. The photograph to the right
shows the bridge, waterfall and stream in
spring, bordered by red and pink azaleas
and white rhododendrons.
Keswick: intended as a ‘garden of cosmic speculation’,
and begun in 1990, these gardens were created
by the American architect Charles Jencks and his late wife Maggie Keswick,
and cover 30 acres on the Keswick family estate in south-west Scotland.
Florence Court: Florence Court House
and gardens adjoin Florence Court Forest Park
and are situated eight miles south west of
Enniskillen, Northern Ireland.
A quarter of a mile away is the famous
Florence Court Yew (right). Replanted in 1770,
after it was found growing on the mountain area
of the estate, it is recognised as the parent tree
of all Irish yews.
The top photograph shows Florence Court itself,
built in the mid-18th century by
Sir John Cole, and named after his wife.

England is predominantly a lowland country, although there are upland regions
in the north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the South West, in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. The
greatest concentrations of population are in London and the South East, South
and West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the West Midlands
conurbation, and the north-east conurbations on the rivers Tyne and Tees.
England’s population is expected to rise from 49.1 million in 1996 to 51.8
million in 2016.
Early History
The name ‘England’ is derived from the
Angles, one of the Germanic tribes which
established monarchies in lowland Britain in
the 5th century, after the final withdrawal of
the Romans in 409. The Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms were initially fairly small and
numerous, but gradually larger entities
emerged. Eventually Wessex came to
dominate, following its leading role in
resisting the Danish invasions of the 9th
century. Athelstan (924—39) used the title of
‘King of all Britain’, and from 954 there was a
single Kingdom of England. The present
Royal Family is descended from the old royal
house of Wessex.
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings and became King William I. Many
Normans and others from France came to
settle, French became the language of the
nobility for the next three centuries, and the
legal and social structures were influenced by
those prevailing across the Channel.
When William’s great grandson Henry II,
originally from Anjou, was king (1154—89), his
‘Angevin empire’ stretched from the river
Tweed on the Scottish border, down through
much of France to the Pyrenees. However,
almost all the English Crown’s possessions in
France, after alternating periods of expansion
and contraction, were finally lost during the
late Middle Ages.
England and Wales were integrated
administratively and legally in 1536—42 during
the reign of Henry VIII, and the union of
England and Scotland took place in 1707,
when Queen Anne was Sovereign.
Government
In contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, England has no government minister
6
ENGLAND
or department exclusively responsible for its
central administration. Instead, there are a
number of government departments, whose
responsibilities in some cases also cover
aspects of affairs in Wales and Scotland (see
Appendix 1). A network of nine Government
Offices for the Regions (GOs—see p. 9) is
responsible for the implementation of several
government programmes in the English
regions.1
There are 529 English parliamentary
constituencies represented in the House of
Commons. After the General Election of May
1997, England had 328 Labour Members of
Parliament (MPs), 165 Conservative, 34
Liberal Democrat and one independent.2
Conservative support tends to be strongest in
suburban and rural areas, and the party has a
large number of parliamentary seats in the
southern half of England. The Labour Party
has tended in the past to derive its main
support from the big cities and areas
associated with traditional industry, but it won
many seats in the last General Election that
had previously been considered safe
Conservative constituencies. The Liberal
Democrats, who are strong in the South West,
have recently been gaining greater support in
other parts of England, and the party now has
a third of its 34 English seats in Greater
London and the South East.
Local government is mainly administered
through a two-tier system of counties
subdivided into districts. However, there are a
number of single-tier, or unitary,
authorities—especially in larger cities. The
restructuring of local government in England
was completed in 1998 (see p. 60).
England elects 71 representatives (MEPs)
to the European Parliament (see p. 67), which
meets in full session in Strasbourg for about
1 There were ten Offices, but Merseyside was merged with
the North West in October 1998 to form a single
Government Office for the North West.
2 The Speaker of the House of Commons, who presides
over the debates there (see pp. 40 and 44), traditionally
does not vote along party lines and so is not counted
towards the strength of the party for which he or she was
originally elected. The independent MR is the former
journalist Martin Bell, who won what had been the safe
Conservative seat of Tatton in Cheshire.
one week every month, although its committee
work normally takes place in Brussels.
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions known
as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on the other,
parliamentary and European Community (EC)
legislation. In the formulation of common law
since the Norman Conquest, great reliance has
been placed on precedent. Equity law—law
outside the scope of the common law or statute
law—derives from the practice of petitioning
the Lord Chancellor in cases not covered by
common law.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church at
the time of the Reformation in the early 16th
century, is the Established Church (that is, the
official religion of England). The Sovereign
must always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops (see pp. 241—2).
A new Mayor and Assembly for London
In a referendum in May 1998, the residents of
London voted in favour of having a directly
elected mayor for the capital, and a separately
elected assembly of 25 members.3 Subject to
the necessary legislation going through
Parliament, the mayor and assembly will form
a new Greater London Authority (GLA), the
first elected London-wide body since the
Greater London Council was abolished in
1986. It will have a staff of about 250. The
Government intends to set up the GLA, at a
central location yet to be decided, with a view
to holding the first elections for the mayor and
assembly in late 1999 or 2000. Thereafter,
elections will take place every four years.
There will also be a new body to run
transport in the capital, and new democratic
authorities to oversee the police and fire
services and emergency planning.
3 Although only 35% of the electorate voted, nearly three-
quarters were in favour. The new arrangements will not
affect the continuance of the separate post of Lord Mayor
of London (first established in 1191), whose role is
restricted to the City of London, the financial ‘Square Mile’
at the heart of the capital.

Regional Development Agencies
As part of its plans to improve the economic
performance and competitiveness of the
regions and increase regional decision-making,
the Government is setting up nine Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs) in England.
These are due to come into operation in April
1999 (except in London, where the
development agency will be established as part
of the GLA in 2000), and their boundaries will
coincide with those of the GOs. The RDAs
will bring together the regional regeneration
work previously carried out by English
Partnerships and the Rural Development
Commission (see pp. 355-6), and the GOs. In
many of the regions, existing Regional
Development Organisations, which promote
inward investment, are also expected to merge
with the RDAs. The new Agencies’ purposes
will be:
• to further economic development and
regeneration;
• to promote business efficiency,
investment and competitiveness;
• to promote employment;
• to enhance the development and
applications of skills relevant to
employment; and
• to contribute to the achievement of
sustainable development in the UK.
RDAs will be accountable through ministers
to Parliament. Their boards of 12 members
will be business-led, but will also reflect the
broad range of groups that have an interest in
the regional economy. Four positions on each
board will be filled by local councillors. In
addition, RDAs will be required to take
account of the views of voluntary regional
chambers, designated by the Secretary of
State, in preparing their strategies and
corporate plans, and to give them an account
of their activities.
The Environment
Despite its high population density and degree
of urbanisation, England still has many
unspoilt rural and coastal areas. There are
eight National Parks, nine forest parks,
The Regions of England Covered by the GOs
Note: Merseyside merged with the North West in October

37 designated ‘areas of outstanding natural
beauty’, 22 environmentally sensitive areas,
over 200 country parks approved by the
Countryside Commission, and more than
1,000 km (625 miles) of designated heritage
coastline. There are also nearly 200 National
Nature Reserves, about 600 Local Nature
Reserves and over 4,000 Sites of Special
Scientific Interest.
Culture
London and the other large cities have a
wealth of cultural centres, including major art
galleries, many renowned museums, theatres,
ballet and opera houses, and concert halls.
Many theatres outside London are used for
touring by the national theatre, dance and
opera companies. Popular culture also thrives
in England, as elsewhere in Britain: there are
numerous kinds of pop music, theatre styles
such as pantomime and musicals, jazz festivals
and performances by comedians. Safari,
wildlife and theme parks all offer family

About half of the 1.7 million people in Northern Ireland are settled in the
eastern coastal region, the centre of which is the capital, Belfast. Northern
Ireland is at its nearest point only 21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a 488-
km (303-mile) border with the Irish Republic. Following negotiations lasting
over two years, a comprehensive agreement on a political settlement for
Northern Ireland—the Good Friday Agreement—was reached in April 1998. A
referendum held the following month endorsed the Agreement by 71.1% to
28.8%. Elections to a new Northern Ireland Assembly took place on 25 June 1998
and legislation to implement the whole settlement is at present before
Parliament.
According to the 1991 Census, 50.6% of the
people regarded themselves as Protestants and
38.4% as Roman Catholics. Most of the
Protestants are descendants of Scots or English
settlers who crossed to north-eastern Ireland;
they are British by culture and have
traditionally been committed to remaining part
of the UK. The Roman Catholic population is
mainly Irish by culture and history, and many
are nationalist in political aspiration, favouring
union with the Irish Republic. Northern
Ireland has a younger population with
proportionately more children and fewer
pensioners than any other region in the UK.
History
During the 10th century Ireland was
dominated by the Vikings. In 1169 Henry II of
England invaded Ireland, having been granted
its overlordship by the English Pope Adrian
IV, who was anxious to bring the Irish church
into full obedience to Rome. Although a large
part of the country came under the control of
Anglo-Norman nobles, little direct authority
was exercised from England during the
Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish insurgents.
The main area of resistance was the northern
province of Ulster. After the collapse of this
resistance in 1607 and the flight of its leaders,
Ulster was settled by Protestant immigrants
from Scotland and England.
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further risings in Ireland, which were crushed
11
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE

by Oliver Cromwell. More fighting took place
after the overthrow of the Roman Catholic
James II in 1688. During the Battle of the
Boyne in Ireland in 1690 the forces of James
II, who was trying to regain the throne, starting
in Ireland, were defeated by those of the
Protestant William of Orange (William III).
Throughout most of the 18th century there
was uneasy peace. In 1782 the Irish Parliament
(dating from medieval times) was given
legislative independence; the only
constitutional tie with Great Britain was the
Crown. The Parliament, however, represented
only the privileged Anglo-Irish minority, and
the Roman Catholic majority was excluded
from it. Following the abortive rebellion led
by Wolfe Tone’s United Irishmen movement
in 1798, Ireland was unified with Great
Britain under the 1800 Act of Union. The
Irish Parliament was abolished in 1801 and
Irish members sat in both Houses of the
Westminster Parliament.
The Irish question was one of the major
issues of British politics during the 19th
century. In 1886 the Liberal Government
introduced a Home Rule Bill designed to give
a new Irish Parliament devolved authority
over most internal matters while Britain
maintained control over foreign and defence
policy. This failed as did a second Bill
introduced in 1893.
The issue returned to the political agenda in
1910 because the Liberal Government was
dependent for its political survival on support
from the pro-Home Rule Irish Parliamentary
Party. The controversy intensified as unionists
and nationalists in Ireland formed private
armies. In 1914 Home Rule was approved in
the Government of Ireland Act.
Implementation, however, was suspended by
the outbreak of the First World War.
A nationalist rising in Dublin in 1916 was
suppressed and its leaders executed. Two
years later the nationalist Sinn Fein party won
a large majority of the Irish seats in the general
election to the Westminster Parliament. Its
members refused to attend the House of
Commons and, instead, formed the Dail
Eireann in Dublin. A nationalist guerrilla
force called the Irish Republican Army began
12
NORTHERN IRELAND
operations against the British administration
in 1919.
A settlement was reached in 1920 when the
Government of Ireland Act provided for
separate Parliaments in Northern and
Southern Ireland, subordinate to
Westminster. The Act was implemented in
Northern Ireland in 1921, giving six of the
nine counties of the province of Ulster their
own Parliament with powers to deal with
internal affairs. However, the Act proved
unacceptable in the South, and in 1922,
following negotiations between the British
Government and Sinn Fein, which led to the
Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the 26 counties of
Southern Ireland left the UK to become the
Irish Free State (now the Irish Republic).
Recent Northern Ireland History
From 1921 until 1972 Northern Ireland had
its own Parliament in which the Unionists,
primarily representing the Protestant
community, held a permanent majority and
formed the regional government. The
nationalist minority resented this persistent
domination and their effective exclusion from
political office and influence.
The present unrest began when the 1960s
civil rights movement and responses to it led
to serious intercommunal rioting between the
late 1960s and early 1970s. This led to the
introduction in 1969 of British Army support
for the police. These sectarian divisions were
subsequently exploited by militant nationalists
(principally the Provisional Irish Republican
Army— IRA) and also ‘Loyalist’ terrorist
groups.
Because of increased terrorism and
intercommunal violence, the British
Government took over direct responsibility
for law and order in 1972. The Northern
Ireland Unionist Government resigned in
protest at this decision, the regional
government was abolished, and the present
arrangements for direct rule from
Westminster began. A Secretary of State was
appointed with a seat in the UK Cabinet and
with overall responsibility for the government
of the Province.
Current Government Arrangements
Under the system of direct rule, the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland has overall
responsibility, through the Northern Ireland
Office, for political and constitutional matters,
law and order, policing and criminal justice
policy and community relations. The work of
the Northern Ireland government departments
(see pp. 537-8) is also controlled by the
Secretary of State and a ministerial team. All
laws are approved by the UK Parliament.
Northern Ireland elects 18 Members of
Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons.
In the 1997 General Election the seats were
distributed as follows: Ulster Unionist—10
MPs; Social Democratic & Labour—3; Sinn
Fein—21; Democratic Unionist—2; United
Kingdom Unionist—1. The Alliance Party,
offering an alternative to Unionists and
Nationalists, received 8% of the vote but no
seats. Northern Ireland elects three of the 81
UK representatives to the European
Parliament, by proportional representation.
The Province’s 26 local government district
councils have limited executive functions (see
p. 61). The councils nominate locally elected
representatives to sit as members of the
various statutory bodies set up to administer
regional services, such as education and
libraries, health and personal social services,
drainage and fire services. In June 1997 the
Government announced a number of
initiatives to strengthen local government in
the Province (see p. 61).
The Search for a Political Settlement
The system of direct rule was never intended
to be permanent, and successive British
Governments have made attempts to find a
devolved administration widely acceptable to
both unionist and nationalist political
traditions. In 1974 a unionist-nationalist
coalition Executive was formed but soon
collapsed as a result of a protest strike by those
unionists opposed to power-sharing. In 1982
an Assembly was elected by proportional
representation but was dissolved four years
later because no agreement could be reached

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
between the parties on a devolved
administration.
The British and Irish Governments have
worked closely together for some years in
order to bring peace to Northern Ireland,
accepting the need for new political
arrangements acceptable to both communities
in the Province. This has meant a new
agreement encompassing relations in
Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland
and the Irish Republic, and between the
British and Irish Governments.
Recent Developments
• The Anglo-Irish Agreement signed in 1985
provided a new basis for relations between the
two countries, creating an Intergovernmental
Conference in which both Governments
discuss issues such as improved cross-border
co-operation and security.
• A round of talks aimed at pursuit of a
settlement was set up in 1991 between the
British Government and the four main
constitutional parties (Ulster Unionists,
Democratic Unionists, Alliance Party, and
Social Democratic & Labour Party); in 1992
the Irish Government joined in the
discussions. The talks, however, ended
without agreement. The British Government
continued bilateral talks with the Northern
Ireland parties and separately with the Irish
Government on matters of mutual interest
under the auspices of the Anglo-Irish
Intergovernmental Conference. This work led
to the launch of the negotiations which started
in June 1996 (see below).
• In 1993 the British and Irish Governments
signed the Downing Street Declaration,
setting out the views of the two Governments
on ways towards a future settlement based on
the fundamental principles that the consent of
a majority of people in Northern Ireland
would be required before any constitutional
change could come about. In February 1995
the two Governments published the
Frameworks for the Future documents,
outlining what an overall settlement might
look like. Their aim was to serve as an aid to
discussion and negotiation between the
political parties in Northern Ireland.
• In 1995 the two Governments set up an
independent International Body to examine
the decommissioning of illegally held arms by
paramilitary groups. Chaired by former US
Senator George Mitchell, the International
Body reported in January 1996 that there
should be some decommissioning during the
talks and set out six principles of democracy
and non-violence (the Mitchell Principles) to
which it said all parties should adhere.
• In February 1996 the two Governments
agreed that all-party negotiations should begin
in June 1996, following elections in Northern
Ireland to provide delegates from whom
negotiating teams in all-party talks could be
chosen. The all-party talks were temporarily
suspended in March 1997, following the
announcement of the British General Election
in May.
• The Government which took office in May
1997 declared from the start its intention of
making the talks process as inclusive as
possible, maintaining that any agreement
reached would have to command a broad
measure of support among the parties
representing each of the main communities. A
major breakthrough at the talks occurred in
September 1997, when the participants in the
all-party negotiations—unionists and
nationalists, republicans and loyalists—
launched substantive political negotiations.
• In September 1997 the British and Irish
Governments set up the Independent
International Commission on
Decommissioning to make proposals for
decommissioning terrorist arms and to
monitor its implementation. This body
comprises Commissioners and staff from the
United States, Canada and Finland. It has
since put forward proposals for
decommissioning schemes.
Good Friday Agreement: April 1998
After more than two years of negotiations, the
multi-party talks in Belfast concluded with an
Agreement on 10 April 1998. Legislation was
then passed at Westminster authorising a
referendum on the settlement in Northern
Ireland and permitting elections to a new
Northern Ireland Assembly on 25 June. The
14
NORTHERN IRELAND
Irish Parliament also considered the
Agreement and passed legislation authorising
a concurrent referendum in the Irish
Republic. On 22 May referendums were held
in both parts of Ireland, and the Agreement
received a clear endorsement. Legislation to
implement the whole settlement was
introduced to the Westminster Parliament in
July 1998, and is expected to become law
before the end of the year.

Main Elements of the Agreement
• On constitutional issues, the British and
Irish Governments have formally resolved
their historic differences through the
acceptance of the principle of consent, which
recognises that Northern Ireland is part of the
United Kingdom and will remain so for as
long as that is the wish of a majority of people
who live there; and it affirms that, if the
people of Northern Ireland were formally to
consent to the establishment of a united
Ireland, the Government of the day would
bring forward proposals, in consultation with
the Irish Government, to give effect to that
wish. Under the agreement, the Irish
Government will bring forward proposals to
amend the Irish constitution to bring it into
line with this understanding, and the
necessary changes will also be made to the
British constitutional legislation.
• A new democratically elected Assembly of
108 members will be set up, with full
legislative and executive powers over all
matters currently within the responsibility of
the six Northern Ireland government
departments (see pp. 537-8).
• There will be a North/South Ministerial
Council which will bring together those with
executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland
and the Irish Government, to work together
on matters of mutual interest. All decisions
will be by agreement between the two sides.
Those participating in the Council will be
mandated by, and remain accountable to, the
Assembly and to the Irish Parliament; and at
least six ‘implementation bodies’ will be
identified within the next six months to put
decisions taken by the Council into effect, on
either a cross-border or all-island basis, in
specified areas. These may include, among
others, agriculture, education, transport,
environment, waterways, health and tourism.
• A British-Irish Council will be set up to
bring together the two Governments, and
representatives of devolved administrations in
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, when
established, and from the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man, to address issues of mutual
interest.
• There will be a new British-Irish
Agreement to replace the Anglo-Irish
Agreement of 1985, setting out the new shared
understanding on constitutional matters. It
will set up a new British-Irish
Intergovernmental Conference, to promote
co-operation between the two Governments.
This will be brought into effect as soon as the
other elements of the deal are in place.
Other Issues
Decommissioning. The Agreement commits all
parties to work with the Independent
International Commission on Decommissioning
to use their efforts to achieve decommissioning
of all paramilitary weapons within two years of
the referendum. As part of the Agreement both
Governments undertook to bring the relevant
decommissioning schemes into force by the end
of June 1998. The Independent Commission
will monitor progress and will report to both
Governments at regular intervals.
Policing and Justice. An independent
commission will be set up to consider what

Assembly were held on 25 June, with six
members coming from each of the 18
existing parliamentary constituencies.

In the Assembly the positions of
executive authority and chairmanships and
memberships of committees will be
proportional and based on the number of
seats which each party won at the election.
The executive committee will comprise a
First Minister and his Deputy and up to
ten ministers with departmental
responsibilities. Key decisions will be
taken on a cross-community basis with the
need for significant support from both
unionist and nationalist members elected
to the body.
The Secretary of State will remain
responsible for Northern Ireland Office
matters not devolved to the Assembly, and
the Westminster Parliament (whose power
to make legislation for Northern Ireland
would remain unaffected) will legislate for
non-devolved issues.
police service would be appropriate in a
Northern Ireland free from the threat of
terrorist violence and would be capable of fully
commanding the support of both communities.
It will report by summer 1999. There will be a
parallel review of the criminal justice system
which will report by autumn 1999 (see p. 233).
Release of Prisoners. The Agreement commits
both Governments to make arrangements for
an accelerated programme for the release of
paramilitary prisoners. Legislation was passed
in the Westminster Parliament in July 1998 to
establish the independent Sentence Review
Commission to look at each prisoner’s case
individually to determine eligibility for
release. Most eligible prisoners will qualify for
release on licence within two years.
Implementing the Agreement
The Government aims to transfer powers to
the Assembly, and to establish the
North/South Ministerial Council, the agreed
implementation bodies, the British-Irish
Council and the British-Irish Inter-
Governmental Conference, by early 1999. In
the meantime, following the elections on 25
June, the Assembly has held its inaugural
meeting during which the First and Deputy
First Minister designates were appointed and
committees established to draw up Standing
Orders for the future operation of the body. In
addition the First and Deputy First Ministers
will have primary responsibility for taking
forward a number of matters referred to the
Assembly by the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland. These include other
preparations to implement aspects of the
Good Friday Agreement.
There will also be meetings in shadow form
of the North/South Ministerial Council and
the British-Irish Council. In the North/South
Ministerial Council, representatives from the
transitional Northern Ireland administration
and the Irish Government will undertake a
work programme, in consultation with the UK
Government, covering at least 12 subject
areas, with a view to identifying and agreeing
by 31 October 1998 areas where co-operation
and implementation for mutual benefit will
take place.
Human Rights
Economic and social deprivation persists on
both sides of the Northern Ireland
community. However, on all major social and
economic indicators, Roman Catholics
generally experience higher levels of
disadvantage than Protestants, leading to
feelings of discrimination and alienation which
in turn influence attitudes to political and
16
NORTHERN IRELAND
security issues. Government guidelines aim to
promote fair treatment by ensuring that
policies and programmes do not discriminate
unjustifiably against, for example, people of
different religious beliefs or political opinion,
women, disabled people, ethnic minorities and
people of different sexual orientation. The
Government also provides grant aid to local
government programmes designed to
encourage mutual understanding and
appreciation of cultural diversity; support is
also given to the Cultural Traditions
Programme, which attempts to show that
different cultures do not have to lead to
division. The aim of these initiatives is to
encourage a more pluralistic and tolerant
society with equal esteem for unionist and
nationalist traditions.
At present the Standing Advisory
Commission on Human Rights (SACHR)
advises the Secretary of State on the
effectiveness of anti-discrimination laws and
measures. Direct or indirect discrimination in
employment on grounds of religious belief or
political opinion is unlawful. All public
authorities and all private employers with
more than ten employees are required to
register with the Fair Employment
Commission. There is also compulsory
monitoring of the religious composition of
workforces, continual review of recruitment,
training and promotion procedures, and
affirmative action if fair employment is not
provided. Criminal penalties and economic
sanctions exist for defaulting employers. The
Fair Employment Tribunal deals with
individual complaints about discrimination.
Equality Commission
In response to an extensive review by the
SACHR on fair employment in Northern
Ireland, the Government issued a White Paper
Partnership for Equality in March 1998. This
contains consultative proposals to impose on
all public authorities in Northern Ireland a
legal duty to promote equality of opportunity
in all the services they provide to the public. A
new Equality Commission would take over the
functions of the Fair Employment
Commission, the Equal Opportunities
Commission, the Commission for Racial
Equality and the Disability Council. It would
aim to ensure that the public sector met the
new statutory obligation.
Human Rights Commission
Under the Good Friday Agreement (see pp.
14-16), legislation will be introduced to
establish a new independent Northern Ireland
Human Rights Commission, with an extended
role beyond that at present exercised by the
SACHR. This will consult and advise on the
scope for defining rights supplementary to
those in the European Convention on Human
Rights, which the Government is currently
incorporating into UK law (see pp. 33 and 213).
The Parades Commission
The Parades Commission was set up in March
1997 and given full statutory powers in March
1998 to help resolve disputes over contentious
parades in Northern Ireland. In the absence of
local agreement on contentious parades, the
Commission may make legally binding
determinations, such as imposing route
conditions. The Commission is expected to
make decisions on around 60 such parades in
1998 out of a total of some 3,500.
The vast majority of parades each year are
organised by the Protestant/Unionist
community, especially the ‘Loyal Orders’.
Most take place during the six months from
around Easter to the end of September.
Victims of Violence Commission
A Commission to look at possible ways of
providing greater recognition of the suffering
felt by victims of violence arising from the
events of the last 30 years was set up in
October 1997. The Commission, chaired by
Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, reported in May
1998. The Government has welcomed the
report and is considering its
recommendations.
Security Policy
The authorities have exceptional powers to
deal with and prevent terrorist activities,
17
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
including special powers of arrest for those
suspected of certain serious terrorist offences,
non-jury courts to try terrorist offences (see p.
233) and the banning of terrorist organisations.
The relevant legislation is subject to annual
independent review and to annual approval by
Parliament. The Government has stated that,
once a lasting peace is established, there will be
no need for these exceptional powers and is
keeping the requirement for them under
continuing review.
An Independent Commissioner observes
and reports on the conditions under which
terrorist suspects are detained by the security
forces in police offices known as Holding
Centres.
Statutory codes of practice apply to the
detention, treatment, questioning and
identification of suspects. A breach of any of
the codes’ provisions by a police officer is a
disciplinary offence.
At present an independent commission
supervises police investigations into the more
serious complaints against police officers and,
at its discretion, the investigation of other
matters (see p. 221). Under legislation passed
in July 1998, the Commission is to be replaced
with a new office of Police Ombudsman, to
take effect from March 1999.
Some three-quarters is spent in Northern
Ireland, the rest going to border areas in the
Republic. Programmes cover business
enterprise, tourism, community relations,
urban development, agriculture and rural
development. Donors include the United
States, Canada, New Zealand and the EU.
Northern Ireland currently receives around
£1,300 million under the EU Structural
Funds Programme (see p. 443). Over the
period 1995-99 some £200 million of this
comes from the Special Support Programme
for Peace and Reconciliation. The five areas
eligible for funding are: employment; urban
and rural regeneration; cross-border
development; social inclusion; and productive
investment and industrial development. Up to
80% of funds are allocated to Northern
Ireland, and the remainder must be spent on
cross-border activities.
The 1998 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
to John Hume MP, leader of the Social
Democratic & Labour Party, and David
Trimble MP, leader of the Ulster
Unionists, for their efforts to find a
peaceful solution to the conflict in
Northern Ireland.
Economic Assistance
In 1986 the British and Irish Governments
established the International Fund for Ireland.

Three-quarters of the population of Scotland live in the central lowlands. The
chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital), Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee.
Scotland contains large areas of unspoilt and wild landscape, and many of the
UK’s mountains, including its highest peak, Ben Nevis (1,343 m, 4,406 ft).
Scotland will soon have its own Parliament, for the first time since 1707, and
the new Parliament will acquire responsibility for many functions from the
Parliament at Westminster (London).
Early History
At the time of the Roman invasion of Britain,
what is now Scotland was mainly inhabited by
the Piets. Despite a long campaign, Roman rule
was never permanently extended to most of
Scotland. In the sixth century, the Scots from
Ireland settled in what is now Argyll, giving
their name to the present-day Scotland.
War between the kingdoms of England and
Scotland was frequent in the Middle Ages.
Despite reverses such as the defeat of William
Wallace’s uprising in 1298, Robert the Bruce’s
victory over Edward II of England at
Bannockburn in 1314 ensured the survival of a
separate kingdom of Scotland.
The two crowns were eventually united
when Elizabeth I of England was succeeded in
1603 by James VI of Scotland (James I of
England), who was her nearest heir. Even so,
England and Scotland remained separate
political entities during the 17th century, apart
from an enforced period of unification under
Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s. In 1707 the
English and Scottish Parliaments, opting for
closer political and economic union, agreed on a
single Parliament for Great Britain.
Population
Scotland’s population has changed relatively
little in the last 50 years. In June 1997 the
population was 5.12 million (see Table 4.1),
compared with 5.17 million at the end of 1948
and 5.24 million recorded in the 1971 Census.
Population density averages 66 people per sq
km, the lowest density in the UK and well
below the European Union (EU) average.
Scottish Parliament and Executive
Devolution in Scotland (and Wales) is a key
part of the Government’s programme of
constitutional reform (see chapter 6).
Arrangements for the new Scottish Parliament
and Executive, contained in a White Paper—
Scotland’s Parliament—were endorsed in a
referendum in September 1997:

votes (74.3% ) to 614,400 (25.7%).
• A second question, on the Parliament’s
tax-raising powers (see below), was also
supported, by 1,512,889 votes (63.5%) to

fixed four-year term. The Parliament will be
elected by a method of proportional
representation known as the ‘additional
member system’. Each elector will have two
votes: one for a constituency MSP and a
‘regional’ vote for a registered political party
or an individual independent candidate. There
will be 73 MSPs representing single-member
constituencies, which will have the same
boundaries as the existing parliamentary
constituencies (except that Orkney and
Shetland will be split into two seats). The
remaining 56 MSPs will represent the eight
regions, based on the existing European
parliamentary constituencies, each with seven
members. These will be allocated so that each
party’s overall share of seats in the Parliament,
including the constituency seats, reflects its
share of the regional vote.
Functions
The Scottish Parliament’s responsibilities will
include health; education and training; local
government; housing; economic development;
home affairs and many aspects of civil and
criminal law; transport; the environment;
agriculture, fisheries and forestry; and sport
and the arts.
Where it has responsibility, the Scottish
Parliament will be able to amend or repeal
existing Acts of Parliament and to pass new
legislation. Among the areas where
responsibility will remain with the
Government in Westminster are overseas
affairs, defence and national security, overall
economic and monetary policy, employment
legislation and social security.
The Parliament will meet initially at the
General Assembly Hall in Edinburgh’s Old
Town. A new permanent site for the
Parliament is planned at Holyrood, at the
other end of the Royal Mile. The area is in the
historic centre of Edinburgh, and the previous
Scottish Parliament met from 1640 to 1707 in
Parliament House on the Royal Mile. Work on
the new building is expected to start in 1999,
with a view to completion in the second half
of 2001.
The Scottish Executive will be headed by a
First Minister, who will normally be the
leader of the party able to command majority
support in the Parliament. The Secretary of
State for Scotland will represent Scottish
interests within the UK Government.
The Scottish Parliament and Executive will
have an important role in scrutinising those
aspects of EU business which affect the
21
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
devolved responsibilities. Like other regional
governments in the EU, Scotland will be able
to have its own representative office in
Brussels.
The Scottish Executive will have
responsibility for all public bodies whose
functions and services will be devolved—
around 95 organisations—and will be
accountable to the Parliament for them. The
Commission on Local Government and the
Scottish Parliament is considering how to
build the most effective relationship between
the Parliament/Executive and the 32 local
authorities, and how councils can make
themselves responsive and democratically
accountable to local communities. A survey to
provide extensive information on Scottish
households will begin early in 1999 to ensure
that the Parliament has up-to-date
information on which to base its decisions.
One of the early issues likely to be
considered by the Scottish Parliament is
land reform. To prepare the way, The
Scottish Office has established a Land
Reform Policy Group which is consulting
on various issues affecting land ownership
and management in rural Scotland,
including land use, the rights of landlords
and tenants, crofting, and information
about land. The Group plans to produce
its final proposals for land reform around
the end of 1998.
Financial Arrangements
The Scottish Parliament will have a budget
broadly equivalent to that currently controlled
by the Secretary of State—£14,853 million in
1998-99. Once the amount of the budget has
been determined, the Parliament will be free
to allocate resources across the expenditure
programmes.
The Parliament will have the power to
increase or decrease the basic rate of income
tax—23 pence in the pound—by a maximum
of 3 pence. Liability will be based on
residence. A person will be resident in
Scotland if he or she is a UK resident for tax
purposes and either spends 50% or more of
the tax year in Scotland or has his or her only
or principal home in Scotland.
The Parliament will be responsible for
determining the form of local taxation and, if
it considers it wise to do so, will be able to
alter both the council tax and business rates.
Current Government Arrangements
Scottish administration is at present the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, working through The Scottish
Office. Separate Acts of Parliament are passed
for Scotland where appropriate.
There are 72 Scottish seats in the House of
Commons. Labour has 56 Members of
Parliament (MPs), the Liberal Democrats 10
and the Scottish National Party 6. Scotland
will continue to elect MPs to the Parliament in
Westminster after the establishment of the
Scottish Parliament.
Legal System
The principles and procedures of the Scottish
legal system differ in many respects from
those of England and Wales. These
differences stem, in part, from the adoption of
elements from medieval canon law and
selective borrowing from other European legal
systems, based on Roman law, during the 16th
century. Preservation of Scots law and the
Scottish Courts was provided for in the
Treaty of Union. In addition to separate
courts and a separate legal profession,
Scotland has its own prosecution, prison and
police services.
The Economy
In the last 50 years the economy has moved
away from the traditional industries of coal,
steel and shipbuilding, with the establishment
of the offshore oil and gas industry, growth in
services and, more recently, developments in
high-technology industries, such as chemicals,
electronic engineering and information
technology.
Notable features of the Scottish economy
include:
22
SCOTLAND
• Electronics. Scotland has one of the
biggest concentrations of the electronics
industry in Western Europe, with around
550 units (some 160 companies)
employing about 41,000 workers in 1995.
The industry accounted for around 28%
of manufacturing output in Scotland in
1995 and is the biggest export sector.
A notable electronics scheme is Project
Alba, designed to establish Scotland as the
world’s leading location for ‘Systems Level
Integration’ and the associated ‘System on
a Chip’—major recent developments in
semiconductor technology which will
enable the production of smaller and
lighter electronics products using less
power. It is a joint venture involving
Cadence Design Systems of the US,
Scottish Enterprise (see p. 442) and a
number of other bodies. A new
semiconductor design ‘factory’ will be
built at Livingston, creating nearly 1,900
jobs, including over 1,600 design and
research and development posts. The site
will also feature a new Institute for
Systems Level Integration, which is being
established by Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Strathclyde and Heriot Watt universities,
and will act as a focus for research and
teaching on this subject.
• Oil and gas. Offshore oil and gas
production has made a significant
contribution to the Scottish economy in
the last 30 years. Many of the UK’s 98
offshore oilfields are located to the east of
Shetland, Orkney or the east coast of
Scotland (see map, opposite p. 518).
• Whisky. Whisky continues as one of
Scotland’s most important industries.
There are 92 whisky distilleries in
operation, mostly in the north east.
Whisky exports, valued at nearly £2,400
million in 1997, are Scotland’s second
largest export trade.
• Tourism. In 1997 expenditure by tourists
in Scotland was valued at £2,655 million;
there were 13.2 million tourist trips,
including those originating in Scotland.
In 1996, about 177,000 jobs were related
to the tourism industry.
• Financial services. Funds managed by
financial institutions in Scotland were
some £203,900 million in March 1998, of
which £81,700 million were in long-term
life insurance funds and £55,300 million
in pension funds. Several financial
institutions are based in Scotland,
including insurance companies, fund
managers, unit trusts and investment
trusts. There are four Scottish-based
clearing banks, which have limited rights
to issue their own banknotes.
• Forestry. Scotland accounts for just under
half of the UK’s timber production. In
the last ten years there has been
significant international and local
investment in wood-based panel
production and in pulp and paper
processing.
• Fishing. Fishing remains significant,
particularly in the north east, and the
Highlands and Islands. In 1997, Scotland
accounted for over 65% by weight and
almost 60% by value of the fish landed in
the UK by UK vessels, compared with
26% of the value of fish landed in Great
Britain in 1948. Fish farming,
particularly of salmon, has become much
more important, and Scotland produces
the largest amount of farmed salmon in
the EU (see p. 463).
Education and Culture
The Scottish education system has a number
of distinctive features (see chapter 10),
including a separate system of examinations,
while pupils normally start secondary school
at an average age of 12 rather than at 11 ]h as
occurs in most of the rest of the UK. Pupils
have generally achieved higher results in the
last year of compulsory secondary schooling
than elsewhere in the UK, while Scotland has
the most highly qualified labour force after
that in London, with 42% qualified to at least
Higher standard or equivalent. A new system
of courses and awards for education after 16,
‘Higher Still’, is due to be introduced in
1999-2000. Record numbers of students are
23
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
entering higher education—about 595,000
students were enrolled in further or higher
education in 1996-97, of whom 239,300
students were in higher education, compared
with 120,800 in 1986-87.
Culture
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin, is
spoken by some 70,000 people, many of whom
live in the Hebrides. Government funding for
Gaelic will be £12 million in 1998-99.
Broadcasting is the largest single area,
accounting for £8.5 million. Programmes in
Gaelic totalling about 528 hours were
broadcast on television in 1997, and BBC
Scotland put out 2,340 hours of radio
programmes in Gaelic in 1996—97. Extra
resources are being allocated to supporting
Gaelic education and cultural organisations.
The annual Edinburgh International
Festival is one of the world’s leading cultural
events. Held in August, it brings about £70
million into the Scottish economy each year,
and is the largest arts festival in the UK.
Scotland possesses several major collections of
the fine and applied arts, such as the Burrell
Collection in Glasgow and the Scottish
National Gallery of Modern Art, in
Edinburgh. A new Museum of Scotland is
being built in Edinburgh to house the
National Museums’ Scottish Collection.

Two-thirds of the population of Wales live in the southern valleys and the
lower-lying coastal areas. The chief urban centres are Cardiff (with a
population of 318,000), Swansea and Newport in the south and Wrexham in the
north. Much of Wales is hilly or mountainous. The highest peak is Snowdon
(1,085 m, 3,560 ft). The Welsh name of the country is Cymru.
A National Assembly for Wales is being set up to give the people of Wales
greater control over their own affairs. Elections to the Assembly will be held in
May 1999.
Cardiff was chosen to host the European Council Summit in June 1998, which
took place at the end of the UK’s six-month presidency of the European Union (EU).
Early History
After the collapse of Roman rule (see p. 6),
Wales remained a Celtic stronghold, although
often during Norman times within the English
sphere of influence. In 1282 Edward I
completed a successful campaign to bring Wales
under English rule. The great castles that he
built in north Wales remain among the UK’s
finest historic monuments (see p. 328). Edward
Fs eldest son—later Edward II—was born at
Caernarfon in 1284 and was given the title
Prince of Wales, which continues to be borne by
the eldest son of the reigning monarch.
Continued strong Welsh national feeling
culminated in the unsuccessful rising led by
Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the 15th
century. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled
England from 1485 to 1603, was of Welsh
ancestry. The Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542
united England and Wales administratively,
politically and legally.
Population
The population has risen by 10% since 1961
and in 1997 amounted to 2.9 million (see
Table 5.1). Wales has the second highest
proportion of people of pensionable age (men
of 65 and over and women of 60 and over) in
the UK—only south-west England has a
higher proportion—and the lowest proportion
of those in the age group 16 to 44.
Current Government Arrangements
Wales has 40 Members of Parliament (MPs) in
the House of Commons. Labour has usually
had a majority of seats, and currently has 34

The Secretary of State for Wales has
responsibility for a range of public services,
which are funded from an annual budget for
the Welsh Office (with headquarters in
Cardiff) of around £7,000 million.
National Assembly for Wales
Government proposals for devolution in
Wales were endorsed in a referendum in
September 1997 by 559,419 votes (50.3%) to
552,698 (49.7%). The Government of Wales
Act 1998 provides for the establishment of the
new Assembly.
Electoral System
The first election to the Assembly will be in
May 1999. Electors will have two votes: one
for a candidate in their local constituency and
one for a party list. The Assembly will have 60
members:
• 40 from local constituencies (which will
be the same as the House of Commons
constituencies); and
• 20 from electoral regions—four for each
of the five European parliamentary
constituencies—to be elected by the
additional member system of
proportional representation.

Functions
The Assembly will take over virtually all the
Secretary of State’s functions, including
economic development; agriculture, forestry,
fisheries and food; education and training;
industry; local government; health and
personal social services; housing; the
environment; planning; transport and roads;
arts, culture and the Welsh language; ancient
monuments and historic buildings; and sport
and recreation.
Among the functions that will remain with
the Government in London are foreign affairs,
defence, taxation, overall economic policy,
social security and broadcasting. The office of
Secretary of State for Wales will continue,
with a seat in the Cabinet, and Wales will
retain full representation in the Parliament in
London.
The Assembly will have powers to make
secondary legislation (see p. 47) to meet
distinctive Welsh circumstances. It will treat
the English and Welsh languages equally in all
its work.
A First Secretary will head the Assembly
and appoint a Cabinet of‘secretaries’.
Regional committees will ensure the
involvement of all parts of Wales. A National
Assembly Advisory Group has held meetings
throughout Wales to seek views on how the
Assembly will operate.
27
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
The Assembly’s headquarters will be in
Cardiff. Initially it will meet in May 1999 in
the Council Chamber at Cardiff University,
part of the University of Wales (founded in
1893 and one of Wales’ oldest institutions),
and then move to Crickhowell House on
Cardiff Bay. A new building, which will
provide the Assembly’s Chamber and
associated facilities and will be linked to
Crickhowell House, is planned to be ready
for use by 2001.
Local Government and Other Public Bodies
The Assembly will respect the powers of local
government, with the emphasis on local
decisions being taken at a local level. A
Partnership Council will be set up, comprising
members from the Assembly and from the 22
unitary local authorities (see map on p. 26).
The Assembly will control non-
departmental public bodies—there are over 80
in Wales, spending more than £2,000 million
a year. Action is currently being taken to
reduce their number and to increase their
effectiveness and accountability. For example:
• a new ‘economic powerhouse’ came into
operation in October 1998—this is an
expanded Welsh Development Agency
(WDA, see p. 357) and incorporates the
Development Board for Rural Wales (see
p. 357) and the Land Authority for Wales
(see p. 357); and
• Tai Cymru (Housing for Wales, see p.
350) will be integrated into the Welsh
Office by January 1999.
Welsh Language
At the time of the 1991 census 19% of the
population said that they spoke Welsh. In
much of the rural north and west, Welsh
remains the first language of most of the
population.
The Government has reaffirmed its
commitment to enhancing Welsh culture and
developing greater use of the Welsh language.
Welsh is now more widely used for official
purposes and in broadcasting, while most road
signs are bilingual. Welsh medium education
in schools is encouraged. Welsh is taught—as
a first or second language—to most pupils
between the ages of 5 and 16. In addition,
other subjects are taught in Welsh in about
500 schools, in both the primary and
secondary sectors, mainly in the traditionally
Welsh-speaking, largely rural areas.
In April 1998 the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) issued a consultative
document outlining proposals for
improving the level of its service for Welsh
speakers. ONS already facilitates services
in the Welsh language, including bilingual
registration of births, marriages and deaths
in Wales and bilingual survey forms.
English and Welsh are to be treated
equally in the arrangements for the Census
in 2001.
The Welsh Language Act 1993 established
the principle that, in public business and the
administration of justice in Wales, Welsh and
English should have equal treatment. The
Welsh Language Board aims to promote and
facilitate the use of the Welsh language;
in 1998-99 its gross expenditure will be
£5.8 million. Its main priorities include:
• increasing the number of people able to
speak Welsh;
• providing more opportunities to use the
language and encouraging people to take
advantage of these opportunities; and
• strengthening Welsh as a community
language.
Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the Welsh economy, with
expansion in service industries and the
development of a more diverse range of
manufacturing industries, including many at
the forefront of technology. Wales had the
highest gross value added per person
28
WALES
employed in manufacturing in the UK in
1996, at £35,200.
Two of Wales’ traditional industries have
experienced contrasting fortunes in the last
30 years. Output of deep-mined coal has
fallen from 16 million tonnes in 1970 to
around 2 million tonnes a year, and nearly
all of the 54 deep mines operating in 1970
have been closed. However, opencast
mining output—also around 2 million
tonnes a year—is slightly higher than in
1970. Crude steel production, on the other
hand, has grown from 5.5 million tonnes in
1975 to around 7.5 million tonnes in 1996
and Wales’ share of UK steel output has
risen from 27% to 42%.
Wales is an important centre for consumer
electronics, information technology,
automotive components, chemicals and
materials, and food and drink. Around 35,000
people are employed in the manufacture of
optical and electrical equipment, and over
20,000 in the automotive components sector,
where annual sales are about £1,700 million.
In the service sector the most marked growth
has been in financial and business services,
and leisure services.
A key feature of the economy has been the
success in attracting investment from overseas
companies and from elsewhere in the UK.
Since 1983, 1,840 inward investment projects
have been recorded in Wales, bringing in total
investment of £11,800 million and promising
the creation and safeguarding of almost
180,000 jobs. Overseas-owned manufacturing
companies in Wales employ over 75,000
people.
In July 1998 the Government issued
Pathway to Prosperity: A New Economic
Agenda for Wales, setting out its views on the
economic future for Wales. Among the
measures designed to boost job creation and
increase investment are:
• a more coherent approach to indigenous
and inward investment, to be undertaken
by the expanded WDA;
• a stronger system of support for business,
to encourage the prosperity of small and
medium-sized firms;
• a new Entrepreneurship Action Plan for
Wales, to be co-ordinated by the WDA,
to develop a stronger business culture in
Wales;
• a new Rural Partnership, which will
prepare options for a rural strategy for
consideration by the National Assembly;
and
• stronger export services.
Environment
Wales has a rich and diverse natural heritage.
About one-quarter of Wales is designated as a
National Park or Area of Outstanding Natural
Beauty (see p. 320). As well as three National
Parks—Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and
the Pembrokeshire Coast—and five Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty, there are two
national trails, 31 country parks and large
stretches of heritage coast. There are 62
National Nature Reserves and over 900 Sites
of Special Scientific Interest, and also a
number of internationally important nature
conservation sites in Wales. There are 43 sites
proposed for designation as Special Areas of
Conservation under the European Community
(EC) Habitat Directive, 13 Special Protection
Areas classified under the EC Wild Birds
Directive and ten wetlands of international
importance designated under the Ramsar
Convention (see p. 325).
Cultural and Social Affairs
Welsh literature has a long tradition and can
claim to be one of the oldest in Europe. The
Welsh people have strong musical traditions
and Wales is well known for its choral singing,
while both the Welsh National Opera and the
BBC National Orchestra of Wales have
international reputations. Special festivals,
known as eisteddfodau, encourage Welsh
literature and music. The largest is the annual
Royal National Eisteddfod, consisting of
competitions in music, singing, prose and
poetry entirely in Welsh. Artists from all over
29
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
the world come to Llangollen for the annual
International Musical Eisteddfod.
The National Museums and Galleries of
Wales include the Museum of Welsh Life at
St Fagans, near Cardiff; and the Museum of
North Wales at Llanberis, which has recently
been rebuilt. The main museum in Cardiff
contains many paintings by Welsh artists,
including Augustus John and Kyffyu
Williams. The National Library of Wales at
Aberystwyth contains over 4 million books.
An active local press includes several Welsh
language publications. The fourth television
channel, Sianel Pedwar Cymru (S4C),
broadcasts in Welsh during peak viewing
hours and is required to ensure that a
significant proportion of its output is in
Welsh.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game. Wales will stage the final of the
Rugby World Cup in October 1999. This will
be at Cardiff Arms Park, which is being
substantially rebuilt, at a cost of some £114
million.

A major programme of constitutional reform is in progress. Its aim is to
decentralise power, open up government, reform Parliament and increase
individual rights. Following referendums in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland to confirm popular support for devolving power from Westminster,
legislation was passed in 1998 to set up a Scottish Parliament and a National
Assembly for Wales; a Bill is at present before Parliament to establish a new
Northern Ireland Assembly. Other plans include: setting up a city-wide
authority and directly elected mayor for London; increasing the openness of
government through a Freedom of Information Act; holding a referendum on
the voting system for the House of Commons; reforming the House of Lords;
and creating an independent national statistical service. A further Bill before
Parliament proposes introducing proportional representation for elections to
the European Parliament, while legislation passed in October 1998 incorporates
the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law.
The Constitution
The system of parliamentary government in the
United Kingdom is not based on a written
constitution, but is the result of gradual
evolution over many centuries. The constitution,
unlike that of most other countries, is not set out
in any single document. Instead it is made up of
statute law, common law and conventions.1
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement, and is
1 Conventions are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as indispensable to the
working of government.
thus adaptable to changing political
conditions.
The organs of government overlap but can
be clearly distinguished:
Parliament is the legislature and the supreme
authority. The executive consists of: the
Government—the Cabinet and other ministers
responsible for national policies; government
departments and agencies, responsible for national
administration; local authorities, responsible for
many local services; public corporations,
responsible for operating particular nationalised
industries; independent bodies responsible for
regulating the privatised industries; and other
bodies, subject to ministerial control.
31
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The judiciary (see chapter 14) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
Origins of Government
The origins of government in the UK are to
be found in each of its four component parts:
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. England was united as a kingdom
over a thousand years ago, and Wales became
part of the kingdom during the Middle Ages
(see p. nn). The thrones of England and
Scotland were dynastically united in 1603, and
in 1707 legislation passed in the two countries
provided for the establishment of a single
Parliament of Great Britain with supreme
authority both in England and Wales and in
Scotland (see p. 19). Ireland had had links
with the kingdom of England since the 13th
century, and in 1800 the creation of the
United Kingdom was completed by a union
joining the Irish Parliament to that of Great
Britain (see p. nn). In 1922 Southern Ireland
(now the Irish Republic) became an entirely
separate and self-governing country. The six
counties of Northern Ireland had been given
their own subordinate Parliament in 1920, and
voted to remain within the United Kingdom.
The British Parliament at Westminster in
London with an elected chamber comprising
members from English, Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland constituencies thus
represents people sharing very varied
backgrounds and traditions. It has ultimate
authority for government and law-making, but
administrative arrangements have developed
in such a way as to take account of the
particular needs of different areas.
Current Administration of Scottish,
Welsh and Northern Ireland Affairs
England and Wales on the one hand and
Scotland on the other have different systems
of law, a different judiciary, different
education systems, different systems of local
government and, for most domestic matters,
different government departments. Wales has
its own language and cultural traditions. In
Scotland, at present, departments are grouped
under a Secretary of State—a Cabinet
minister with a ministerial team—who has
responsibility in Scotland for a wide range of
policy matters. The distinctive conditions and
needs of Scotland and its people are also
reflected in separate Scottish legislation on
many domestic matters. The administration of
Welsh affairs is at present the responsibility of
the Secretary of State, who is also a member of
the Cabinet, with a ministerial team working
through the Welsh Office.
The UK Government assumed direct
responsibility for Northern Ireland in 1972 (see
p. 13), and a Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, with a seat in the Cabinet, has been in
charge of the Northern Ireland Office.
Progress towards Devolution
The Government’s programme for
decentralising power to Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland is in progress. Referendums
held in Scotland and Wales in September 1997
endorsed proposals to devolve power from
Parliament at Westminster to a Scottish
Parliament (see p. 19) and a National
Assembly for Wales (see p. 26). Legislation
has now been passed to establish these bodies,
and elections to the Scottish Parliament and
the National Assembly for Wales will be held
in May 1999.
The Scottish Parliament will have law¬
making powers, including defined and limited
financial powers to vary revenue. It will
extend democratic control over the
responsibilities currently exercised by The
Scottish Office. The National Assembly for
Wales will provide democratic control over the
existing Welsh Office functions. It will have
secondary legislative powers and will be able
to reform and control the non-departmental
public bodies (NDPBs—see p. 54) in Wales.
The Scottish and Welsh bodies will each be
elected by a combination of a simple majority
system and proportional representation.
A comprehensive agreement on a political
settlement for Northern Ireland—the Good
Friday Agreement—was reached in April
1998, and following a referendum endorsing
the agreement, elections to a new Northern
Ireland Assembly were held in June 1998. The
Assembly has been operating in shadow form
since then. Legislation to implement the
settlement is before Parliament (see chapter 3).
32
GOVERNMENT
The responsibilities of the Westminster
Parliament will remain unchanged over
economic and monetary policy, overseas
affairs, defence and national security.
Human Rights Act 1998
Legislation was passed in October 1998 to
incorporate the European Convention on
Human Rights into domestic law. This will
enable people in the UK to secure decisions
on their human rights from British courts and
not just from the European Court of Human
Rights in Strasbourg.
Until the passage of this Act, the UK was
virtually alone among the major nations of
Western Europe in having no direct means for
its citizens to assert their Convention rights
through their national courts. British courts
could only take the Convention into account
in certain limited circumstances, and when
any breach of the Convention was found by
the European Court in Strasbourg, courts in
the UK were bound to amend domestic laws
and procedures to make good the breach and
to prevent a recurrence.
The new legislation makes it unlawful for
public authorities to act in a way that is
incompatible with the Convention rights and
enables the courts to award whatever remedy
within their jurisdiction they see fit in the
event of a breach (see chapter 14).
In the Government’s view, incorporation of
the Convention will increase the judges’
powers to protect the individual against the
abuse of power by the State.
The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. Queen Elizabeth II is herself
directly descended from King Egbert, who
united England under his rule in 829. The
only interruption in the history of the
Monarchy was the republic, which lasted from
1649 to 1660.
Today the Queen is not only Head of State,
but also a symbol of national unity. The
Queen’s title in the UK is: ‘Elizabeth the
Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and of Her other Realms and
Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man
the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor.
The Commonwealth
Although the seat of the Monarchy is in the
UK, the Queen is also head of state of a
number of Commonwealth states.2 In each of
these states the Queen is represented by a
Governor-General, appointed by her on the
advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and completely independent of the
British Government.
In UK Overseas Territories (see p. 74) the
Queen is usually represented by governors,
who are responsible to the British
Government for the administration of the
countries concerned.
Succession, Accession and Coronation
The title to the Crown is derived partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has always been
preserved. Sons of the Sovereign have
precedence over daughters in succeeding to
the throne. When a daughter succeeds, she
becomes Queen Regnant, and has the same
powers as a king. The consort of a king takes
her husband’s rank and style, becoming
Queen. The constitution does not give any
special rank or privileges to the husband of a
Queen Regnant.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700,
only Protestant descendants of Princess
Sophia, the Electress of Hanover (a
granddaughter of James I of England and VI
of Scotland) are eligible to succeed. The order
of succession can be altered only by common
2 The other Commonwealth states of which the Queen is
head of state are: Antigua and Barbuda; Australia;
Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Canada; Grenada; Jamaica;
New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; St Christopher and
Nevis; Saint Lucia; St Vincent and the Grenadines;
Solomon Islands; and Tuvalu.
33
GOVERNMENT
consent of the countries of the
Commonwealth of which the Monarch is
Sovereign.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as
soon as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed
at an Accession Council, to which all members
of the Privy Council (see p. 36) are
summoned. Members of the House of Lords
(see p. 38), the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
and other leading citizens of the City of
London are also invited.
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey in
London, in the presence of representatives of
the Houses of Parliament and of all the major
public organisations in the UK. The Prime
Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations and representatives of
other countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she is
head of the executive, an integral part of the
legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the
established Church of England. As a result of
a long process of evolution, during which the
Monarchy’s absolute power has been
progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the
advice of her government ministers. The UK
is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in
the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to ministers, the Queen
still takes part in some important acts of
government. These include summoning,
proroguing (discontinuing until the next
session without dissolution) and dissolving
Parliament; and giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by Parliament. The Queen formally
appoints important office holders, including
the Prime Minister and other government
ministers (see p. 42), judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, diplomats, bishops
and some other senior clergy of the Church of
England. She is also involved in pardoning
people wrongly convicted of crimes; and in
conferring peerages, knighthoods and other
honours.3 In international affairs the Queen, as
Head of State, has the power to declare war
and make peace, to recognise foreign states
and governments, to conclude treaties and to
annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are now performed
by government ministers, who are responsible
to Parliament and can be questioned about
particular policies. It is not necessary to have
Parliament’s authority to exercise these
prerogative powers, although Parliament may
restrict or abolish such rights.
The Queen holds Privy Council meetings
(see p. 36), gives audiences to her ministers
and officials in the UK and overseas, receives
accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She must be
consulted on every aspect of national life, and
must show complete impartiality.
The law provides for a regent to be
appointed to perform the royal functions if the
monarch is totally incapacitated. The regent
would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, then those, in order of succession to
the throne, aged 18 or over. In the event of her
partial incapacity or absence abroad, the
Queen may delegate certain royal functions to
the Counsellors of State (the Duke of
Edinburgh, the four adults next in line of
succession, and the Queen Mother).
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with the
British monarchy, and many traditional
ceremonies continue to take place. Royal
marriages and funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch or
head of state visits the UK and investitures are
held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of
Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow honours.
3 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on
the advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the
Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.
35
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Each year the Queen and other members of
the Royal Family visit many parts of the UK.
They are also closely involved in the work of
many charities. For example, the Prince of
Wales is actively involved in The Prince’s
Trust, set up to encourage small firms and
self-employment in inner cities, while the
Princess Royal is President of the Save the
Children Fund. The Queen pays state visits to
foreign governments, accompanied by the
Duke of Edinburgh. She also tours the other
countries of the Commonwealth.
Royal Income and Expenditure
The expenditure arising from the Queen’s
official duties is met by the Civil List and by
government departments, which meet the cost
of, for example, royal travel (£16.4 million in
1998-99), the upkeep of the royal palaces
(£15.8 million in 1998-99) and media and
information services (£471,000 in 1998-99).
The Civil List is a payment from public funds
approved by Parliament to meet the costs of
running the Royal Household.
In 1991 Civil List payments were fixed at
£7.9 million a year for ten years. About three-
quarters of the Queen’s Civil List provision is
required to meet the cost of staff. Under the
Civil List, the Queen Mother and the Duke of
Edinburgh receive annual parliamentary
allowances (together amounting to £1 million)
to enable them to carry out their public duties.
Each year the Queen refunds the Government
for all parliamentary allowances received by
other members of the royal family. The Prince
of Wales does not receive a parliamentary
annuity, since as Duke of Cornwall he is
entitled to the annual net revenues of the
estate of the Duchy of Cornwall.
The Queen’s private expenditure as
Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which
is financed mainly from the revenues of the
Duchy of Lancaster;4 her expenditure as a
private individual is met from her own
personal resources.
4 The Duchy of Lancaster is a landed estate which has
been held in trust for the Sovereign since 1399. It is kept
quite apart from his or her other possessions and is
separately administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster.
Since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid
income tax on all personal income and on that
part of the Privy Purse income which is used
for private purposes. The Queen also pays tax
on any realised capital gains on her private
investments and on the private proportion of
assets in the Privy Purse. In line with these
changes, the Prince of Wales pays income tax
on the income from the Duchy of Cornwall so
far as it is used for private purposes.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the King’s Court,
which assisted the Norman monarchs in
running the government. As the system of
Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, much of the role of the Privy Council
was assumed by the Cabinet, although the
Council retained certain executive functions.
Some government departments originated as
committees of the Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen on the approval
of Orders in Council (which are made under
prerogative powers, such as Orders approving
the grant of Royal Charters of incorporation,
and under statutory powers, which enact
subordinate legislation). Responsibility for
each Order, however, rests with the minister
answerable for the policy concerned,
regardless of whether he or she is present at
the meeting where approval is given.
The Privy Council also advises the
Sovereign on the issue of royal proclamations,
such as those summoning or dissolving
Parliament. The Council’s own statutory
responsibilities, which are independent of the
powers of the Sovereign in Council, include
supervising the registration authorities of the
medical and allied professions.
There are 480 Privy Counsellors, consisting
of all members of the Cabinet, other senior
politicians, senior judges and some
appointments from the Commonwealth.
Membership of the Council, with the style of
‘Right Honourable’, is retained for life, except
for very occasional removals. It is accorded by
the Sovereign on the recommendation of the
Prime Minister. A full Council is summoned
36
GOVERNMENT
only on the accession of a new Sovereign or
when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees. These include prerogative
committees, such as those dealing with
legislation from the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, and with applications for charters
of incorporation. Committees may also be
provided for by statute, such as those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the
Scottish universities. Except for the Judicial
Committee, membership is confined to
members of the current administration.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is primarily the final court of appeal
from courts in UK Overseas Territories and
those independent Commonwealth countries
which retained this avenue of appeal after
independence. The Committee also hears
appeals from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, and from the disciplinary and health
committees of the medical and allied
professions. It has a limited jurisdiction to
hear certain ecclesiastical appeals. In 1997 the
Judicial Committee heard 82 appeals and 82
petitions for special leave to appeal.
The members of the Judicial Committee
include the Lord Chancellor, the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, other Privy Counsellors
who hold or have held high judicial office and
certain judges from the Commonwealth.
Administrative work is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the President of
the Council, a Cabinet minister.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of their
own revenue. If extra resources were needed
for an emergency, such as a war, the Sovereign
would seek to persuade his barons, in the
Great Council—a gathering of leading men
which met several times a year—to grant aid.
During the 13th century several English kings
found the private revenues and baronial aids
insufficient to meet the expenses of
government. They therefore summoned not
only the great feudal magnates but also
representatives of counties, cities and towns,
primarily to get their assent to extraordinary
taxation. In this way the Great Council came
to include those who were summoned by
name (those who, broadly speaking, were to
form the House of Lords) and those who
represented communities—the Commons.
The two parts, with the Sovereign, became
known as ‘Parliament’ (which originally meant
a meeting for parley or discussion).
Over the course of time the Commons
began to realise the strength of their position.
By the middle of the 14th century the formula
had appeared which in substance was the
same as that used nowadays in voting supplies
to the Crown—that is, money to the
government—namely, ‘by the Commons with
the advice of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal’. In 1407 Henry IV pledged that
henceforth all money grants should be
approved by the Commons before being
considered by the Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent of his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions, the
Commons gained the right to submit
collective petitions. During the 15th century
they gained the right to participate in giving
their requests—their ‘Bills’—the form of law.
The subsequent development of the power
of the House of Commons was built upon
these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the 17th century led to
Parliament’s securing its position as the
supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up
Parliament—the Sovereign, the House of
Lords and the elected House of Commons—
are constituted on different principles. They
meet together only on occasions of symbolic
significance such as the State Opening of
Parliament, when the Commons are
summoned by the Sovereign to the House of
37
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Lords. The agreement of all three elements is
normally required for legislation, but that of
the Sovereign is given as a matter of course.
Parliament can legislate for the UK as a
whole, or for any parts of it separately. It can
also legislate for the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies and
not part of the UK. They have local legislatures
which make laws on island affairs (see p. 2).
As there are no legal restraints imposed by
a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases, subject to the UK’s
obligations as a member of the European
Union (see p. 67). It can make or change any
law, and overturn established conventions or
turn them into law. It can even prolong its
own life beyond the normal period without
consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The House
of Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and in this century the House of
Lords has recognised the supremacy of the
elected chamber. The system of party
government helps to ensure that Parliament
legislates with its responsibility to the
electorate in mind.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide (by voting for taxation) the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is
also informed before important international
treaties and agreements are ratified. The
making of treaties is, however, a royal
prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice General Elections are
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Dissolution of Parliament and
writs for a General Election are ordered by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime
Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
sessions. Each usually lasts for one year—
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ at night,
at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and the late
Spring Bank Holiday, and during a long
summer break usually starting in late July.
The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a
session is about 165 in the House of Commons
and about 150 in the House of Lords. At the
start of each session the Sovereign’s speech to
Parliament outlines the Government’s policies
and proposed legislative programme. Each
session is ended by prorogation. Parliament
then ‘stands prorogued’ for about a week until
the new session opens. Prorogation brings to
an end nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The Lords
Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, the Bishops of London, Durham
and Winchester, and the 21 next most senior
diocesan bishops of the Church of England.
The Lords Temporal consist of:
• all hereditary peers of England, Scotland,
Great Britain and the United Kingdom
(but not peers of Ireland);
• life peers created to assist the House in its
judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or ‘law
lords’);5 and
• all other life peers.
5 The House of Lords is the final court of appeal for civil
cases in the UK and for criminal cases in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.

Note: excludes peers without Writ of Summons (68) or on leave of absence (65).
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in the
House provided holders establish their claim
and are aged 21 years or over. However, anyone
succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months
of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or
her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to sit
in the House but gain the right to vote and
stand as candidates at parliamentary elections.
When a disclaimant dies, the peerage passes on
down the family in the usual way.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other walks
of life or because one of the political parties
wishes to have the recipient in the House of
Lords. The House also provides a place in
Parliament for people who offer useful advice,
but do not wish to be involved in party politics.
There are three main political parties
represented in the Lords; the number of peers
eligible to sit and declaring party allegiance is
shown in Table 6.1.
Members of the House of Lords (the
average daily attendance is about 380) receive
no salary for their parliamentary work, but can
claim for expenses incurred in attending the
House (for which there are maximum daily
rates) and certain travelling expenses.
In May 1998 there were 1,139 members of
the House of Lords, including the two
archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords
Temporal consisted of 625 hereditary peers
who had succeeded to their titles, 9 hereditary
peers who had had their titles conferred on
them (including the Prince of Wales), and 479
life peers, of whom 39 were ‘law lords’. There
were 93 women peers.
The total potential membership of the
House is reduced by about 60 by a scheme
which allows peers who do not wish to attend
to apply for leave of absence for the duration of
a Parliament. In addition some hereditary peers
do not receive a writ of summons entitling
them to sit in the House, for example, because
they have not established their claim to succeed
or because they are minors.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack6 as ex-officio Speaker of the House.
In the Lord Chancellor’s absence, his place is
taken by a deputy.
As Clerk of the House of Lords, the Clerk
of the Parliaments is responsible for the
records of proceedings of the House of Lords
and for the text of Acts of Parliament. He is
the accounting officer for the House, and is in
charge of its administrative staff, known as the
Parliament Office. The Gentleman Usher of
the Black Rod, usually known as ‘Black Rod’,
is responsible for security, accommodation
and services in the House of Lords’ part of the
Palace of Westminster.
Proposals for Reform
The Government intends to introduce
legislation to end the right of hereditary peers

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
to sit and vote in the House of Lords. This
will be the first stage in a process of reform
designed to make the House of Lords more
democratic and representative.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by universal
adult suffrage (see below) and consists of 659
Members of Parliament (MPs). In July 1998
there were 121 women and 9 MPs from ethnic
minorities. Of the 659 seats, 529 are for
England, 40 for Wales, 72 for Scotland, and 18
for Northern Ireland. The number of Scottish
seats will be reviewed after the Scottish
Parliament has been set up (see chapter 4).
General Elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Sovereign. When an MP
dies or resigns,7 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £45,066 (from 1 April 1998 to
31 March 1999) and an office costs allowance
(from April 1998) of up to £49,232. Other
allowances include travel allowances, a
supplement for London members and, for
provincial members, subsistence allowances
and allowances for second homes. (For
ministers’ salaries see p. 52)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is
the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside over
the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two deputy
chairmen, who act as Deputy Speakers. They
are elected by the House on the nomination of
the Government but are drawn from the
Opposition as well as the government party.
They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
except in their official capacity. Responsibility
for the administration of the House rests with
the House of Commons Commission, a
statutory body chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
7 An MP who wishes to resign from the House can do so
only by applying for an office under the Crown as Crown
Steward or Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of
the Manor of Northstead.
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker on
the House’s privileges and procedures. The
Clerk is also accounting officer for the House.
The Serjeant at Arms, who waits upon the
Speaker, carries out certain orders of the
House. He is also the official housekeeper of
the Commons’ part of the building, and is
responsible for security. Other officers serve
the House in the Library, the Department of
the Official Report {Hansard), the Finance and
Administration Department, and the
Refreshment Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes the UK is divided into
constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons. To ensure
that constituency electorates are kept roughly
equal, four permanent Parliamentary
Boundary Commissions, one each for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, keep constituencies under review.
They recommend any adjustment of seats that
may seem necessary in the light of population
movements or other changes. Reviews are
conducted every 8 to 12 years.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and citizens of the
Irish Republic resident in the UK, may vote
provided they are:
• aged 18 or over;
• included in the annual register of electors
for the constituency; and
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote.
People not entitled to vote include young
people under 18, members of the House of
Lords, foreign nationals (other than
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of the Irish
Republic), some patients detained under
mental health legislation, sentenced prisoners
and people convicted within the previous five
years of corrupt or illegal election practices.
Members of the armed forces, Crown servants
and staff of the British Council employed
overseas (together with their wives or
husbands if accompanying them) may be
40
GOVERNMENT
registered for an address in the constituency
where they would live but for their service.
British citizens living abroad may apply to
register as electors for a period of up to 20
years after they have left the UK.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors who
cannot reasonably be expected to vote in
person at their local polling station on polling
day—for example, electors away on holiday—
may apply for an absent vote at a particular
election. Electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person
because of the nature of their work or because
they have moved to a new area may apply for
an indefinite absent vote. People entitled to an
absent vote may vote by post or by proxy,
although postal ballot papers cannot be sent to
addresses outside the UK.
Voting is not compulsory; 71.5% of a total
electorate of 44.2 million people voted in the
General Election in May 1997. The simple
majority system of voting is used. Candidates
are elected if they have more votes than any of
the other candidates (although not necessarily
an absolute majority over all other candidates).
The Government proposes to hold a
referendum on the voting system for the
House of Commons. The Independent
Commission on the Voting System was set up
in 1997 to identify an alternative to the present
‘first-past-the-post’ system for Westminster.
The Commission is expected to report by the
end of 1998. A Ministerial Working Group
has been set up to examine a number of
aspects of electoral law and practice, with the
aim of modernising electoral procedures.
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, and of the Irish
Republic, may stand for election as MPs
provided they are aged 21 or over and are not
disqualified. Those disqualified include
undischarged bankrupts; people who have
been sentenced to more than one year’s
imprisonment; clergy of the Church of
England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers;
and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975.
A candidate’s nomination for election must
be proposed and seconded by two electors
registered as voters in the constituency and
signed by eight other electors. Candidates do
not have to be backed by a political party. A
candidate must also deposit £500, which is
returned if he or she receives 5% or more of
the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend
on a general election campaign is £4,965 plus
4.2 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 5.6 pence for each elector in a
county constituency. Higher limits have been
set for by-elections to reflect the fact that they
are often regarded as tests of national opinion
in the period between General Elections. The
maximum sum is £19,863 plus 16.9 pence for
each elector in borough seats, and 22.2 pence
for each elector in county seats. A candidate
may post an election communication to each
elector in the constituency, free of charge. All
election expenses, apart from the candidate’s
personal expenses, are subject to the statutory
maximum.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is an
essential element in the working of the
constitution. The present system depends
upon the existence of organised political
parties, each of which presents its policies to
the electorate for approval; in practice most
candidates in elections, and almost all winning
candidates, belong to one of the main parties.
A system of voluntary registration for political
parties was introduced in 1998. Registration is
necessary for the new proportional
representation electoral systems which involve
‘lists’ of candidates, being introduced for the
Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly
for Wales and the European Parliament.
Registration will help prevent the use of
misleading candidates’ descriptions on ballot
papers at election as only candidates
representing a registered or political party will
be able to have the name and emblem of the
party printed on the ballot paper.
41
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
For the last 150 years a predominantly two-
party system has existed. Since 1945 either the
Conservative Party, whose origins go back to
the 18th century, or the Labour Party, which
emerged in the last decade of the 19th century,
has held power. A new party—the Liberal
Democrats—was formed in 1988 when the
Liberal Party, which traced its origins to the
18th century, merged with the Social
Democratic Party, formed in 1981. Other
parties include two nationalist parties, Plaid
Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the
Scottish National Party (founded in 1934).
Northern Ireland has a number of parties.
They include the Ulster Unionist Party,
formed in the early part of this century; the
Democratic Unionist Party, founded in 1971
by a group which broke away from the Ulster
Unionists; Social Democratic and Labour
Party, founded in 1970; and Sinn Fein.8
Since 1945 eight General Elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and seven
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties.
The General Election of 1 May 1997
The May 1997 General Election was notable
in a number of ways:
• The Labour Party’s 13.5 million votes
were exceeded only in 1951, and the
party’s share of 43.2% of the vote was its
highest since 1966. The 418 seats won
were the party’s largest number ever, and
compare with 393 won in 1945.
• The Conservative Party’s 9.6 million
votes were its fewest since 1929, and its
share of 30.7% of the vote, the lowest
since 1832. The 165 seats won were its
smallest number since 1906. The
Conservatives won no seats in Scotland,
Wales or Northern Ireland.
• The Liberal Democrats’ 5.2 million votes
were fewer than in 1992, as was the
party’s share of the total vote, but the 46
seats won represented the party’s highest
8 Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA.
number since 1929, when it won 59 as the
Liberal Party.
• Turnout at the election was relatively
low, at 71.5%—the lowest national level
of turnout since 1935.
• A record number of women were elected
in 1997. In all 120 women MPs were
returned, double the number in 1992. Of
the new women MPs, 101 were Labour,
13 Conservative, 3 Liberal Democrat,
two SNP and one was the Speaker.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a General
Election, or which has the support of a majority
of members in the House of Commons, usually
forms the Government. By tradition, the leader
of the majority party is asked by the Sovereign
to form a government. About 100 of its
members in the Commons and the Lords
receive ministerial appointments (including to
the Cabinet—see p. 52) on the advice of the
Prime Minister. The largest minority party
becomes the official Opposition, with its own
leader and ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons with
their supporters (the backbenchers) sitting
behind them. Similar arrangements for the
parties apply to the House of Lords; however,
a significant number of Lords do not wish to
be associated with any political party, and sit
on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths of
the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however, its
aims are to contribute to the formulation of
policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
to Government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances of
winning the next General Election.

The detailed arrangements of government
business are settled, under the direction of the
Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two
Houses, by the Government Chief Whips of
each House in consultation with the
Opposition Chief Whips. The Chief Whips
together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often
referred to when the question of finding time
for a particular item of business is discussed.
The Leaders of the two Houses are
responsible for enabling the Houses to debate
matters about which they are concerned.
Parliamentary party control is exercised by
the Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party (usually by the
Leader). Their duties include keeping
members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of backbench
members. Party discipline tends to be less
strong in the Lords than in the Commons,
since Lords have less hope of high office and
no need of party support in elections.
Financial Assistance to Parties
Annual assistance from public funds helps
opposition parties carry out parliamentary
43
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
work at Westminster. In the Commons it is
limited to parties with at least two members
elected at the previous General Election or
one member elected and a minimum of
150,000 votes cast. The amount for the period
1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999 is £3,648.35
for every seat won at the 1997 General
Election, plus £7.04 for every 200 votes.
Financial assistance has been provided to
the two main opposition parties in the House
of Lords since 1 October 1996. For the
period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999 the
Conservative Party will receive £106,191 and
the Liberal Democrats £31,857.
The Government intends to introduce
legislation to ban overseas donations to
political parties and to require the declaration
of donations over £5,000. In response to a
request from the Committee on Standards in
Public Life (see p. 56), it has agreed to defer
legislation until after the Committee has
completed its report on the funding of
political parties (see p. 56).
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent, partly codified by each House
in its Standing Orders. The system of debate
is similar in both Houses. Every subject starts
off as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member.
After debate, in which each member (except
the mover of the motion) may speak only once,
the motion may be withdrawn: if it is not, the
Speaker or Chairman ‘puts the question’
whether to agree with the motion or not. The
question may be decided without voting, or by
a simple majority vote. The main difference of
procedure between the two Houses is that the
Speaker or Chairman in the Lords has no
powers of order; instead such matters are
decided by the general feeling of the House,
which is sometimes interpreted by the Leader
of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House and
must guard against the abuse of procedure and
protect minority rights. The Speaker has
discretion on whether to allow a motion to end
discussion so that a matter may be put to the
vote, and has powers to stop irrelevance and
repetition in debate. In cases of grave disorder
the Speaker can adjourn or suspend the
sitting. The Speaker may order members who
have broken the rules of behaviour of the
House to leave the Chamber or can initiate
their suspension for a number of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In a
tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
without expressing an opinion on the merits of
the question. Voting procedure in the House
of Lords is broadly similar, although the Lord
Chancellor may vote but does not have a
casting vote.
Modernisation of the House of Commons
A Select Committee on Modernisation of the
House of Commons was set up in June 1997 to
consider how its practices and procedures
should be modernised. Its First Report, on the
legislative process, called for greater flexibility
in the way legislation is handled. The report,
which has been agreed by the House,
proposed that a number of Bills should be
programmed on an experimental basis, and
suggested that it should be possible in defined
circumstances to carry forward Bills from one
session to the next. The Committee is now
looking at other issues, including the structure
of the parliamentary year, the process for
scrutinising European legislative proposals,
and the ability of MPs to make the
Government accountable for its actions.
Measures to modernise debating procedures
were approved in the Commons in June 1998.
These include abolishing the preference given
to Privy Counsellors’ speeches in debates and
the rule preventing MPs from quoting from
speeches made in the Lords.
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial (and some non-fmancial) interests.
Members with a financial interest must
declare it when speaking in the House or in
Committee and must indicate it when giving
notice of a question or motion. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings with
other members, ministers or civil servants,
MPs must also disclose any relevant financial
interest. MPs cannot advocate matters in the
44
GOVERNMENT
House which are related to the source of any
personal financial interest.
The House of Lords also has a Register of
Interests, on lines similar to that for MPs. It,
too, is open to public inspection.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards was created in 1995, following
recommendations of the Committee on
Standards in Public Life (see p. 56). The
Commissioner, who is independent of
government, can advise MPs on matters of
standards, and conduct a preliminary
investigation into complaints about alleged
breaches of the rules by Members. The
Commissioner reports to the House of
Commons Select Committee on Standards
and Privileges.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches (transcribed
verbatim in Hansard, the Official Report) are
published daily. The records of the Lords
from 1497 and of the Commons from 1547,
together with the parliamentary and political
papers of a number of former members of
both Houses, are available to the public
through the House of Lords Record Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television and
radio, either live or, more usually, in recorded
or edited form. Complete coverage is available
on cable television.
The Law-making Process
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament and
delegated legislation made by ministers under
powers given to them by Act (see p. 47).
While the interpretation of the law undergoes
constant refinement in the courts (see p. 212),
changes to statute law are made by Parliament.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Proposals for legislation affecting the
powers of particular bodies (such as individual
local authorities) or the rights of individuals
(such as certain proposals relating to railways,
roads and harbours) are known as Private
Bills, and are subject to a special form of
parliamentary procedure. Bills which change
the general law and which constitute the more
significant part of the parliamentary legislative
process are Public Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either
House, by a government minister or by an
ordinary (‘private’ or ‘backbench’) member (or
peer). Most public Bills that become Acts of
Parliament are introduced by a government
minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’.
Bills introduced by other MPs or Lords are
known as ‘Private Members’ Bills’.
The main Bills which constitute the
Government’s legislative programme are
announced in the Queen’s Speech at the State
Opening of Parliament, which usually takes
place in November, and the Bills themselves
are introduced into one or other of the Houses
over the succeeding weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and other agencies
interested in the subject, and with interest and
pressure groups seeking to promote specific
causes. ‘White Papers’, which are government
statements of policy, often contain proposals
for legislative changes; these may be debated
in Parliament before a Bill is introduced.
From time to time consultation papers,
sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, set out
government proposals which are still taking
shape and seek comments from the public.
Passage of Public Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Bills relating mainly to financial
matters are almost invariably introduced in the
Commons. Under the provisions of the
Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of
the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are very
restricted. The Parliament Acts also provide
for a Bill to be passed by the Commons
without consent of the Lords in certain (very
rare) circumstances.
The process of passing a Public Bill is
similar in each House. On presentation the
Bill is considered, without debate, to have
been read for a first time and is printed. After
an interval, of between one day and several
45
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
weeks, a Government Bill will receive its
second reading debate, during which the
general principles of the Bill are discussed.
If it obtains a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill will normally be committed
to a standing committee (see p. 47) for
detailed examination and amendment. In the
Lords, the committee stage usually takes
place on the floor of the House, and this
procedure may also be followed in the
Commons if that House so decides (usually in
cases where there is a need to pass the Bill
quickly or where it raises matters of
constitutional importance).
The committee stage is followed by the
report stage (‘consideration’) on the floor of
the House, during which further amendments
may be made. In the Commons, the report
stage is usually followed immediately by the
third reading debate, where the Bill is
reviewed in its final form. In the Lords, the
third reading debate usually takes place on a
different day: a Bill may be further amended
at third reading.
After passing its third reading in one
House, a Bill is sent to the other House, where
it passes through all its stages once more and
where it is, more often than not, further
amended. Amendments made by the second
House must be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can go for
Royal Assent.
In the Commons the House may vote to
limit the time available for consideration of a
Bill. This is done by passing a ‘timetable’
motion proposed by the Government,
commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. There
are special procedures for Public Bills which
consolidate existing legislation or which enact
private legislation relating to Scotland.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and known as an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been
refused since 1707. In the 1996—97 session 58
Public Bills were enacted. (A list of the main
Public Bills receiving Royal Assent since
autumn 1997 is given on pp. 540-1.)
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
Most Government Bills introduced and
passed in the Lords go through the Commons
without difficulty, but a Lords Bill which was
unacceptable to the Commons would not
become law. The Lords, on the other hand, do
not generally prevent Bills insisted upon by
the Commons from becoming law, though
they will often amend them and return them
to the Commons for further consideration.
By convention, the Lords pass Bills
authorising taxation or national expenditure
without amendment. A Bill that deals only
with taxation or expenditure must become law
within one month of being sent to the Lords,
whether or not the Lords agree to it, unless
the Commons directs otherwise. If no
agreement is reached between the two Houses
on a non-financial Commons Bill, the Lords
can delay the Bill for a period which, in
practice, amounts to at least 13 months.
Following this the Bill may be submitted to
the Queen for Royal Assent, provided it has
been passed a second time by the Commons.
There is one important exception: any Bill to
lengthen the life of a Parliament requires the
full assent of both Houses.
These limits are based on the belief that
nowadays the main legislative function of the
non-elected House is to act as a chamber of
revision, complementing but not rivalling the
elected House.
Private Members’ Bills
Early in each session backbench members of
the Commons ballot (draw lots) for the
opportunity to introduce a Bill on one of the
Fridays during the session when such Bills
have precedence over government business.
The first 20 members whose names are drawn
win this privilege, but it does not guarantee
that their Bills will pass into law. Members
may also present a Bill on any day without
debate, while on most Tuesdays and
Wednesdays on which the Commons is sitting
there is also an opportunity to seek leave to
present a Bill under the ‘ten minute rule’.
This provides an opportunity for a brief
speech by the member proposing the Bill (and
by one who opposes it).
46
GOVERNMENT
Few of these Bills make further progress or
receive any debate, but in most sessions some
do become law (22 in the 1996—97 session).
Recent examples include the Confiscation of
Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 and the
Community Care (Residential
Accommodation) Act 1998. Private Members’
Bills do not often call for the expenditure of
public money; but if they do they cannot
proceed to committee stage unless the
Government decides to provide the necessary
money. Peers may introduce Private
Members’ Bills in the House of Lords at any
time. A Private Member’s Bill passed by one
House will not proceed in the other unless
taken up by a member of that House.
Private and Hybrid Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to Public
Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. Hybrid Bills are Public Bills
which may affect private rights, for example,
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill, which was
passed in 1996. As with Private Bills, the
passage of Hybrid Bills through Parliament is
governed by special procedures which allow
those affected to put their case.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation often
gives ministers or other authorities the power
to regulate administrative details by means of
secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation (usually in
the form of‘statutory instruments’). To
minimise any risk that delegating powers to
the executive might undermine the authority
of Parliament, such powers are normally
delegated only to authorities directly
accountable to Parliament. Moreover, Acts of
Parliament which delegate such powers
usually provide for some measure of direct
parliamentary control over proposed delegated
legislation, by giving Parliament the
opportunity to affirm or annul it. Certain Acts
also require that organisations affected must
be consulted before rules and orders can be
made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House as a whole. In the Lords, debates on
statutory instruments take place on the floor
of the House. The House of Lords has
appointed a delegated powers scrutiny
committee which examines the
appropriateness of the powers to make
secondary legislation in Bills.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a Committee of the Whole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or Lord may
speak once only on each motion does not apply
in committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider Public Bills at the
committee stage. The committee considers the
Bill clause by clause, and may amend it before
reporting it back to the House. Ordinary
standing committees do not have names but
are referred to simply as Standing Committee
A, B, C, and so on; a new set of members is
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
committee has between 16 and 50 members,
with a party balance reflecting as far as
possible that in the House as a whole. The
standing committees include two Scottish
standing committees, and the Scottish, Welsh
and Northern Ireland Grand Committees.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish MPs (and may be convened
anywhere in Scotland as well as at
Westminster). It may consider the principle of
any Scottish Bill at the second and third reading
stages, where such a Bill has been referred to the
Committee by the House for that purpose. It
47
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
also debates other matters concerning Scotland.
In addition, its business includes questions
tabled for oral answer, ministerial statements
and other debates, including those on statutory
instruments referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, consisting
of all 40 Welsh MPs and up to five others who
may be added from time to time, considers
Bills referred to it at second reading stage,
questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements, and other matters relating
exclusively to Wales.
The Northern Ireland Grand Committee
considers Bills at the second and third stages,
takes oral questions and ministerial
statements, and debates matters relating
specifically to Northern Ireland. It includes all
18 Northern Ireland MPs and up to 25 others
who may be added from time to time.
The House of Commons will consider
whether the Grand Committees, and the
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Select
Committees (see below) should have a continuing
role at Westminster following the establishment
of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and
Northern Ireland National Assemblies.
There is a Standing Committee on
Regional Affairs, consisting of all Members
sitting for constituencies in England, plus up
to 5 others. But it has not met since 1977.
There are also standing committees to
debate proposed European legislation, and to
scrutinise statutory instruments and draft
statutory instruments brought forward by the
Government.
In the Lords, various sorts of committees
on Bills may be used instead of, or as well as, a
Committee of the Whole House. Such
committees include Public Bill Committees,
Special Public Bill Committees, Grand
Committees, Select Committees and Scottish
Select Committees.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed for a
particular task, generally one of inquiry,
investigation and scrutiny. They report their
conclusions and recommendations to the
House as a whole; in many cases their
recommendations invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the
House. A select committee may be appointed
for a Parliament, or for a session, or for as long
as it takes to complete its task. To help
Parliament with the control of the executive by
examining aspects of public policy, expenditure
and administration, 16 committees, established
by the House of Commons, examine the work
of the main government departments and their
associated public bodies. The Foreign Affairs
Select Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the
work of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office.
A new committee—the Environmental Audit
Committee—was set up in 1997 (see p. 313).
The committees are constituted on a basis
which is in approximate proportion to party
strength in the House.
Other regular Commons select committees
include those on Public Accounts, Standards
and Privileges, and European Legislation.
‘Domestic’ select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
Each House has a select committee to keep it
informed of European Union (EU)
developments, and to enable it to scrutinise and
debate Union policies and proposals, while two
Commons standing committees debate specific
European legislative proposals. Ministers also
make regular statements about EU business.
In their examination of government
policies, expenditure and administration,
committees may question ministers, civil
servants and interested bodies and individuals.
Through hearings and published reports, they
bring before Parliament and the public an
extensive body of fact and informed opinion
on many issues, and build up considerable
expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees: on the
European Community and on Science and
Technology. Ad hoc committees may also be
set up to consider particular issues (or,
sometimes, a particular Bill), and ‘domestic’
committees—as in the Commons—cover the
internal workings of the House.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
48
GOVERNMENT
session to deal with Consolidation Bills9 and
statutory instruments (see p. 47). The two
Houses may also agree to set up joint select
committees on other subjects.
Unofficial Party Committees
The Parliamentary Labour Party comprises all
members of the party in both Houses. When
the Labour Party is in office, a parliamentary
committee, half of whose members are
elected and half of whom are government
representatives, acts as a channel of
communication between the Government and
its backbenchers in both Houses. When the
party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the direction
of an elected parliamentary committee, which
acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in the
House of Commons. When the party is in
office, ministers attend its meetings by
invitation and not by right. When it is in
opposition, the whole membership of the
party may attend meetings. The leader
appoints a consultative committee, which acts
as the party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
In addition to the system of scrutiny by select
committees, both Houses offer a number of
opportunities for the examination of
government policy by both the Opposition and
the Government’s own backbenchers. In the
House of Commons, the opportunities include:
1. Question Time, when for 55 minutes on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,
ministers answer MPs’ questions. The Prime
Minister’s Question Time takes place for one
half hour every Wednesday when the House is
sitting. Parliamentary questions are one means
of seeking information about the
Government’s intentions. They are also a way
of raising grievances brought to MPs’ notice
9 A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts
into one, with the aim of simplifying the statutes.
by constituents. MPs may also put questions
to ministers for written answer; the questions
and answers are published in Hansard. There
are some 50,000 questions every year.
2. Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the House to
raise constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment
period at the end of the business of the day,
and opportunities for several adjournment
debates on Wednesday mornings. In addition,
an MP wishing to discuss a ‘specific and
important matter that should have urgent
consideration’ may, at the end of Question
Time, seek leave to move the adjournment of
the House. On the very few occasions when
leave is obtained, the matter is debated for
three hours in what is known as an emergency
debate, usually on the following day.
3. Early day motions (EDMs) provide a
further opportunity for backbench MPs to
express their views on particular issues. A
number of EDMs are tabled each sitting day;
they are very rarely debated but can be useful
in gauging the degree of support for the topic
by the number of signatures of other MPs
which the motion attracts.
4. The 20 Opposition days each session, when
the Opposition can choose subjects for debate.
Of these days, 17 are at the disposal of the
Leader of the Opposition and three at the
disposal of the second largest opposition party.
5. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government expenditure,
chosen by the Liaison Committee (a select
committee largely made up of select
committee chairmen, which considers general
matters relating to the work of select
committees). Procedural opportunities for
criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the Queen’s Speech at the
beginning of each session; during debates on
motions of censure for which the Government
provides time; and during debates on the
Government’s legislative and other proposals.
Similar opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
Question Time, during debates and by means
of questions for written answer.
49
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons, in
overseeing the revenue of the State and public
expenditure, are to authorise the raising of taxes
and duties, and the various objects of
expenditure and the sum to be spent on each.
Parliament also has to satisfy itself that the sums
granted are spent only for the purposes which it
intended. No payment out of the central
government’s public funds can be made, and no
taxation or loans authorised, except by Act of
Parliament. However, limited interim payments
can be made from the Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important of
the annual statutes, and authorises the raising
of revenue. The legislation is based on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement. This includes a review of the public
finances of the previous year, and proposals
for future expenditure (see p. 388). Scrutiny
of public expenditure is carried out by House
of Commons select committees (see p. 47).
Forcing the Government to Resign
The Final control is the ability of the House of
Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of‘no confidence’. The
Government must also resign if the House
rejects a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has
declared it a ‘matter of confidence’ or if the
House refuses to vote the money required for
the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Ombudsman—officially
known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—-investigates complaints from
members of the public (referred through MPs)
alleging that they have suffered injustice
arising from maladministration. The
Ombudsman is independent of government
and reports to a Select Committee of the
House of Commons. The Ombudsman’s
jurisdiction covers central government
departments and agencies and a large number
of non-departmental public bodies. He or she
cannot investigate complaints about
government policy, the content of legislation
or relations with other countries.
In making investigations, the
Commissioner has access to all departmental
papers, and has powers to summon those from
whom he wishes to take evidence. When an
investigation is completed, he sends a report
with his findings to the MP who referred the
complaint (with a copy report for the
complainant). When a complaint is justified,
the Ombudsman normally recommends that
the department provides redress (which can
include a financial remedy for the complainant
in appropriate cases). There is no appeal
against the Ombudsman’s decision. He
submits an annual report to Parliament, and
publishes selected cases three times a year.
The Ombudsman received 1,459 new
complaints in 1997—98 (a decrease of 21%
over the previous year). He completed 376
investigations. Complaints against the
Department of Social Security accounted for
56% of the total received.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman also
monitors the Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information (see p. 55).
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from obstruction
in carrying out its duties. The rights apply
collectively to each House and to its staff and
individually to each member. They include
freedom of speech; first call on the attendance
of its members, who are therefore free from
arrest in civil actions and exempt from serving
on juries, or being compelled to attend court
as witnesses; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the rights of
the House to control its own proceedings (so
that it is able, for instance, to exclude
‘strangers’10 if it wishes); to decide upon legal
disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to
punish for breach of its privileges and for
contempt. Parliament has the right to punish
10 All those who are not members or officials of either House.
50
GOVERNMENT
anybody, inside or outside the House, who
commits a breach of privilege—that is, offends
against the rights of the House.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the Commons. The
law of privilege is being examined by a Joint
Committee of both Houses of Parliament, which
is expected to report before the end of 1998.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the conduct of
national affairs. The Prime Minister is
appointed by the Queen, and all other
ministers are appointed by the Queen on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister. Most
ministers are members of the Commons,
although the Government is also fully
represented by ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First
Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The Prime Minister’s unique
position of authority derives from majority
support in the House of Commons and from
the power to appoint and dismiss ministers.
By modern convention, the Prime Minister
always sits in the Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet (see p. 52), is responsible for
allocating functions among ministers and
informs the Queen at regular meetings of the
general business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
Church of England archbishops, bishops and
deans and some 200 other clergy in Crown
‘livings’; senior judges, such as the Lord Chief
Justice; Privy Counsellors; and Lord-
Lieutenants. He or she also recommends
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable
of the Tower, and some university posts; and
appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the BBC (British
Broadcasting Corporation), as well as various
royal and statutory commissions.
Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (to people who have
achieved eminence in science or the arts and
are in financial need). The Prime Minister also
chooses the trustees of certain national
museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10
Downing Street (the official residence in
London) is staffed by civil servants. The
Prime Minister may also appoint special
advisers to the Office to assist in the formation
of policies (see p. 57).
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’,
or may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the President of the Council, the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General and,
from time to time, Ministers without Portfolio,
may have few or no departmental duties. They
are thus available to perform any duties the
Prime Minister may wish to give them. In the
present administration, for example, the
President of the Council is Leader of the House
of Commons and the Chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster is Minister of the Public Service.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a minister with departmental functions
and the head of the judiciary (see p. 221). The
51
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
four Law Officers of the Crown are: for
England and Wales, the Attorney General and
the Solicitor General; and for Scotland, the
Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for
Scotland.
Ministers of State and Junior Ministers
Ministers of State usually work with ministers
in charge of departments. They normally have
specific responsibilities, and are sometimes
given titles which reflect these functions, for
example, ‘Minister for School Standards’,
‘Minister for Welfare Reform’, ‘Minister of
Transport’. A Minister of State may be given
a seat in the Cabinet and be paid accordingly.
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State or, where the
senior minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries) also have
both parliamentary and departmental duties.
They may be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work.
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons (from April 1998) range from
£24,273 a year for junior ministers to £61,650
for Cabinet ministers. In the House of Lords
salaries range from £44,832 for junior
ministers to £80,107 for Cabinet ministers.
The Prime Minister is entitled to a salary of
£102,750.11 The Lord Chancellor receives
£151,002 (from December 1998).
In addition to their ministerial salaries,
ministers in the Commons, including the
Prime Minister, receive a full parliamentary
salary of £45,066 a year in recognition of their
constituency responsibilities and can claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs.
The Leader of the Opposition in the
Commons receives a salary of £56,513 (and
also the full parliamentary salary of £45,066);
two Opposition whips in the Commons and
11 The Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues have
declined the full salary they are entitled to; the Prime
Minister draws instead a salary of £60,167, while Cabinet
Ministers in the Commons draw £40,210 and in the Lords
£60,495.
the Opposition Leader and Chief Whip in the
Lords also receive salaries.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by the
Prime Minister and may include departmental
and non-departmental ministers.
The functions of the Cabinet are to initiate
and decide on policy, the supreme control of
government and the co-ordination of
government departments. The exercise of
these functions is vitally affected by the fact
that the Cabinet is a group of party
representatives, depending upon majority
support in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential. Its members are
bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not
to disclose information about its proceedings,
although after 30 years Cabinet papers may be
made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours
each week during parliamentary sittings, and
less often when Parliament is not sitting. A
great deal of work is carried on through the
committee system in order to keep its
workload within manageable limits, This
involves referring issues either to a standing
Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc committee
of the ministers directly concerned. The
committee then considers the matter in detail
and either disposes of it or reports upon it to
the Cabinet with recommendations for action.
There are standing committees dealing
with defence and overseas policy, economic
policy, home and social affairs, the
environment, and local government. Two new
committees have been set up since the election
of the present Government in May 1997: on
devolution to Scotland and Wales and the
English regions; and on constitutional reform
policy. The latter committee became the first
to involve members who are not from the
governing party, when members of the Liberal
Democrats were invited to serve on it.
52
GOVERNMENT
The membership and terms of reference of
all ministerial Cabinet committees are
published. Where appropriate, the Secretary
of the Cabinet and other senior officials of the
Cabinet Office attend meetings of the Cabinet
and its committees.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office is the central department
of the UK government.
The Secretary of the Cabinet (a civil
servant) is also Head of the Home Civil
Service. He manages the Cabinet Secretariats,
which serve ministers collectively in the
conduct of Cabinet business, and in the co¬
ordination of policy at the highest level. He
reports directly to the Prime Minister.
The Minister for the Cabinet Office, who is
a member of the Cabinet, is also the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He has
ministerial responsibility for all parts of the
Cabinet Office, except the Cabinet
Secretariats, and is supported by the
Permanent Secretary at the Cabinet Office ( a
civil servant).
The Cabinet is responsible for:
• modernising and simplifying
Government so that it works more
effectively for the benefit of the people;
• implementing a government programme
to improve the accessibility and quality of
public services to citizen and business;
• providing the central strategic
management of the Civil Service.
The Historical Section is responsible for
the Official Histories of the UK.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that all ministers unanimously support
government policy once it has been settled. The
policy of departmental ministers must be
consistent with the policy of the Government as
a whole. Once the Government’s policy on a
matter has been decided, each minister is
expected to support it or resign. On rare
occasions, ministers have been allowed free
votes in Parliament on government policies
involving important issues of principle. In June
1997, for example, free votes were allowed on
prohibiting the private ownership of handguns,
and in June 1998 on lowering the age of consent
to homosexual sex from 18 to 16.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their departments means that
they have a duty to Parliament to account, and
to be held to account, for the policies,
decisions and actions of their departments.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
on important political matters they usually
consult their colleagues collectively, either
through the Cabinet or through a Cabinet
committee. A decision by a departmental
minister binds the Government as a whole.
On assuming office ministers must resign
company directorships and ensure that there is
no conflict between their public duties and
private interests.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies,
staffed by politically impartial civil servants, are
the main instruments for implementing
government policy when Parliament has passed
the necessary legislation, and for advising
ministers. They often work alongside local
authorities, statutory boards, and government-
sponsored organisations operating under
various degrees of government control.
A change of government does not
necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments,
although major changes in policy may be
accompanied by organisational changes.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers the
UK as a whole. Other departments, such as
the Department of Social Security, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others again, such as the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions, are mainly concerned with
affairs in England.
53
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The ten Government Offices for the
Regions, in England, are responsible for
administering the main regional programmes of
the Departments of Environment, Transport
and the Regions, Trade and Industry, and
Education and Employment, as well as
programmes from the Home Office (see p. 7).
Some departments which have direct
contact with the public throughout the
country also have local offices.
Departments are usually headed by
ministers. In some, the head is a permanent
official, and ministers with other duties are
responsible for them to Parliament. For
instance, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is
responsible for the Treasury, HM Customs
and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the Office for
National Statistics and a number of other
departments, as well as executive agencies
such as the Royal Mint. Departments
generally receive their funds directly out of
money provided by Parliament and are staffed
by civil servants.
The functions of the main government
departments and agencies are set out in
Appendix 1, pp. 532-40.
Non-departmental Public Bodies
Non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs)
have a role in the process of national
government but are neither government
departments nor parts of a department. There
are three main kinds: executive bodies,
advisory bodies and tribunals. Tribunals are a
specialised group of bodies whose functions
are essentially quasi-judicial (see p. 227).
The continuing need for each NDPB is
regularly reviewed in a continuous programme.
When no longer needed in their existing form,
the bodies are abolished, merged or privatised.
The overall number of NDPBs decreased from
1,643 in 1987 to 1,128 in 1997.
New measures to make NDPBs more open,
accountable and effective were announced in
June 1998. They include opening up public
appointments by widening the field of
candidates, and increasing the representation of
women and members of ethnic minorities. All
government departments will be required to set
targets to reach a 50:50 split between men and
women for public appointments and a
proportionate representation of the ethnic
minorities.
Ministerial appointments to executive
NDPBs are subject to the Commissioner for
Public Appointments’ Code of Practice (see p.
57). In October 1998 the Commissioner’s remit
was extended to cover the utility regulators,
boards of nationalised industries and public
corporations, and with a ‘lighter touch’ to
advisory NDPBs.
Executive Bodies
Executive bodies are public organisations with
executive, administrative, regulatory or
commercial functions. They are normally set
up in statute, and operate within broad policy
guidelines set by departmental ministers but
are in varying degrees independent of
government in carrying out their day-to-day
responsibilities. They normally employ their
own staff and are responsible for their own
budget. Examples include the Commission for
Racial Equality and the Police Complaints
Authority.
Advisory Bodies
Many government departments are assisted by
advisory councils or committees carrying out
research and collecting information, mainly to
give ministers access to informed opinion
before they come to a decision involving a
legislative or executive act. In some cases a
minister must consult a standing committee,
but advisory bodies are usually set up at the
discretion of the minister. Examples include
the British Overseas Trade Board and the
Farm Animal Welfare Council. Membership
varies according to the nature of the work
involved, but often includes representatives of
the relevant interests and professions.
For some particularly important issues,
Royal Commissions, whose members are
chosen for their wide experience, may be
appointed. Royal Commissions examine
evidence from government departments,
interested organisations and individuals, and
submit recommendations; some prepare
regular reports. One example is the standing
Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, set up in 1970.
54
GOVERNMENT
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister’s Press Office have
direct contact with the parliamentary press
through regular meetings with the Lobby
correspondents. The Lobby correspondents
are a group of political correspondents with
the special privilege of access to the Lobby of
the House of Commons, where they can talk
privately to government ministers and other
members of the House. The Prime Minister’s
Press Office is the accepted channel through
which information about parliamentary
business is passed to the media.
Better Government
Programme
The Government intends to publish a White
Paper setting out its programme of work for
‘Better Government’. This will focus on how
all parts of government can work better
together to tackle the issues that cut across
organisational boundaries. The Paper will also
set out how the Government intends to make
government services and information more
accessible, effective and easy for the citizen to
use, in particular by the use of new
technology.
Open Government
The Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information was introduced in
1994. It commits government departments,
agencies and executive public bodies within
the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary
Ombudsman to volunteer information, such as
facts and analysis behind policy decisions, and
to answer requests for information.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman (see p. 50)
offers an independent appeals mechanism for
those seeking information under the Code
who are dissatisfied with the response to their
inquiry and with the results of any internal
review of the original decision. Complaints to
the Parliamentary Ombudsman must be
referred through an MP.
Freedom of Information
As part of its programme of constitutional
reform, the Government intends to replace
the non-statutory Code of Practice with a
Freedom of Information Act. A White Paper
setting out the Government’s proposals was
published in December 1997 and a draft Bill
will be published in late 1998.
In the meantime, departments, agencies
and other public bodies covered by the Code
of Practice have been encouraged to be as open
as possible. Examples of open government in
practice during 1997 include:
• publication by the Ministry of Defence of
advice to ministers between 1994 and
1996 on organophosphate pesticide use
during the Gulf War; and
• publication by the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office in July 1998 of
the criteria to be used in considering
licence applications for the export of
conventional arms.
Independent National Statistical Service
A further element in the government
programme of constitutional reform is the
creation of an independent national statistical
service. A Green Paper was published in
February 1998 (see Further Reading) with the
intention of opening up debate on the best
arrangements for ensuring high quality
statistics, driven by the requirements of all
users, efficiently produced, and compiled and
presented free from political interference.
Service First: the New Charter Programme
In June 1998, following a wide-ranging
review, the Government launched Service
First, the successor to the Citizen’s Charter, as
part of its Better Government agenda. (The
Citizen’s Charter programme was launched in
1991 with the aim of raising the standard of
public services and making them more
responsive to their users. The original Charter
set out a number of key principles which users
of public services are entitled to expect.)
Service First is underpinned by nine
principles of public service delivery, which set
55
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
out what every public service should be
striving to achieve. They include: setting clear
standards of service; consultation with users; a
well-publicised and easy-to-use complaints
procedure; and closer working with other
providers to ensure services are simple to use,
co-ordinated, and deliver a better service.
Service First applies to all public services,
at both national and local level, and to those
privatised utilities retaining a monopoly
element. In support of the new programme, a
range of guides has been issued covering
issues such as drawing up a charter,
consultation, and complaints handling. Other
key elements of the programme include:
• The Charter Mark Award Scheme, which
rewards excellence in delivering public
services. Applicants have to demonstrate
that they have achieved measurable
improvements in the quality of services
over the previous two years, and that
their users are satisfied with their
services. Since 1992, over 4,800
organisations have applied for the
Charter Mark and a total of 1,139 have
been awarded. In 1997 there were 947
applications and a record 365 awards
were made. Over 1,200 organisations
have applied for the 1998 award, an
increase of 27% on the previous year.
• The People’s Panel, which consists of
5,000 members of the public randomly
selected from across the UK, to provide a
representative cross-section of the
population. Panel members are consulted
about how public services are delivered
and how delivery can be improved from
the point of view of the user; and
• Better Government for Older People, which
aims to improve public services for older
people by better meeting their needs,
listening to their views, and recognising
their contribution to society. Twenty-
eight local pilot schemes have been set up
across the UK to examine new ways of
delivering services. The schemes are
being led by local authorities, but bring
together organisations from central
government and the voluntary, private
and community sectors, as well as older
people themselves. The programme will
run for two years, and a guide based on
the experiences of the pilot schemes will
be published in April 2000.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
This Committee was set up in 1994 against a
background of increasing public concern
about standards in many areas of public life.
The Committee’s terms of reference are ‘to
examine current concerns about standards of
conduct of all holders of public office,
including arrangements relating to financial
and commercial activities, and make
recommendations as to any changes in present
arrangements which might be required to
ensure the highest standards of propriety in
public life’. The Committee’s first chairman
was Lord Nolan, who was succeeded in 1997
by Lord Neill of Bladen, QC.
The Committee has published five reports
(see Further Reading). The first, in 1995, was
about MPs, ministers and civil servants, and
NDPBs. This led to the appointment of a
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
(see p. 45) and a Commissioner for Public
Appointments (see below).
The Committee’s second report, in 1996,
examined standards of conduct in local public
spending bodies. The third report, in 1997,
considered aspects of conduct in local
government, and called for a radical change in
the ethical framework within which local
government operates. Its recommendations
included a proposal for a new statutory
criminal offence of misuse of public office. A
fourth report, published in November 1997,
reviewed progress on implementing
recommendations in earlier reports on
executive NDPBs, NHS Trusts and local
public spending bodies.
In November 1997 the Prime Minister gave
the Committee additional terms of reference
‘to review the funding of political parties and
to make recommendations as to any changes in
present arrangements’. The report is to be
published in late 1998.
Commissioner for Public Appointments
The Commissioner for Public Appointments,
appointed in response to the first report of the
56
GOVERNMENT
Standards in Public Life Committee (see
above), is independent of government. The
Commissioner is responsible for monitoring,
regulating and auditing approximately 16,000
ministerial appointments to a range of public
bodies including NDPBs, public corporations,
nationalised industries and NHS Trusts. The
Commissioner has issued a Code of Practice
which encompasses the six principles to be
applied to these appointments. He also issues
an annual report.
The Civil Service Commissioners
The Civil Service Commissioners are
responsible for upholding the fundamental
principle that selection to the Civil Service
should be solely on merit on the basis of fair
and open competition. The Commissioners,
who are independent of government, produce
a mandatory Recruitment Code and audit the
recruitment policies and practices of
departments and agencies to ensure
compliance. They are also responsible for
approving appointments through
external recruitment to the Senior Civil
Service, and for hearing and determining
appeals in cases of concern about propriety
and conscience under the Civil Service Code.
The Commissioners publish an annual report.
The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the
conduct of the whole range of government
activities as they affect the community. These
range from policy formulation to carrying out
the day-to-day duties of public administration.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown.
For all practical purposes the Crown in this
context means, and is represented by, the
Government of the day. In most
circumstances the executive powers of the
Crown are exercised by, and on the advice of,
Her Majesty’s ministers, who are in turn
answerable to Parliament. The Civil Service as
such has no constitutional personality or
responsibility separate from that of the
Government of the day. The duty of the
individual civil servant is first and foremost to
the minister of the Crown who is in charge of
the department in which he or she is serving.
A change of minister, for whatever reason,
does not involve a change of staff. Ministers
sometimes appoint special advisers from
outside the Civil Service. (There are about 70
such advisers in the present administration.)
The advisers are normally paid from public
funds, but their appointments end when the
Government’s term of office does, or when the
minister concerned leaves the Government or
moves to another appointment.
A new Civil Service code came into force in
1996. This provides a statement of the
constitutional framework within which all civil
servants work and the values they are expected
to uphold. The Code includes an independent
line of appeal to the Civil Service
Commissioners on alleged breaches of the
Code. The Government intends to give legal
force to the Code.
Civil servants constitute about 2% of the
working population in employment, and about
10% of all public sector employees. The
number of civil servants fell from 751,000 in
1976 to 463,300 in April 1998 (a decrease of
38%), the lowest since 1945. This reflects the
Government’s policy of controlling the cost of
the Civil Service and of improving its
efficiency. The above figures also include the
members of the Senior Civil Service, which
comprises around 3,000 of the most senior
managers and policy advisers.
About half of all civil servants are engaged
in providing services to the public. These
include paying benefits and pensions, issuing
driving licences, running employment
services, staffing prisons, and providing
services to industry and agriculture. A further
quarter are employed in the Ministry of
Defence. The rest are divided between central
administrative and policy duties; support
services; and largely financially self-
supporting services, for instance, those
provided by National Savings and the Royal
Mint. Four-fifths of civil servants work
outside London.
Northern Ireland Civil Service
The Northern Ireland Civil Service is
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain,
and has its own Civil Service Commission.
57
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Interchange of staff between the two Civil
Services occurs to a minor extent only.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 3,530 people, provides staff for the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office (see p. 93)
in London and at British diplomatic missions
abroad.
The Diplomatic Service has its own grade
structure, linked to that of the Home Civil
Service. Terms and conditions of service are
comparable, but take into account the special
demands of the Service, particularly the
requirement to serve abroad. Home civil
servants, members of the armed forces and
individuals from the private sector may also
serve in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office
and at overseas posts on loan or attachment.
Equality of Opportunity
The Government has stated its commitment
to achieving equality of opportunity for all its
staff. In support of this commitment, the Civil
Service, which recruits and promotes on the
basis of merit, is pursuing policies to develop
career opportunities for women, ethnic
minorities and people with disabilities. In
April 1997, the overall proportion of women
in the Civil Service was 51%; ethnic minority
representation was 5.7% compared with 5.3%
in the economically active population; and at
least 3.8% of staff employed were disabled.
However, women are still under-represented
at middle and senior management levels and
ethnic minority and disabled staff are still
predominantly concentrated in junior grades.
Progress is monitored and reported on
regularly by the Cabinet Office (OPS).
Central Management
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service is divided
between the Cabinet Office (OPS) and the
Treasury. The OPS, which is under the
control of the Prime Minister, as Minister for
the Civil Service, oversees organisation,
senior civil service pay, pensions and
allowances, recruitment, retirement and
redundancy policy, personnel management
and statistics, and the overall efficiency of the
Service. The function of official Head of the
Home Civil Service is combined with that of
Secretary of the Cabinet.
Executive Agencies: Next Steps
Programme
The Next Steps Programme, launched in
1988, aims to deliver government services
more efficiently and effectively within
available resources for the benefit of taxpayers,
customers and staff. This has involved setting
up, as far as is practicable, separate units or
agencies to perform the executive functions of
government. Agencies remain part of the Civil
Service, but under the terms of individual
framework documents they enjoy greater
delegation of financial, pay and personnel
matters. Agencies are headed by chief
executives who are normally directly
accountable to ministers but who are
personally responsible for day-to-day
operations. Chief executives’ pay is normally
directly related to their agency’s performance.
No organisation carrying out a government
function can become an agency until the ‘prior
options’ of abolition, privatisation and
contracting out have been considered and
ruled out. These ‘prior options’ are
reconsidered when agencies are reviewed,
normally after five years of operation.
By April 1998, 355,900 civil servants were
working in Agencies.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants are required to perform loyally
the duties assigned to them by the
Government of the day, whatever its political
persuasion. It is essential that ministers and
the public should have confidence that the
personal views of civil servants do not
influence the performance of their official
duties, given the role of the Civil Service in
serving successive governments formed by
different parties.
The aim of the rules which govern political
activities by civil servants is to allow them,
subject to these fundamental principles, the
58
GOVERNMENT
greatest possible freedom to take part in public
affairs consistent with their rights and duties
as citizens. The Civil Service is divided into
three groups—based on seniority—for the
purposes of deciding the extent to which
individuals may take part in political activities.
These are the ‘politically free’, ‘intermediate’
and ‘politically restricted’. Where required,
permission is granted to the maximum extent
consistent with the Civil Service’s reputation
for political impartiality and the avoidance of
any conflict with official duties.
Generally, there are no restrictions on the
private activities of civil servants, provided
that these do not bring discredit on the Civil
Service, and that there is no possibility of
conflict with official duties. For instance, a
civil servant must comply with any
departmental instruction on the need to seek
authority before taking part in any outside
activity which involves official experience.
The Office of the Advisory Committee on
Business Appointments handles applications
from Crown servants, including members of
the Diplomatic Service and the Armed Forces,
who wish take up business appointments
within two years of leaving Crown service.
The Committee also provides advice, under
published Guidelines, to former ministers on
accepting appointments within a similar
period after leaving office. The Committee
publishes an annual report.
Security
Each department is responsible for its own
internal security. As a general rule the
privately held political views of civil servants
are not a matter of official concern. However,
no one who is, or has been involved in, or
associated with, activities threatening national
security may be employed on work which is
vital to the security of the State. Certain posts
are not open to people who fall into this
category, or to anyone whose reliability may
be in doubt for any other reason.
The Security Commission may investigate
breaches of security in the public service and
advise on changes in security procedure if
asked to do so by the Prime Minister after
consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition.
Local Government
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities derive their power from
legislation. They can act only under powers
conferred on them by Acts of Parliament. If
these powers are exceeded, the local authority
concerned can be challenged in a court of law.
Local authorities’ functions are far-reaching.
Some are mandatory, which means that the
authority must do what is required by law;
others are purely permissive, allowing an
authority to provide services if it wishes. In
certain services, ministers have powers to
secure a degree of uniformity in standards in
order to safeguard public health or to protect
the rights of individual citizens.
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions. However, other departments,
such as the Department for Education and
Employment, the Department of Health and
the Home Office, are also concerned with
various local government functions. In the rest
of the UK at present the local authorities deal
mainly with The Scottish or Welsh Offices or
the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland as appropriate. (But see
pp. 15, 21 and 27 for planned transfer of
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices
responsibilities under the devolution
programme.)
Closer links between central and local
government in England have been promoted
through the Central-Local Partnership
Meeting, which brings together Cabinet
ministers and senior local government leaders
to discuss major issues affecting local
government.
In 1998 the Government ratified the
Council of Europe’s Charter of Local Self
Government. This lays down standards for
protecting and developing the rights of local
authorities.
Reform of Local Government Structure
A major reform of local government took place
in 1974 in England and Wales and in 1975 in
Scotland. This created two main tiers of local
59
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
authority throughout England and Wales:
counties and the smaller districts. Local
government in London had been reorganised
along the same lines in 1965. In Scotland
functions were allocated to regions and
districts on the mainland; single-tier
authorities were introduced for the three
Islands areas. In Northern Ireland changes
were made in 1973 which replaced the two-
tier county council and urban/rural council
system with single-tier district councils.
The Local Government Act 1985 abolished
the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils in England.
Most of their functions were transferred to the
London boroughs and metropolitan district
councils respectively in 1986 (see below).
Recent Changes
During the last six years a further
restructuring of local government has taken
place in non-metropolitan England and in
Scotland and Wales. In 1992 the Local
Government Commission was established to
review the structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England
and to undertake periodic electoral reviews. In
its structural reviews of local government in
non-metropolitan England, the Commission
considered whether the two-tier structure
should be replaced by single-tier (‘unitary’)
authorities in each area; for the most part it
recommended the retention of two-tier
government, but suggested unitary authorities
for some areas, especially the larger cities.
Parliament approved reorganisation in 25
counties, creating a total of 46 new unitary
councils (see map on p. 8). Implementation
was completed in April 1998.
In Scotland 29 new unitary councils
replaced the previous system of 9 regional and
53 district councils in April 1996; the 3 Islands
councils have remained in being. In Wales, 22
unitary authorities replaced the previous 8
county councils and 37 district councils, again
in April 1996.
In July 1998 the Government published
White Paper proposals for modernising local
government in England {Modern Local
Government: In Touch with the People) and
Wales {Local Voices: Modernising Local
Government in Wales). The White Papers
contain proposals for: creating new political
structures for councils (see p. 64); improving
local democracy (see p. 64); strengthening
local financial accountability; establishing a
new ethical framework; improving local
services through best value (see p. 63);
simplifying capital finance; and introducing
some local discretion in business rates.
Principal Types of Local Authority
Greater London
Greater London is divided into 32 boroughs
and the Corporation of the City of London,
each with a council responsible for all local
government services in its area. Exceptions
include public transport, responsibility for
which lies with London Transport (see p. 366)
and London’s metropolitan police force,
which at present is responsible to the Home
Secretary. (For details of the police service,
which is financed by central and local
government, see pp. 218—21.)
Proposals for London Government
At present London is the only Western capital
without an elected city-wide government. In
July 1997 the Government issued proposals for
establishing a Greater London Authority made
up of an elected mayor and a separately elected
assembly. The proposed authority, which
would encompass the 32 London boroughs and
the City of London Corporation, would not
duplicate the work of the London boroughs, but
would take responsibility for London-wide
issues such as transport, economic development,
environmental protection, planning, police and
fire services. The Corporation of the City of
London has produced its own proposals for
reforming its existing franchise in order to
prevent abuse and to extend the electoral system
to give a wider variety of bodies and
organisations voting rights within the City.
In a referendum held in May 1998, the
residents of London voted in favour of the
Government’s proposals. Subject to
parliamentary approval, legislation will be
introduced to set up the authority, with a view
to holding the first elections for the mayor and
60
GOVERNMENT
assembly in late 1999 or 2000. Subsequent
elections would take place every four years.
English Metropolitan County Areas
The six metropolitan county areas—Tyne and
Wear, West Midlands, Merseyside, Greater
Manchester, West Yorkshire and South
Yorkshire—have 36 district councils, but no
county councils. The district councils are
responsible for all services apart from those
which require a statutory authority over areas
wider than the individual boroughs and
districts—namely, waste disposal (in certain
areas); the fire services, including civil
defence; and public transport. These are run
by joint authorities composed of elected
councillors nominated by the borough or
district councils.
English Non-Metropolitan Counties
Before the recent reforms, England—outside
Greater London and the metropolitan areas—
was divided into counties and sub-divided into
districts. All the counties and districts had
locally elected councils with separate
functions. County councils provided large-
scale services, while district councils were
responsible for the more local ones. These
arrangements are broadly continuing in areas
where two-tier local government will remain.
County councils are responsible for
transport planning, highways, traffic
regulation, education,12 consumer protection,
refuse disposal, the fire service, libraries and
the personal social services. District councils
are responsible for environmental health,
housing, decisions on most local planning
applications, and refuse collection. Both tiers
of local authority have powers to provide
facilities such as museums, art galleries and
parks; arrangements depend on local
agreement. In areas where the new unitary
authorities have been set up, county and
district level functions have merged.
12 Under the Education Reform Act 1988, schools have
been able ‘opt out’ of local education authority control by
obtaining grant-maintained status. However, legislation has
now passed through Parliament to end the grant-
maintained schools programme (see p. 123).
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, over 10,000 parish
councils or meetings provide and manage local
facilities such as allotments and village halls,
and act as agents for other district council
functions. They also provide a forum for
discussion of local issues.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
In Scotland the 32 single-tier councils are
responsible for the full range of local
government services. In Wales the 22 single¬
tier councils have similar functions, except
that fire services are provided by three
combined fire authorities. In addition, about
730 community councils in Wales have
functions similar to those of the parish
councils in England (see above); in Scotland
community councils exist to represent the
views of their local communities to local
authorities and other public bodies in the area.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are
responsible for local environmental and
certain other services, such as leisure and the
arts. Responsibility for planning, roads, water
supply and sewerage services is exercised in
each district through a divisional office of the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland. Area boards, responsible to central
departments, administer education, public
libraries and the health and personal social
services locally.
Initiatives announced in June 1997 to
strengthen local government in the Province
included the possibility of legislation to give
councils ‘a power of general competence’ to do
what they consider appropriate in the interests
of their district; proposals to increase the
representation of councillors on public bodies;
and a fuller consultation between district
councils and central government, particularly
in planning.
Election of Councils
Local councils consist of elected councillors.
In England and Wales each council elects its
presiding officer annually. Some districts have
the ceremonial title of borough, or city, both
granted by royal authority. In boroughs and
cities the presiding officer is normally known
61
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Fire Services in the UK
Every part of the UK is covered by a local authority fire service. Each of the 64 fire authorities
must by law make provision for firefighting and maintain a brigade to meet efficiently all
normal firefighting requirements. Each fire authority appoints a Chief Fire Officer
(Firemaster in Scotland) who exercises day-to-day control from brigade headquarters. The
fire services in England and Wales employ 50,000 staff and spend £1,400 million each year.
UK Fire Statistics: 1997
• In 1997 local authority fire brigades attended around 960,000 fires or false alarms—a fall
of 6% on 1996. The decrease is due mainly to an 18% drop in outdoor fires as a result of
the year’s relatively wet summer. Other provisional figures for 1997 show that compared
with 1996:
• fire-related deaths increased by 3% to 770;
• non-fatal casualties increased by 1% to 18,429;
• the total number of fires attended was 465,900, a fall of 12%;
• the number of fires in buildings fell by 2% to 111,900;
• malicious alarms fell for the fifth successive year to 100,000;
• false alarms remained unchanged at nearly 490,000.
In the last ten years, 6,000 people have died in house fires and more than 120,000 people
have been injured. In April 1998 the Government announced a new strategy for England and
Wales to reduce the number of fires and casualties. This includes making the current
community fire safety arrangements (that is, efforts by brigades and Government to prevent
fires in the home through education and publicity) a statutory duty.
as the Mayor. In the City of London and
certain other large cities, he or she is known as
the Lord Mayor. In Scotland the presiding
officer of the council of each of the four
cities—Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and
Glasgow—is called the Lord Provost.
Councillors are elected for four years. All
county councils in England, borough councils
in London, and about two-thirds of non¬
metropolitan district councils are elected in
their entirety every four years. In the
remaining districts (including all metropolitan
districts) one-third of the councillors are
elected in each of the three years when county
council elections are not held. In the interests
of greater accountability, the recent White
Paper (see p. 60) proposes that all unitary
authorities in non-metropolitan districts and
London boroughs should adopt a pattern of
elections similar to that in metropolitan
districts. It also proposes that other authorities
should adopt arrangements where, in alternate
years, elections take place for half of the
district council and then, in the following
year, half of the county council.
In Scotland whole council elections are
held every three years, with the next elections
due in 1999. In Wales whole council elections
are held every fourth year, again with the next
due in 1999. The Government intends to give
the National Assembly for Wales a power to
determine the frequency of council elections.
County, district and unitary authority
councillors are paid a basic allowance but may
also be entitled to additional allowances and
expenses for attending meetings or taking on
special responsibilities. The Government
proposes to introduce legislation to enable
councils to decide for themselves the appropriate
level of remuneration for councillors.
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in the UK provided he or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• a citizen of the UK or of another
62
GOVERNMENT
Commonwealth country, or of the Irish
Republic, or elsewhere in the EU;
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote;
• on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must be
resident in the council area on the qualifying
date.
Candidates
Most candidates at local government elections
stand as representatives of a national political
party, although some stand as independents.
Candidates must be British citizens, other
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of the EU,
and aged 21 or over. They must also either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the relevant local authority; or
• have occupied (as owner or tenant) land
or premises in that area during the whole
of the preceding 12 months; or
• have had their main place of work in the
area throughout this 12-month period.
No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee. All candidates
for district council elections in Northern
Ireland are required to make a declaration
against terrorism.
Electoral Areas and Procedure
Counties in England are divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Districts in England and Northern Ireland are
divided into wards, returning one councillor
or more. In Scotland the new unitary councils
are divided into wards and in Wales into
electoral divisions; each returns one councillor
or more. Parishes (in England) and
communities (in Wales) may be divided into
wards, returning at least one councillor.
The procedure for local government voting
in Great Britain is broadly similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
district councils are elected by proportional
representation on the grounds that it allows
for the representation of sizeable minorities.
The electoral arrangements of local
authorities in England are kept under review
by the Local Government Commission (see
p. 60), and in Wales and Scotland by the Local
Government Boundary Commissions. Under
legislation passed in 1997, electoral
arrangements in England and Wales for
parishes and communities can be reviewed by
local councils.
Provision of Local Services
In recent years, there has been a move away
from direct service provision, to a greater use of
private contractors, and an increase in what is
often called the ‘enabling’ role. Local authorities
now carry out many functions in partnership
with other organisations, public and private.
For example, under community care
arrangements (see p. 166), councils with social
services responsibilities draw up care plans for
those who need them, but the care is often
provided by the private or voluntary sectors
funded by the council rather than directly by
the local authority itself.
The previous administration introduced
legislation in the 1980s aimed at encouraging
local authorities to contract out the services
they provide. It introduced a practice known
as compulsory competitive tendering (CCT),
under which many services traditionally
provided by the council’s own staff, such as
refuse collection and leisure management,
must now be put out to tender and won in
open competition.
In a departure from the approach of its
predecessor, the Government is developing a
new system designed to achieve best value in
the delivery of local government services. It
considers that councils should not be forced to
put their services out to tender, but equally it
sees no reason why a service should be
delivered directly if more efficient means are
available elsewhere. It intends to replace CCT
with a new duty for local councils to ensure
best value for the public. This duty will be to
deliver services to clear standards by the most
effective, economic and efficient means
available. Legislation will be introduced as
soon as the parliamentary timetable allows.
Before replacing CCT, pilot schemes are
being run in some local authority areas to see
how a Best Value regime would work.
The Best Value programme aims to
encourage local accountability and involve
63
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
local communities in deciding the quality,
level and cost of local services. Local
authorities will be expected to set themselves
challenging targets for the improvement of
services following regular reviews of their
performance. Local people will be able to see
how well their authority is performing
through the publication of annual
performance plans.
A White Paper containing proposals for
modernising local government in Wales was
published in July 1998. The Government of
Wales Act (see p. 26) requires the National
Assembly to set up a Partnership Council to
oversee relations between the Assembly and
local government. A Commission to establish
effective relations between local government
and the new Scottish Parliament has been set
up (see chapter 4).
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom to
make arrangements for carrying out their
duties. Some decisions are made by the full
council; many other matters are delegated to
committees composed of members of the
council, although certain powers are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales are
often able to do their work in full session,
although they appoint committees from time
to time as necessary.
In England and Wales committees
generally have to reflect the political
composition of the council (although the
legislation governing this specifically excludes
parish or community councils). In practice,
this is the case in Scotland, although it is not
enforced by legislation. People who are not
members of the council may be co-opted onto
decision-making committees and can speak
and take part in debates; they cannot normally
vote. Legislation also prevents senior council
officers and others in politically sensitive posts
from being members of another local authority
or undertaking public political activity. Some,
but not all, of these provisions have been
introduced in Northern Ireland.
The recent local government White Papers
(see p. 60) criticised these arrangements for
producing a lack of openness, for being
inefficient, and for preventing councillors
from spending more time with those they
represent. The Government has proposed a
separation between the executive and the
back-bench role of councillors, and has
suggested a range of models to achieve this,
including directly elected mayors.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are admitted
to council, committee and sub-committee
meetings, and have access to agendas, reports
and minutes of meetings and certain
background papers. Local authorities may
exclude the public from meetings and
withhold these papers only in limited
circumstances.
Employees
About 1.9 million people13 are employed by
local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and
technical staff, teachers, fire-fighters, and
manual workers, but exclude those in law and
order services. Education is the largest service,
accounting for over 30% of expenditure.
Councils are individually responsible, within
certain national legislative requirements, for
deciding the structure of their workforces.
Senior staff appointments are usually made
by the elected councillors. More junior
appointments are made by heads of
departments. Pay and conditions of service are
usually a matter for each council, but most
authorities follow the scales recommended as a
result of national negotiation between
authorities and trade unions.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 25% of public spending. In 1997-98
expenditure by local authorities in the UK was
about £75,700 million. Current expenditure
amounted to £66,000 million; capital
expenditure, net of capital receipts, was
13 Full-time equivalents.

is financed primarily by borrowing within
limits set by central government and from
capital receipts from the disposal of land and
buildings.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through the council tax (see chapter
23), which meets about 20% of their revenue
expenditure. Their spending is, however,
financed primarily by grants from central
government and by the redistribution of
revenue from the national non-domestic rate,
a property tax levied on businesses and other
non-domestic properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland
continue to raise revenue through the levying
of a domestic rate and business rates.
Financial Safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be
audited by independent auditors appointed by
the Audit Commission in England and Wales,
or in Scotland by the Accounts Commission
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland this role is
exercised by the chief local government
auditor, who, at present, is appointed by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland.
Local Government Complaints System
Local authorities are encouraged to resolve
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public will often ask their own
councillor for help in this. Local authorities
must also appoint a monitoring officer, whose
duties include ensuring that the local authority
acts lawfully in the conduct of its business.
Complaints of alleged local government
maladministration leading to injustice may be
investigated by statutory independent
Commissioners for Local Administration, often
known as ‘local government ombudsmen’.
There are three of these in England, and one
each in Wales and Scotland. A report is issued
on each complaint fully investigated and, if
injustice caused by maladministration is found,
the local ombudsman normally proposes a
remedy. The council must consider the report
and reply to it. In 1997-98 the local government
ombudsmen for England received 14,969
complaints, 2% fewer than in 1996-97. Of the
15,262 decided, 451 led to the issue of a formal
report. In Wales the corresponding figures were
1,048 complaints, 3.4% more than in 1996-97.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of maladministration
by district councils and certain other public
bodies.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Pressure Groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations
which aim to influence the decision-making of
Parliament and Government, to the benefit of
their members and the causes they support.
There is a huge range of groups, covering
politics, business, employment, consumer
affairs, ethnic minorities, aid to developing
countries, foreign relations, education,
culture, defence, religion, sport, transport,
social welfare, animal welfare and the
environment. Some have over a million
members, others only a few dozen. Some exert
pressure on a number of different issues;
others are concerned with a single issue. Some
have come to play a recognised role in the way
the UK is governed; others seek influence
through radical protest.
Pressure Groups and Policy
Pressure groups operating at a national level
have a number of methods for influencing the
way the UK is governed. Their action may
highlight a particular problem, which is then
acknowledged by the Government. Groups
whose scale of membership indicates that they
are broadly representative in their field may
then be consulted by a government
department, or take part in Whitehall working
groups or advisory councils. If the
Government considers that legislation is
necessary, then proposals are drafted, which
are circulated to interested groups for their
comments. Legislation is then put before
Parliament, and at various times during the
passage of a Bill pressure groups have
opportunities to influence its content.
Pressure Groups and Government
The principle of consultation to gain the
consent and co-operation of as wide a range of
organisations as possible, and ensure the smooth
working of laws and regulations, plays an
important part in the relationship between
government departments and interested groups.
In some instances a department is under a
legal obligation to consult interested groups.
The Government has a duty to consult
organised interests, providing the pressure
groups involved have a broad enough
membership for them to represent a majority
view, and provided that they observe
confidentiality about their discussions with
the department. Members of pressure groups
often have direct expertise, and an awareness
of what is practicable, and can give advice and
information to civil servants engaged in
preparing policy or legislation. In return, the
pressure groups have the opportunity to
express their opinions directly to the
Government. The contacts between civil
servants and pressure group representatives
may be relatively informal—by letter or
telephone—or more formal, through
involvement in working parties or by giving
evidence to committees of inquiry.
Administration by Pressure Groups
The Government also makes grants to
pressure groups which, as well as speaking on
behalf of their members or for an issue,
provide a service. For example, Relate:
National Marriage Guidance has received
grants for the advice centres it runs, and
government departments make grants to a
number of pressure groups for research
relating to public policy.
Pressure Groups and Parliament
Lobbying—the practice of approaching MPs
or Lords, persuading them to act on behalf of
a cause, and enabling them to do so by
providing advice and information—has
substantially increased in recent years.
A common pressure group tactic is to ask
members of the public to write to their MP
about an issue—for example, the Sunday
trading laws, or the plight of political
prisoners in particular countries—in order to
raise awareness and persuade the MP to
support the cause.
Parliamentary Lobbyists
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers,
whose job is to develop contacts with MPs and
Lords sympathetic to their cause, and to brief
66
GOVERNMENT
them when issues affecting the group are
raised in Parliament.
There are also public relations and political
consultancy firms specialising in lobbying
Parliament and Government. Such firms are
employed by pressure groups—as well as by
British and overseas companies and
organisations—to monitor parliamentary
business, and to promote their clients’ interests
where they are affected by legislation and debate.
Raising Issues in Parliament
Other ways through which pressure groups
may exert influence include:
• suggesting to MPs or Lords subjects for
Private Members’ Bills (see p. 46); many
pressure groups have ready-drafted
legislation waiting to be sponsored;
• approaching MPs or Lords to ask
parliamentary questions as a means of
gaining information from the
Government and of drawing public
attention to an issue;
• suggesting to MPs subjects for Early Day
Motions (see p. 49) and suggesting to
Lords subjects for debates; and
• orchestrating public petitions as a form of
protest against government policy, or to
call for action.
The UK in the European
Union
As a member of the European Union, the UK
is bound by the various types of Community
legislation and wider policies (see chapter 7).
The Community enacts legislation which is
binding on the national governments of the 15
member states or, in certain circumstances, on
individuals and companies within those states.
British Government ministers take part in the
discussions and decision-making, and the final
decision is taken collectively by all the
member states.
The EU has three legislative bodies:
The Council of the European Union is
the main decision-making body. Member
states are represented by the ministers
appropriate to the subject under discussion.
When, for instance, education matters are
being discussed, the UK’s Secretary of State
for Education and Employment attends with
his or her European counterparts. The
Presidency of the Council changes at six-
monthly intervals; the UK assumed it in
January 1998 (see chapter 7).
The European Council, which usually
meets twice a year, comprises the heads of
State or Government accompanied by their
foreign ministers and the President of the
European Commission and one other
Commissioner. The Council defines general
political guidelines and has an important role
in common foreign and security policy.
The European Commission is the
executive of the EU. It implements the
Council’s decisions, initiates EC legislation
and ensures that member states put it into
effect. Each of the 20 Commissioners, who are
drawn from all member states (there are two
from the UK), is responsible for a specific
policy area, for example, education, transport,
agriculture. The Commissioners are entirely
independent of their countries, and serve the
EU as a whole.
The European Parliament, which plays
an increasingly important role in the EC
legislative process, has 626 directly-elected
members (MEPs), including 87 from the UK.
The Parliament is consulted about major
decisions and has substantial shared power
with the Council of the European Union over
the EC budget. In areas of legislation, its role
varies between: consultation, where it can
influence but does not have the final say in the
content of legislation; the co-operation and
assent procedures, where its influence is
greater; and codecision (introduced by the
Maastricht Treaty—see chapter 7), where a
proposal requires the agreement of both the
Council and the European Parliament.
Elections to the Parliament take place every
five years, the most recent having taken place
in 1994. At present British MEPs in England,
Scotland and Wales are elected by a simple
majority system in single-member
constituencies. (In Northern Ireland the single
transferable system of proportional
67
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
representation is used.) Legislation is before
the UK Parliament to enable the June 1999
and subsequent elections to be held under a
proportional voting system14 to bring it into
line with the other member states.
EC legislation is issued in some areas
jointly by the Council of the European Union
and the European Parliament, by the Council
in other areas, or by the Commission under
delegated powers. It consists of Regulations,
Directives and Decisions.
• Regulations are directly applicable in all
member states, and have the force of law
without the need for further
implementing measures;
u The regional list system is proposed. Under this, an
elector may cast his or her vote in one of two ways: for a
party list of candidates or for an independent candidate.
England would be divided into nine regions while Scotland
and Wales would each constitute one region. These 11
regions would each return between 4 and 11 MEPs,
depending on the size of the electorate of each region.
• Directives are equally binding as to the
result to be achieved but allow each
member state to choose the form and
method of implementation; and
• Decisions, like Regulations, do not
normally need national implementing
legislation. They are binding on those to
whom they are addressed.
Other EU Institutions
Each member state provides one of the judges
to serve in the European Court of Justice,
which is the final authority on all aspects of
Community law. Its rulings must be applied
by member states, and fines can be imposed
on those failing to do so. The Court is assisted
by a Court of First Instance, which handles
certain cases brought by individuals and
companies. The UK is also represented on the
Court of Auditors, which examines
Community revenue and expenditure, to see
that it is legally received and spent.

The aims of British foreign policy are to promote the interests of the United
Kingdom abroad and to contribute to a strong international community. The UK
is one of the 15 member states of the European Union, and a close ally of the
United States, with a central position in the Commonwealth and in the United
Nations Security Council. It maintains a worldwide presence through 221
diplomatic posts and has diplomatic or consular relations with 186 countries.
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
Active membership of the United Nations, the
European Union, the Commonwealth, NATO,
the Western European Union and other major
international organisations remains central to
the UK Government’s foreign policy objectives.
United Nations (UN)
The UK is a founder member of the UN and
one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, along with China, France,
Russia and the United States. It supports the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter,
including the maintenance of international
peace and security, the development of
friendly relations among nations, the
achievement of international co-operation on
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian
issues and the protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
The UK is the sixth largest contributor to
the UN regular budget (just over 5% in 1998)
and a significant contributor to peacekeeping
operations (see p. 84). In order to maintain the
UN’s effectiveness against a background of
continuing financial difficulties, the UK is
pressing for institutional and financial reform.
An EU initiative, arising from British-French
proposals, comprises measures to revise the
method of calculating member states’
contributions to reflect more closely their
capacity to pay, and to introduce penalties and
incentives to encourage prompt payment of
dues. The UK supports early enlargement of
the Security Council to make its membership
more representative of the world today.
European Union (EU)
The UK is a member of the EU (see also pp.
67 and 76-80), which comprises the European
69
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The European Union
70
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Community (EC) and intergovernmental co¬
operation on foreign and security policy, and
on justice and home affairs. The EU has 15
member nations with a combined population
of over 370 million citizens; they are Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and the UK.
The Commonwealth
There are 54 members of the Commonwealth,
including the UK. It is a voluntary association
of states, nearly all of which were British
territories but are now independent, and
includes more than one in four people in
the world.
The members are Antigua and Barbuda,
Australia, the Bahamas, Bangladesh,
Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Brunei
Darussalam, Cameroon, Canada, Cyprus,
Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana,
Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya,
Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia,
Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand, Nigeria
(suspended), Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, St
Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri
Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad
and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, United
Kingdom, Vanuatu, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Nauru and Tuvalu are special members,
entitled to take part in all Commonwealth
meetings and activities, with the exception of
the biennial Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meetings. Nigeria was
suspended at the 1995 heads of government
meeting because of political repression and
human rights abuses.
The Queen is head of the Commonwealth
and is head of state in the UK and 15 other
member countries. In 1997 the UK hosted the
Heads of Government Meeting for the first
time in 20 years; its main theme was trade,
investment and development.
The Commonwealth Secretariat, based in
London, is the main agency for multilateral
communication between member
governments on matters relevant to the
Commonwealth as a whole. The Secretariat
promotes consultation and co-operation,
disseminates information, and helps the host
government to organise Heads of Government
Meetings, ministerial meetings and other
conferences. It administers co-operative
programmes agreed at these meetings,
including the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Co-operation, which provides
consultancy services and training awards to
Commonwealth developing countries.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO)
Membership of NATO is central to UK
defence policy (see p. 97). NATO’s core
functions are to:
• provide the foundation of security and
defence in the North Atlantic area,
linking European security with that of
North America;
• guarantee members’ security through
collective defence;
• sustain and develop an integrated
military command structure; and
• act as the primary forum for consultation
among Allies on security and defence
issues.
Each of the 16 member states (Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United
Kingdom and the United States) has a
permanent representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland were invited to
join the Alliance in 1997, and it is planned that
they will attend NATO’s Washington Summit
as full members in 1999. The main decision¬
taking body is the North Atlantic Council. It
meets at least twice a year at foreign minister
level, and weekly at the level of permanent
representatives. Defence ministers also meet
at least twice a year.
Western European Union (WEU)
The UK is a full member of the WEU, which
is the main forum for co-operation and
71
The Commonwealth

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
consultation on defence and security issues for
NATO’s European members. The WEU’s
other full members are Belgium, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Iceland,
Norway and Turkey are associate members;
Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland and
Sweden are observers. ‘Associate partnership’
has been extended to ten Central European
and Baltic states.
The Group of Eight
The UK is part of the Group of Eight (G8)
leading industrialised countries. The other
members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia (included as a full member from
1998) and the United States. The G8 is an
informal group with no Secretariat. Its
Presidency rotates each year among the
members, the key meeting being an annual
summit of heads of government. Originally
formed in 1975 to discuss economic issues, the
G8 agenda now includes a wide range of
foreign affairs and international issues such as
terrorism, nuclear safety, the environment,
UN reform and development assistance.
Heads of state or government agree a
communique issued at the end of summits
which commits each country to co-ordinate
individual action towards common goals.
The 1998 meeting of the group, hosted by
the UK in Birmingham in May, focused on
achieving sustainable economic growth and
development throughout the world, building
lasting growth in the G8 economies, and
tackling drugs and international crime.
Organisation for Security and Co¬
operation in Europe (OSCE)
The UK is member of the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
which is a pan-European organisation with 54
participating states. All states participate on an
equal basis, and decisions are taken by
consensus. The OSCE has a Secretariat in
Vienna, where the UK has a permanent
delegation. The main areas of work are:
• early warning of potential conflict
through preventive diplomacy missions
and the work of the OSCE High
Commissioner on National Minorities;
• observing elections and providing advice
on human rights, democracy and law (see
p. 88); and
• promoting security through arms control
and military confidence-building.
The OSCE is responsible under the
Dayton Peace Agreement (see p. 85) for
preparation of elections, monitoring human
rights and arms control in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
Council of Europe
The UK is a founding member of the Council
of Europe, which is open to any European
state accepting parliamentary democracy and
the protection of fundamental human rights
and the rule of law. There are 40 full member
states. ‘Special guest status’ has been granted
to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and Georgia (but suspended in
the case of Belarus). One of the Council’s
main achievements is its adoption of the
European Convention on Human Rights in
1950 (see p. 87).
The second summit of the Council in
October 1997 adopted an action plan for
increased co-operation on democracy and
human rights, social cohesion, security of
citizens and cultural diversity.
Other International Bodies
The UK belongs to many other international
bodies, and was a founder member of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank. The IMF regulates the
international financial system and provides
credit for member countries facing balance-of-
payments difficulties. The World Bank
provides loans to finance economic and social
projects in developing countries.
In addition, the UK is a member of the
World Trade Organisation (WTO—see
p. 407), and of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD)
which promotes economic growth, support for
less developed countries and worldwide trade
expansion.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Other organisations to which Britain
belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia, and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
OVERSEAS TERRITORIES
The UK’s Overseas Territories (formerly
known as the Dependent Territories—see
below) have a combined population of nearly
200,000. The territories are: Anguilla;
Bermuda; British Antarctic Territory; British
Indian Ocean Territory; British Virgin
Islands; Cayman Islands; Falkland Islands;
Gibraltar; Montserrat; Pitcairn, Ducie,
Henderson and Oeno; St Helena and St
Helena Dependencies (Ascension and Tristan
da Cunha); South Georgia and the South
Sandwich Islands; and Turks and Caicos
Islands.
Most territories have considerable self-
government, with their own legislatures.
Governors appointed by the Queen are
responsible for external affairs, internal
security (including the police) and the public
service. Certain responsibilities are delegated
to locally elected representatives but the
ultimate responsibility for all government
affairs rests with British Ministers. The
British Indian Ocean Territory, the British
Antarctic Territory, and South Georgia and
the South Sandwich Islands have non-resident
commissioners, not governors.
The UK seeks to provide the Overseas
Territories with security and political stability,
ensure efficient and honest government, and
help them achieve economic and social
development on a par with neighbouring
countries. It is British policy to help the
inhabitants of the territories to take
independence if they want it and where it is
practicable, and to do so in accordance with
treaty obligations. The reasonable needs of the
territories are a first call on the UK
development aid programme (see p. 89).
Following a review of UK stewardship
conducted in 1997, the British Government
has changed the name ‘Dependent Territories’
to ‘Overseas Territories’, reflecting more
accurately their modern character, partnership
status and high degree of autonomy. A new
Overseas Territories Department within the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO—see
p. 93) is being established to provide a single
focus and direct point of contact with the UK
Government. The Department for
International Development (see p. 89) also
plans to set up an Overseas Territories Unit
which will administer DFID aid to Anguilla,
the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, the
Turks and Caicos Islands and St Helena. The
Dependent Territories Regional Secretariat in
Barbados, which has administered aspects of
British government policy towards the
Caribbean territories, closed in 1998.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina. The UK
Government does not accept the Argentine
claim and is committed to defending the
Islanders’ right to live under a government of
their own choice. The inhabitants wish to
remain under British sovereignty and this
right of self-determination is enshrined in the
1985 Falkland Islands Constitution.
In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied the
Islands, but its forces were expelled by British
troops following Argentina’s failure to abide by
UN resolutions requesting its forces to
withdraw. The UK and Argentina, while
sticking to their respective positions on
sovereignty, maintain diplomatic relations and
continue to discuss their common interests in
the South Atlantic region, such as fisheries
conservation and the exploitation of oil reserves.
Gibraltar
Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in perpetuity
by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht but has long
sought its return. However, the UK is firmly
committed to the principle, set out in the 1969
Gibraltar Constitution, that it will never enter
into arrangements under which the people of
Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of
another state against their freely and
democratically expressed wishes.
Gibraltar has an elected House of Assembly
and responsibility for a wide range of ‘defined
domestic matters’ is devolved to elected local

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
ministers. The territory is within the EU, as
part of the United Kingdom member state,
although it is outside the common customs
system and does not participate in the Common
Agricultural or Fisheries Policies or the EU’s
value added tax arrangements. The people of
Gibraltar have been declared UK nationals for
EU purposes.
EUROPEAN UNION POLICY
The UK Government wants to play a
constructive part in the EU, working with its
partners as colleagues in a shared enterprise.
In the national interest the UK retains its veto
on issues such as taxation, social security,
defence and foreign policy decisions, the EU
budget and changes in the EU treaties. On
assuming the Presidency of the EU for a six-
month period from January to June 1998, the
UK’s agenda included:
• the promotion of strategies for economic
reform and employment;
• working for the launch of economic and
monetary union (EMU—see p. 77) and
making progress on enlargement,
including opening accession negotiations
with those countries ready to do so (see
p. 77);
• an effective external policy; and
• taking forward common action on
international crime, drugs and
environmental concerns.
The European Council meeting in Cardiff
in June 1998 reviewed progress on these
issues, and also set a deadline of March 1999
for reaching agreement on European
Commission proposals for reform of EU
policies (such as the Common Agricultural
Policy and the Structural Funds) and their
financing. It also decided to convene a special
summit in October 1998 to discuss future
institutional reform of the EU.
Background: The Treaties
The Union had its origins in the post-Second
World War resolve by Western European
nations, particularly France and Germany, to
prevent further conflict and establish lasting
peace and stability.
Rome Treaty
The 1957 Rome Treaty, establishing the
European Community, defined its aims as the
harmonious development of economic
activities, a continuous and balanced economic
expansion and an accelerated rise in the
standard of living. These objectives were to be
achieved by the creation of a common internal
market, including the elimination of customs
duties between member states, free movement
of goods, people, services and capital, and the
elimination of distortions in competition
within this market. These aims were
reaffirmed by the 1986 Single European Act,
which agreed measures to complete the single
market (see p. 78). The UK joined the
Community in 1973.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of the UK and
the other member states in international
trade negotiations. The Commission
negotiates on a mandate agreed by the
European Council. (For further information
on trade, see chapter 24.)
Maastricht Treaty
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty amended the
Rome Treaty and made other new
commitments, including moves towards
economic and monetary union. It established
the EU, which comprises the European
Community and intergovernmental
arrangements for a Common Foreign and
Security Policy (see p. 80) and for increased
co-operation on interior/justice policy issues
(see p. 80). The Maastricht Treaty also
codified the principle of subsidiarity under
which, in areas where the Community and
member states share competence, action
should be taken at European level only if its
objectives cannot be achieved by member
states acting alone and can be better achieved
by the Community. The Treaty also
introduced the concept of EU citizenship as a
supplement to national citizenship.
76
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Amsterdam Treaty
Following the Maastricht Treaty, an
intergovernmental conference was convened
in 1996 to consider further amendments. This
resulted in the Amsterdam Treaty signed by
member states in October 1997 (and expected
to come into force in early 1999). Among the
main points are:
• provisions for the Council to take action
to combat discrimination on the basis of
gender, race, religion, sexual orientation,
disability or age;
• more co-ordination by member states of
measures designed to cut unemployment;
• integration of the social chapter (see
p. 79) into the Treaty, following its
adoption by the UK;
• new mechanisms to improve the co¬
ordination and effectiveness of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP);
• arrangements for improved co-operation
between the EU and Western European
Union on the defence aspects of the
CFSP;
• an increase in the areas subject to co¬
decision between the Council of
Ministers and European Parliament, and
simplification of the co-decision
procedure (see p. 67); and
• a binding protocol on subsidiarity.
Treaty Ratification
Any amendments to the Treaties must be
agreed unanimously and must then be ratified
by each member state according to its own
constitutional procedures. In the UK, Treaty
ratifications must be approved by Parliament
before they can come into force.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged economic
and monetary union in three stages. The first,
completion of the single market (see p. 78),
was largely achieved at the end of 1993. The
second stage included the establishment of a
European Monetary Institute (EMI)
responsible for technical preparations for stage
3 and for strengthening co-ordination of
member states’ monetary policy. Stage 3,
beginning on 1 January 1999, is the adoption
of a single currency (the euro).
In May 1998, a meeting of EU heads of
state and government agreed that 11 of the 15
EU member states (excluding the UK,
Denmark, Greece and Sweden) would take
part in the single currency from 1 January
1999. It also agreed the establishment of the
European Central Bank (ECB), which will be
responsible for interest rates, from June 1998
(at which point the EMI went into
liquidation).
On 1 January 1999 conversion rates
between currencies of qualifying countries and
the euro will be legally fixed. The euro will
become the legal currency in those countries.
Since no euro banknotes or coins will be
available until 1 January 2002, national
currencies will continue to exist in parallel to
the euro and national banknotes and coins will
be used for all cash transactions.
The UK Government has said that it wants
the single currency to succeed. In that event,
and if the economic benefits to the UK are
clear and unambiguous, the Government
believes that, in principle, the UK should join.
However, it has decided that the UK economy
has neither the flexibility nor sufficient
convergence with other European economies
to make joining in 1999 in the national
economic interest. Barring any fundamental
and unforeseen change in economic
circumstances, the UK Government will not
take the decision to join during the lifetime of
the present Parliament.
Enlargement
A priority of EU policy is enlargement to
include those European nations sharing its
democratic values and objectives, and able to
take on the obligations of membership. In
December 1997 the European Council agreed
to establish a European Conference for the 15
EU member states and those countries
wishing to join (Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Slovakia,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Cyprus
77
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
and Turkey). The Conference met in London
in mid-March 1998 (Turkey chose not to
attend). At the end of that month the
accession process of the 10 Central European
applicants and Cyprus was launched and
accession negotiations were opened with
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
The EU has recognised Turkey’s eligibility
for membership and is pursuing closer
political and economic co-operation on the
basis of a strategy endorsed at the Cardiff
European Council in June 1998.
European Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of:
• levies on agricultural imports from non¬
member countries;
• customs duties;
• the proceeds of a notional rate of value
added tax of up to 1.4% on a standard
‘basket’ of goods and services; and
• contributions from member states based
on gross national product (GNP).
The UK has an annual rebate worth some
£2,000 million because, without it, the British
net contribution would be far greater than that
justified by its share of Community GNP.
The Government has made it clear that it
intends to maintain the rebate.
Single Market
The single market, providing for the free
movement of people, goods, services and
capital within the EU, came into effect at the
start of 1993. Largely complete in legislative
terms, it covers, among other benefits, the
removal of customs barriers, the liberalisation
of capital movements, the opening of public
procurement markets and the mutual
recognition of professional qualifications.
Measures to improve the operation and
effectiveness of the single market were
approved by the European Council in 1997.
These sought to ensure the removal of
remaining obstacles, with better
implementation and enforcement of existing
rules, and action to simplify internal market
legislation. In June 1998 the European
Council reaffirmed its commitment to
transpose the remaining overdue single
market directives into national laws by the
end of the year.
Under the European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement, which came into force in 1994,
most of the EU single market measures have
been extended to Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein. EEA member states comprise
the world’s largest trading bloc, accounting for
40% of all global trade.
Transport, Energy and
T elecommunications
The concept of a common transport policy
was laid down in the Treaty of Rome.
Liberalisation measures relating to transport
are described in chapter 22.
The EU’s objectives in energy policy are
security of supply, liberalised energy markets
and environmental protection. Work on gas
market liberalisation, on improving
management of energy programmes, and
action in the areas of renewable energies,
combined heat and power and energy
efficiency are progressing.
The EU is also working towards the
completion of trans-European networks in
transport, energy and telecommunications.
The aim is to improve the interconnection and
interoperability of national networks. To this
end, 14 transport projects were identified as a
priority by the European Council in June
1998. Most of the legislation on liberalisation
of the EU’s telecommunications market was in
force by the beginning of 1998.
Agriculture and Fisheries
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It has also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing a burden on the Community’s budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is concerned
with the conservation and management of
fishery resources. See chapter 27 for further
details of these policies, and of the UK’s
support for CAP reform.

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Regional and Infrastructure
Development
The economic and social disparities within the
EU are considerable, and will become more
evident with further enlargement. To address
the problem of regional imbalances there are a
number of Structural Funds designed to:
• promote economic development in
underdeveloped regions;
• regenerate regions affected by industrial
decline;
• combat long-term unemployment and
facilitate the entry of young people into
the labour market;
• help workers adapt to industrial changes
and to advances in production systems;
• speed up the adjustment of production,
processing and marketing structures in
agriculture; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and industrial
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the unemployed
and young people. The Guidance Section of
the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund supports agricultural
restructuring and some rural development
measures. The Financial Instrument of
Fisheries Guidance supports the
modernisation of the fishing industry. A
Cohesion Fund, set up under the Maastricht
Treaty, provides financial help to reduce
disparities between EU members’ economies.
Other initiatives promote new economic
activities in regions affected by the
restructuring of traditional industries, such as
steel, coal and shipbuilding.
The European Investment Bank, a non-
profit-making institution, lends at competitive
interest rates to public and private capital
investment projects.
Employment and Social Affairs
The UK accepted the social chapter (a
separate protocol to the Maastricht Treaty) at
the EU Amsterdam Council in June 1997 and
agreed to implement the measures already
adopted under it by the other 14 member
states.1 The Government wants to ensure that
any new measures promote labour market
flexibility, and contribute to EU
competitiveness, without placing undue
burdens or costs on UK business.
At a special European Council on
employment in November 1997, EU member
states agreed demanding guidelines to shape
their national employment policies and
committed themselves to producing national
action plans to show progress towards
implementation. The aims are to improve
employability, develop entrepreneurship,
modernise work organisation and strengthen
policies for equal opportunities. Under the
UK Presidency, all 15 EU members submitted
action plans putting the guidelines into effect.
The UK Presidency also opened
discussions on the next generation of
education, training and youth programmes
(for current arrangements see p. 144), so they
can be shaped specifically to support ‘lifelong
learning’; it also took forward initiatives to
improve labour mobility and increase
European skills levels.
Research and Development
EU spending programmes on research and
development (R&D) play an increasingly
important role in enabling Europe to maintain
the science and technology base necessary to
remain competitive in world markets.
Research collaboration among member states
is promoted primarily through a series of
framework programmes defining priorities
and setting out the overall level of funding.
The Government actively encourages British
companies and organisations to participate in
collaborative research and development with
European partners (see p. 413).
1 In October 1998 the UK implemented EC Directives on
working time and young workers, which provide that
employees do not have to work more than an average of
48 hours a week without their consent. The Government
intends to implement other Directives relating to parental
leave and worker consultation in December 1999 and
employment rights of part-time workers in April 2000.
79
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
EU Ministers reached agreement in
February 1998 on the Fifth Framework
Programme for 1998-2002, covering
information technology, sustainable
development, energy and environment,
international research, innovation and small
and medium-sized enterprises, improving
research potential, and management of living
resources.
Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP)
The CFSP came into being with entry into
force of the Maastricht Treaty in November
1993. It is intergovernmental and provides for
EU member states to agree unanimously a
common foreign and security policy. Common
policies and/or joint actions have been agreed
on a wide range of international issues, lately
including:
• support for peace implementation in
former Yugoslavia;
• support for human rights, democratic
principles and good governance in Africa;
• work towards reconciliation and
protection of human rights in Rwanda;
and
• efforts to bring about a sustainable peace
in Afghanistan.
During the negotiations on the Amsterdam
Treaty, the UK pressed successfully for new
mechanisms to make the policy more effective.
The Treaty will introduce several key changes
including the appointment, unanimously by
the Council, of a High Representative to help
with the formulation, preparation and
presentation of CFSP policy decisions; and
the establishment of a Policy Planning and
Early Warning Unit in the Council Secretariat
to sharpen the preparation and focus of
common foreign policy decisions.
The Treaty is also introducing new
decision making rules. It preserves the
principle that all policy should be decided by
unanimity, but that decisions implementing
common strategies will be by qualified
majority voting. Under an ‘emergency brake’
procedure, a member state will be able to
prevent a vote being taken by qualified
majority voting for ‘important and stated
reasons of national policy’. Provision for
‘constructive abstention’ allows a member
state to abstain and stand aside from an EU
decision/action when its interests are not
engaged; this does not affect the right to veto.
The EU continues to look to the Western
European Union to handle defence issues
under the CFSP. The Amsterdam Treaty
provides for the ‘progressive framing of a
common defence policy’, in which the WEU
would support the EU. The WEU also
provides the EU with access to an operational
military capacity. The Treaty recognises that
NATO provides common defence for the UK
and its allies.
Interior and Justice Policy
The Maastricht Treaty established
intergovernmental arrangements for increased
co-operation among EU states on justice and
home affairs issues. A number of conventions
have been agreed under these arrangements,
including those on EUROPOL (see p. 88),
extradition and the protection of the European
Community’s financial interests.
In 1997 the European Council endorsed an
action plan to fight organised crime and to
increase international police and customs co¬
operation. Implementation of the plan,
including making participation in a criminal
organisation a criminal offence throughout the
Union, has been a priority of the UK
Presidency. EU member states and the
candidate member nations agreed in June 1998
to step up joint action to combat organised
crime.
CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
AND CENTRAL ASIA
European Security
With the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact
and the formation of democratically elected
governments in Central and Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, the European security
situation has been transformed. In 1990 the
UK and its NATO Allies, together with
former Warsaw Pact states, set up the North
Atlantic Co-operation Council (NACC) to
80
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
foster co-operation and understanding. Then,
in 1994, a NATO summit meeting invited the
non-NATO states in Central and Eastern
Europe and Central Asia to join a Partnership
for Peace, which, among other things, enlists
the Partners’ assistance in peacekeeping
operations and guides their armed forces
towards compatibility with those of NATO
countries.
The Partnership for Peace has grown
rapidly into a formidable and varied
programme of military and political co¬
operation. In mid-1997 the NACC agreed to
establish a new form of political consultation
called the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council
to develop political and military co-operation
between NATO countries and non-members.
The UK also played a major role in
negotiations leading to:
• the signature in May 1997 of a Founding
Act between NATO member states and
Russia, introducing new mechanisms for
a close and permanent relationship;
• a NATO-Ukraine Charter for a
Distinctive Partnership, also signed in
May 1997; and
• NATO’s decision, announced in July
1997, to invite the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland to negotiate
accession to NATO.
Economic Help
The UK and other Western countries are
taking action to help deal with the vast
economic problems following the fall of
Communism, and to promote the
development of market economies. The IMF
and World Bank, with the UK’s active
support, provide advice and finance to nearly
all countries in the region, while the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development
channels Western investment. The European
Union’s PHARE2 scheme is assisting Central
2 An aid programme for economic restructuring in Central
Europe, which consists of many individual projects and
operations to underpin the process of reform. It was initially
applicable to Poland and Hungary when first agreed in
1989, but has since been extended to other countries in
Central Europe.
European countries in the process of reform
and the development of infrastructure.
Countries of the former Soviet Union and
Mongolia receive help through a parallel
programme (TACIS),3 which concentrates on
financial services, transport, energy (including
nuclear safety) and humanitarian needs. The
UK’s Export Credit Guarantee Department
provides insurance cover for exporters to a
number of these countries.
Know How Fund
The Know How Fund is the UK’s
programme of bilateral technical assistance to
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
and Central Asia. It aims to support their
transition to pluralist democracy and a market
economy by the flexible provision of British
skills in a range of key sectors, such as finance,
energy and public administration, and by
encouraging UK investment in the region.
The UK spends about £90 million a year on
the programme.
Europe (Association) Agreements
The EU has strengthened relations with
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia and Slovenia by signing Europe
(Association) Agreements with them. The
agreements provide an institutional framework
to support the process of integration, and
anticipate accession of these countries to the
EU when they are able to assume the
obligations of membership. In February 1998
the agreements with the three Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania came into force.
The agreement with Slovenia has yet to come
into force, although the UK has completed its
own ratification procedures.
The EU has also signed partnership and
co-operation agreements with Russia (which
entered into force in December 1997),
Ukraine (March 1998), Moldova Quly 1998),
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and
3 An EU aid programme set up in 1990 to provide technical
assistance to recipient countries.
81
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Turkmenistan. A Trade and Co-operation
Agreement is in force with Albania. The
purpose of all these agreements is to reduce
trade barriers, develop wide-ranging co¬
operation and increase political dialogue
at all levels.
OTHER REGIONS
The Middle East
Middle East Peace Process
The UK supported the breakthrough in the
Middle East peace process in 1993, when
Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO) agreed to mutual
recognition and signed a Declaration of
Principles on interim self-government for the
Palestinians in Israeli-held territories occupied
in 1967. The first stage of the Declaration was
implemented in May 1994, when the
Palestinians adopted self-government in the
Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. A peace treaty
between Israel and Jordan was formally signed
in October 1994. The UK continues to
encourage peace negotiations between Israel,
Syria and Lebanon.
A further advance was achieved in
September 1995, when Israel and the PLO
reached an Interim Agreement providing for a
phased Israeli troop withdrawal from occupied
Palestinian areas of the West Bank and for
elections to a new Palestinian Council with
legislative and executive powers. The UK
took part in the EU-co-ordinated international
observation of the Palestinian elections in
January 1996.
Progress has since been far from smooth, in
part because of delays in implementing the
Interim Agreement, the continued expansion of
Israeli settlements in the occupied territories
and terrorist bomb attacks in Israel and
Jerusalem. During its Presidency of the EU the
UK sought to further the peace process,
complementing the efforts of the United States,
based on the conviction that a lasting resolution
must both protect Israel’s security and provide a
just exchange of land for peace.
The UK and other EU member states also
contribute to the peace process through the
provision of substantial aid to the Palestinians.
EU financial assistance between 1993 and
1998 has totalled some £290 million. Aid
programmes support Palestinian
administration, police training, the Palestinian
Monetary Authority, legal structures and the
judiciary, water management and healthcare.
The Gulf Conflict
As a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, the UK strongly condemned Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and
supported all Council resolutions designed to
force Iraqi withdrawal and restore
international legality. Because of Iraq’s failure
to withdraw, its forces were expelled in
February 1991 by an international coalition
led by the United States, the UK, France and
Saudi Arabia, acting under a UN mandate.
UN Security Council Resolution 661
imposed sanctions on Iraq in August 1990.
Resolution 687, adopted in April 1991,
formalised the ceasefire in the Gulf War and
stipulated conditions for Iraqi acceptance,
including measures to prevent the
development of weapons of mass destruction,
recognition of the border with Kuwait and the
payment of compensation to those who
suffered as a result of the invasion of Kuwait.
Sanctions remain in force (although not
against food or medical supplies) until the
Security Council is satisfied that Iraq is fully
in compliance with all relevant Security
Council resolutions.
As part of the agreement ending hostilities,
the Security Council authorised the creation
of a Special Commission (UNSCOM) to
supervise the elimination of Iraq’s weapons of
mass destruction. The UK has provided
considerable support to UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Authority in the
form of personnel, equipment and information
since the first inspection in 1991.
Consistent failure by the Iraqi regime to co¬
operate fully with UNSCOM led to the threat
of punitive military action by the United
States, backed by the UK, at the beginning of
1998. This willingness to use force, and the
diplomacy conducted through the UN
Secretary General, secured commitments in
February from the Iraqi government on
compliance with its obligations. UN Security
Council Resolution 1154, adopted in March,
82
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
warned that further Iraqi violations would
have the severest consequences.
The UK has been at the forefront of
diplomatic efforts to bring relief to the Iraqi
people. It co-sponsored a UN resolution
doubling the size of the ‘oil-for-food’
programme (under which Iraq may sell oil in
exchange for food, medicines and other
essential humanitarian supplies) and is the
second largest donor of humanitarian aid.
Asia-Pacific Region
The UK has good relations with Japan, China,
the Republic of Korea, many South East Asian
nations, Australia and New Zealand, and has
defence links with some countries in the region.
British commercial activity has developed
through increased trade and investment and the
setting up of business councils, joint
commissions or industrial co-operation
agreements. The UK is also taking advantage
of increased opportunities for English language
teaching, co-operation in science and
technology, and educational exchanges.
The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process
was inaugurated in Bangkok in 1996. The UK
hosted the second ASEM conference in
London in April 1998. ASEM is intended to
foster closer economic and political ties
between EU countries and Brunei, China,
Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines,
Thailand and Vietnam. Between them these
countries account for 50% of world gross
domestic product (GDP). The London
conference concentrated largely on the
problems of serious financial instability in
Asia, recognising the need for solidarity
between Europe and Asia in the increasingly
interdependent world economy. The first ever
EU-China summit, hosted by the British
Presidency, was held at the same time.
The UK’s relations with India and Pakistan
were affected when, in May 1998, both South
Asian countries conducted nuclear tests,
disregarding the global non-proliferation
regime (see p. 86) and undermining regional
security. The tests were almost universally
condemned. The permanent members of the
UN Security Council undertook to encourage
both parties to adopt practical measures to
prevent an arms race and to strengthen peace
and stability in the subcontinent.
In January 1998 Britain rejoined the South
Pacific Commission, having withdrawn from
membership in 1995. As the Pacific’s first
regional organisation, the Commission
provides technical advice and assistance to its
Pacific Island members, with which the UK
has longstanding and Commonwealth ties.
Links with the Pacific are reinforced by the
Lome Convention, which provides a
framework for relations (see p. 408).
Hong Kong
At the end of June 1997 the UK returned
Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty under the
provisions of the 1984 Sino-British Joint
Declaration, which contains guarantees about
Hong Kong’s way of life until at least 2047.
Hong Kong’s return to China was necessary
because of the expiry of the 99-year lease
under which the greater part of the territory
was transferred by China to Britain under the
1898 Peking Convention.
As set out in the Joint Declaration, Hong
Kong is a Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China. Apart from in foreign affairs
and defence, the Hong Kong SAR enjoys a
high degree of autonomy, maintaining its own
government. Its capitalist economy and
freedoms, including its social systems, will
remain intact for at least the next 50 years. The
Sino-British Liaison group will remain in
existence until 2000 to discuss matters relating
to the implementation of the Joint Declaration.
The UK is represented in Hong Kong by
its largest consulate-general in the world. As a
co-signatory of the Joint Declaration, it will
continue to have strong responsibilities
towards Hong Kong and the 3.5 million
British passport holders living there. In
addition, Hong Kong is the UK’s second
largest export market in Asia.
The Americas
The British Government believes that the
close transatlantic links between the UK, the
United States and Canada remain essential to
guarantee the security and prosperity of Europe
and North America.
83
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The UK and the US co-operate especially
closely on nuclear, defence and intelligence
matters. As founding members of NATO,
Britain and the US are deeply involved in
Western defence arrangements (see p. 97) and,
as permanent members of the UN Security
Council, work closely together on major
international issues. There are also important
economic links. The UK is the largest foreign
investor in the US, where about 1 million jobs
have been created by British investment worth
£82,500 million—nearly one quarter of all
overseas investment in the US. Over 40% of
US investment in Europe comes to the UK, a
share far bigger than to any other European
country. At a summit hosted by the UK
Presidency in May 1998, the EU and US
agreed a formula for resolving differences over
extraterritorial trading sanctions (against Iran
and Cuba). They also launched an initiative to
break down barriers to trade across the Atlantic
and to pursue multilateral liberalisation.
Strong links are maintained with Canada,
with whom the UK shares membership of the
Commonwealth, NATO and other key
international organisations. In 1997 the Prime
Ministers of Britain and Canada issued a joint
declaration to modernise and broaden the
bilateral relationship. The UK is the second
largest foreign investor in Canada and its third
largest trading partner.
Important British connections with Latin
America date from the participation of British
volunteers in the wars of independence in the
early 19th century. The UK has welcomed the
fact that democratically elected governments
are now the norm in the region; this, together
with the trend towards freer market economies,
has enabled Britain to strengthen its relations
with Latin American governments. The UK is
now one of the largest investors in the region
after the United States. During its EU
Presidency the UK took forward preparations
for a summit of EU, Latin American and
Caribbean states in 1999.
Southern Africa
Since the abolition of apartheid and the
election of President Mandela’s government in
1994, South Africa’s relations with the UK
have broadened into areas ranging from
development assistance to military advice, and
from sporting links to scientific co-operation.
There has also been a steady flow of state and
ministerial visits to and from South Africa.
The UK is South Africa’s largest single
trading partner, and largest foreign investor.
Both countries are committed to build on this
relationship by promoting the further
expansion of bilateral trade and investment.
During its Presidency of the European Union,
the UK advanced negotiations on an EU-
South Africa Free Trade Agreement.
PEACEKEEPING
The United Nations is the principal body
responsible for the maintenance of
international peace and security. In mid-1998
there were some 14,500 troops from 75 nations
deployed to 16 UN peacekeeping operations
around the world.
Britain and UN Peacekeeping
The UK makes a significant contribution to
UN peacekeeping, paying just over 6% of the
total annual costs. It deploys peacekeeping
troops in Cyprus, military observers in
Iraq/Kuwait, Georgia and Sierra Leone, and
police officers in Bosnia. A small number of
British military officers have been seconded to
the UN Secretariat’s Department of
Peacekeeping Operations in New York.
Cyprus
The UK has a contingent of about 300 troops
in the UN Force in Cyprus, established in
1964 to help prevent the recurrence of fighting
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Since
the hostilities of 1974, when Turkish forces
occupied the northern part of the island, the
Force has been responsible for monitoring the
ceasefire and control of a buffer zone between
the two communities.
Iraq/Kuwait
In 1991, Security Council Resolution 687
established a demilitarised zone extending
10 km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait to deter
violations of the boundary and to observe
84
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
hostile or potentially hostile actions. The UK,
with the other permanent members of the
Security Council, contributes 11 personnel to
the UN Iraq/Kuwait observer mission
(UNIKOM).
Georgia
The UK contributes up to 10 military
personnel to the UN Observer Mission in
Georgia, which was established in 1993. Its
mandate includes monitoring a ceasefire
between Georgian government troops and
rebels in the Georgian region of Abkhazia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
The UK supports the establishment of a
peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and is helping to implement
the Dayton Peace Agreement, signed in Paris
in 1995. The Stabilisation Force (SFOR),
around 34,000-strong in mid-1998, comprises
troops from all NATO nations and other
contributing countries, including Russia and a
number of other Partnership for Peace
members (see p. 81). The UK is the second
largest contributor to SFOR, providing about
4,800 troops and 350 other personnel. In
addition, 70 UK police officers are with the
UN International Police Task Force in
Bosnia.
The main task of SFOR is to ensure
continuing compliance with the military
aspects of the Dayton Agreement, including
monitoring the actions of the armed forces and
inspecting weapon sites. It also provides broad
support to the main organisations responsible
for the civil aspects of the Agreement,
including the Office of the High
Representative, the International Police Task
Force, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, and the OSCE. Although the
military requirements of the Dayton
Agreement have largely been met, many of the
civil aspects have yet to be fully implemented.
The UK is assisting the International
Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, which was
set up to try those indicted for war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia. With other SFOR
contributors, British forces have detained
several of those indicted; they are now
awaiting trial in the Tribunal’s detention
centre. Although governments in the region
are responsible for arresting suspects and
handing them over to the Tribunal, in most
cases they have failed to do so. As well as
supporting the Tribunal through the
provision of staff, information and forensic
science expertise, the UK has provided funds
to establish a second courtroom in The Hague.
The UK has provided over ^400 million in
humanitarian and reconstruction aid
(bilaterally and through the EU) to Bosnia
since 1992.
Kosovo
Since February 1998 there has been
increasing international concern over the
serious escalation of violence in the province
of Kosovo in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY—comprising Serbia and
Montenegro) and its implications for regional
stability in south-eastern Europe. Excessive
repression by Serbian security forces against
the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian civilian
population, and terrorism by elements of the
Kosovar population, have prompted
widespread condemnation and calls for a
peaceful solution based on territorial
integrity of the FRY and autonomy for
Kosovo. The UN Security Council adopted
an arms embargo against the FRY in March
and the EU and the United States tightened
economic sanctions in response to the
repression in Kosovo. In September 1998 the
UN Security Council adopted a further
resolution demanding that all parties end
hostilities, maintain a ceasefire, and start
discussions aimed at securing long-term peace
and stability. The UK and its NATO
partners threatened to intervene militarily if
the Serbian offensive in Kosovo was not
stopped.
ARMS CONTROL
Because of the global reach of modern
weapons, the UK has a clear national interest
in preventing proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and promoting international
control.
85
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Weapons of Mass Destruction
Nuclear Weapons
The main instrument for controlling nuclear
weapons is the 1968 Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The UK is a
depositary of the NPT, and took an active
part in securing its indefinite extension in
1995. It also played an important role in
negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), which it signed in 1996 and
ratified in April 1998. The CTBT, with its
permanent verification system, will come into
force when it has been ratified by 44 named
states. The British Government is pressing
for negotiation of a treaty banning future
production of fissile material for use in
nuclear weapons.
While large nuclear arsenals and risks of
proliferation remain, the UK’s minimum
nuclear deterrent remains a necessary and
continuing element of British security. The
UK’s nuclear capability, and the conclusions
of the Government’s Strategic Defence
Review, are described in chapter 8.
Biological Weapons
The UK is playing a leading part in
promoting the 1972 Biological Weapons
Convention, which provides for a worldwide
ban on such weapons. Unfortunately, there is
no effective verification mechanism. It is
leading international efforts to formulate such
measures for inclusion in a Protocol to the
Convention. These include mandatory
declarations of key facilities and challenge
inspections to address concerns about possible
non-compliance.
Chemical Weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which came into force in 1997, provides for a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons. The
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons is responsible for verification.
During the negotiations the UK made major
contributions to drawing up extensive and
effective verification provisions. All the
necessary British legislation is in place to
license the production, possession and use of
the most toxic chemicals and to implement the
Convention’s trade controls.
Conventional Weapons
The UK and its NATO partners have ratified
a number of agreements whose purpose is to
enhance security and stability in Europe. The
UK is committed to work with its Allies and
other European countries to develop and
improve these agreements in the light of the
changing security environment.
The main agreements are:
• the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE) Treaty, which reduces
and limits the numbers of heavy weapons
in the countries of NATO and the former
Warsaw Pact, and includes a verification
regime. The CFE Treaty is widely
regarded as a linchpin of European
security; over 50,000 heavy weapons have
been destroyed by the treaty signatories;
• the Vienna Document, developed under
the auspices of the OSCE, which is a
binding agreement by 54 states on the
promotion of stability and openness on
military matters in Europe; it contains a
wide range of confidence and security
building measures, including verification
arrangements; and
• the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which,
when it comes into force, will provide for
the overflight and photography of the
entire territory of the 27 participating
states to monitor their military
capabilities and activities. The treaty
awaits ratification by Russia, Belarus and
Ukraine.
In 1991 the UK was instrumental in
establishing the UN Register of Conventional
Arms, which came into effect in 1992. This
aims to introduce greater transparency in
international transfers of conventional arms
and to help identify excessive arms build-ups
in any one country or region. The UK
Government has pledged to strengthen the
Register by encouraging greater disclosure of
information on arms exports and arms
transfers by all countries.
86
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Landmines
The UK signed the Ottawa Convention
banning the use, production, trade, transfer
and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines in
December 1997. In July 1998 it became the
28th state to ratify the Convention, which will
enter into force six months after the 40th state
has ratified. The UK is on target to destroy its
stocks of such mines well in advance of the
Convention’s deadline of four years after entry
into force.
The UK has a programme to support
humanitarian demining activities, which is
focused on helping affected countries develop
the capacity to clear landmines and improving
the co-ordination of international demining
resources.
Export Controls
The UK plays a leading role in all of the
international control regimes which govern
the export of conventional arms, technology
associated with weapons of mass destruction
and ‘dual-use’ goods (those having a legitimate
civil use as well as a potential military
application).
In July 1997 the British Government issued
new criteria for assessing licence applications
for arms exports, one of the provisions of
which is that licences will not be granted if
there is a clearly identifiable risk that weapons
might be used for internal repression or
international aggression. At the same time it
banned the export of certain equipment for
which there is clear evidence that it has been
used for torture or other abuses; it also
declared its commitment to preventing British
companies from manufacturing, selling or
procuring such equipment and to pressing for
a global ban.
In June 1998 EU Foreign Ministers
reached agreement on a European Union
Code of Conduct setting high common
standards to govern conventional arms exports
from all EU countries.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The UK Government has stated its
commitment to working for improvements in
human rights standards across the world. In
April 1998 it published its first annual human
rights report, describing the activities and
initiatives pursued during the previous year.
These include:
• making human rights a central part of the
development programme (see p. 90);
• driving forward negotiations for the
establishment of an effective
International Criminal Court to try the
most serious crimes of international
concern, such as genocide, crimes against
humanity and war crimes;
• revising the criteria for arms sales (see
above); and
• launching a new £5 million fund for
human rights projects around the world.
International Conventions
United Nations
Universal respect for human rights is an
obligation under the UN Charter. Expressions
of concern about human rights do not,
therefore, constitute interference in the
internal affairs of another state.
The UK Government promotes the
standards set out in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which was adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948. Since this is
not a legally binding document, the General
Assembly adopted two international covenants
in 1966, placing legal obligations on those states
ratifying or acceding to them. The covenants
came into force in 1976, the UK ratifying both
in the same year. One covenant deals with
economic, social and cultural rights and the
other with civil and political rights. States
which are parties to the covenants undertake to
submit periodic reports detailing compliance
with their terms. Each covenant has a treaty
monitoring body which examines these reports.
The UK recognises the competence of these
bodies to receive and consider state-to-state
complaints. Other international instruments to
which the UK is a party include those on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
87
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
• the rights of the child;
• torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
• the prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery; and
• the status of refugees.
Council of Europe
The UK is also bound by the Council of
Europe’s Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,
which covers:
• the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
• the right to marry and have a family;
• freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
• freedom of expression, including
freedom of the press;
• freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
• the right to have a sentence reviewed by a
higher tribunal; and
• the prohibition of torture and inhuman
or degrading treatment.
The Government is incorporating the main
provisions of the Convention into UK law,
enabling individuals in the UK to use the
human rights provision of the Convention in
cases before the British courts, and not just
before the European Court of Human Rights
in Strasbourg.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (in Warsaw) is
responsible for monitoring elections and
promoting participating states’ adherence to
commitments on human rights, democracy
and the rule of law. It provides a forum for
meetings and expert seminars to discuss the
implementation of such commitments. The
Office shares information on the building of
democratic institutions and the holding of
elections in participating states. It also
provides expertise and training on
constitutional and legal matters.
Westminster Foundation for Democracy
The Westminster Foundation for Democracy,
an independent non-departmental public body
established in 1992, provides assistance in
building and strengthening pluralist
democratic institutions overseas. It receives an
annual grant from the FCO and raises funds
through donations from other organisations.
The three main political parties (see p. 42) are
represented on the Foundation’s Board of
Governors. Efforts are being concentrated on
Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and
Central Asia, and Anglophone Africa.
CRIME AND TERRORISM
The UK maintains a substantial programme
of overseas assistance to combat drug
trafficking, and British law enforcement
agencies have posted drugs liaison officers in
over 50 UK missions throughout the world to
develop operational co-operation with the host
authorities. Working with its EU partners, the
UK is helping Caribbean states to reduce the
transit of drugs from Latin America to
Europe; supporting the Central Asian states
with practical projects to stem the heroin
supply route from Afghanistan; and tackling
money laundering. The UK has long played
an active role in the United Nations drug
control structure, and is the second largest
contributor to the UN International Drug
Control Programme. The UK had a co¬
ordinating role on behalf of the EU in
discussions at the UN General Assembly
Special Session on Drugs in June 1998.
The UK and its EU partners are tackling
serious and organised international crime
through, for example, the establishment of the
European Police Office (EUROPOL) to
support investigations and operations
conducted by national law enforcement
agencies. EUROPOL powers and duties are
set out in the EUROPOL Convention, which
entered into force on 1 October 1998. EU
member states also belong to the International
Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).
British liaison with INTERPOL is provided
88
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
by the National Criminal Intelligence Service
(see p. 219).
The UK Government has stressed its
condemnation of all terrorist acts, its
opposition to concessions to terrorist
demands, and its commitment to ensuring that
terrorists do not benefit from their acts. It
works bilaterally with other like-minded
governments, and multilaterally through the
UN, EU and G8, to promote closer
international co-ordination against terrorism.
The UK is party to 11 international counter¬
terrorism conventions agreed between 1963
and 1991, and in January 1998 became one of
the first countries to sign the new United
Nations Convention on the Suppression of
Terrorist Bombings.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The Department for International
Development (DFID) manages the UK’s
bilateral and multilateral development
assistance programmes in poor countries, and,
through the Know How Fund (see p. 81),
supports the transition process in the states of
Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
DFID also has wider responsibilities in trade,
debt and environmental policies and their
impact on developing countries.
In 1996—97 UK gross public expenditure
on development assistance amounted to nearly
£2,408 million. About 43% of this was spent
multilaterally, with £626 million channelled
through the European Community, £233
million through the World Bank and other
development banks, £137 million through the
UN and Commonwealth, and £45 million
through other multilateral institutions.
Bilateral aid to individual countries accounted
for the rest. On a regional basis, most UK aid
expenditure was directed towards Africa
(40%) and Asia (37%).
The Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC), currently a statutory
corporation owned by the British
Government, is the UK’s main instrument for
stimulating private sector investment in the
poorer countries of the world. From its own
resources, it finances around £300 million
worth of new activities a year, of which over
30% is for projects in sub-Saharan Africa.
The CDC is to be reorganised into a new
partnership between the public and private
sectors, with the Government retaining a
substantial minority holding. Proceeds from
selling the majority share will be reinvested in
the development programme.
Some of the aid budget goes to programmes
administered by non-governmental
organisations such as Oxfam and Save the
Children Fund.
Eliminating World Poverty
A White Paper on international development,
the first for 22 years, was published in
November 1997. Eliminating World Poverty: A
Challenge for the 21st Century sets out a new
approach, refocusing the UK aid effort on the
elimination of poverty and the encouragement
of economic growth which benefits the poor
through support for international
development targets and policies.
The internationally agreed development
targets to which the Government subscribes
are:
• a reduction by 50% in the proportion of
people living in extreme poverty by 2015;
• universal primary education in all
countries by 2015;
• demonstrated progress towards gender
equality and the empowerment of women
by 2005;
• significant reductions in infant, child and
maternal mortality by 2015;
• access to reproductive health services for
all individuals of appropriate ages no
later than 2015; and
• the implementation of national strategies
for sustainable development in all
countries by 2005, with the aim of
reversing current trends in the loss of
environmental resources at both global
and national levels by 2015.
To these ends the UK Government is:
• building new partnerships with
developing countries, multilateral
development organisations, the private
and voluntary sectors, and the research
community;
89
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
• ensuring that environmental, trade,
investment and agricultural policies
affecting developing countries take
account of the sustainable development
objective;
• giving particular attention to human
rights, transparent and accountable
government and core labour standards;
• promoting political stability and social
cohesion; and
• encouraging financial stability and the
reduction of the external debt of
developing countries to sustainable
levels.
The White Paper reaffirms the UK’s
commitment to meeting the UN target for
official development assistance of 0.7% of
gross national product (GNP).4
Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods
The Government considers that the
elimination of poverty depends on the
promotion of sustainable livelihoods for poor
people. This requires strong economic
growth, combined with economic and social
policies based on a commitment to eradicating
poverty.
Sound Economic Management
The UK works in partnership with
governments of developing countries, and
other bilateral and multilateral donors, in
promoting sound economic management,
including well-founded monetary and fiscal
policies in support of strong, broad-based,
economic growth. A large part of the UK
programme in Africa is devoted to sound
economic management, and progress has been
made in sustaining growth which benefits
poor people in, for example, Uganda, Ghana,
Mozambique and Malawi.
UK bilateral support is often targeted at
building revenue-raising capacity and
strengthening the budget processes and
4 UK expenditure on development assistance is planned to
increase from 0.26% of GNP in 1997 to 0.3% by 2001.
financial management systems in the Ministry
of Finance of a given developing country.
This is a significant element of the UK
programme in some South Asian countries,
such as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Emphasis is
increasingly placed on development assistance
at the sector level—for example, health,
education and agriculture—to improve the
allocation and use of resources both of
developing country governments and of
donors.
This work is complemented by support for
the establishment of efficient, well-regulated
markets to which the poor have access to sell
their produce and buy the goods they need.
The promotion of efficient markets is equally
important on both a domestic and an
international level. Where the state has
traditionally assumed the role of providing
infrastructure utilities, the UK has worked
with developing country governments and
donors to introduce market mechanisms into
this provision—for example, in the power
generation sector in Orissa state in India, and
in the telecommunications sector in Jordan.
Improving Access to Land
Improving limited or insecure access to land
for poor people is an important component of
British aid programmes, since land tenure
arrangements are seen as a significant
determinant of poverty. The UK is
encouraging land reform programmes in
South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, and in
several Eastern European countries, and an
advisory Land Tenure Group within DFID
has been established. In addition to supporting
changes in land ownership structure, Britain is
aiming to improve access to resources such as
credit, advice and investment, and helping to
develop better market structures to allow
those involved in agriculture the opportunity
to build up profitable and sustainable
businesses.
Good Government and Human Rights
Assistance for good government is a priority
for the UK aid programme on the grounds
that successful development will be impossible
without it.
90
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Civil service reform is central to the role of
the state in delivering services to its citizens.
The UK is funding projects to this end in
several African countries including Ghana,
Malawi and Tanzania, and also in Jamaica,
Poland and Slovakia. Bringing government
closer to the people is also part of better
government. An example of UK support in
this area is a programme in Vietnam to make
district and provincial people’s authorities
more aware of, and responsive to, the needs of
poor people.
Six of the UK’s 13 remaining Overseas
Territories (see p. 74) continue to receive
substantial British development assistance, to
help meet basic needs but also to promote
good governance. Support has been provided
to Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands and the
Turks and Caicos Islands for restructuring
their public services, training personnel for
their public administration, and developing
modern legal frameworks through law revision
and reform.
Reorienting the police from a force to a
service, and implementing community
policing, is also encouraged through the UK
aid effort; the largest project along these lines
is taking place in Zimbabwe.
UK development assistance policy now
places greater emphasis on human rights. The
Government is supporting poor and
disadvantaged people against violations of
their rights, and taking affirmative action to
help them assert those rights. It is committed
to comprehensive implementation of the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and is
also working with its partners, including the
private sector and the International Labour
Organisation, to eradicate intolerable forms of
child labour. The Ethical Trading Initiative is
a collaboration between business and the
voluntary sector in the UK to develop local
monitoring of labour standards in developing
countries.
Promoting Opportunities for Women
Addressing gender inequalities, and
supporting specific initiatives for women’s
advancement, are integral to UK development
policies and programmes. Examples of
positive measures include helping to expand
girls’ access to education in various countries,
supporting a self-financing rural savings and
credit scheme for poor women in Bangladesh,
and providing training on women’s rights for
organisations in Hungary.
Debt Relief
The British Government considers that debt
reduction, if combined with sensible economic
policies, can play a key role in creating the
right conditions for sustained economic
growth in developing countries. The UK has
initiated a number of schemes for debt relief,
for example, the Commonwealth Debt
Initiative launched in 1997, under which
Britain has recently agreed to cancel the aid
debts of Barbados, Dominica, Grenada,
Mauritius, St Lucia, Tonga and the Turks
and Caicos Islands.
The Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Debt Initiative aims to resolve the
problems of unsustainable debt burden faced
by some poor nations. Through this, the
British Government is contributing about
£6.5 million to help meet the cost of reducing
Uganda’s debts to the African Development
Bank.
Education
Education has been declared a priority by the
British Government, as much in its
international development programme as in its
domestic agenda. It is estimated that 150
million of the world’s primary-age children do
not go to school at all; hence the international
target of achieving universal primary
education in all countries by 2015.
In 1997-98 the UK committed more than
£100 million in support for education
programmes in India, South Africa, Malawi
and Kenya. Additional help is being extended
in 1998-99 to programmes in Uganda,
Tanzania, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ghana and
Namibia. The Government also wants to
ensure that everybody has access to education
at all levels, particularly women and girls,
with the aim of eliminating gender inequalities
in both primary and secondary education
by 2005.
91
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Literacy and access to information are a
prerequisite of development. However, over
900 million adults in the world—two-thirds of
them women—are illiterate. The UK backs a
number of initiatives to promote better access
to education including, for example, support
for Commonwealth programmes directed at
literacy training for adults, and a project in
South Africa managed by Book Aid
International, which provides textbooks to
resource centres, community libraries and
schools in three provinces.
Health
Basic healthcare for all, particularly poor
people, is another commitment of the British
aid effort. UK spending on primary healthcare
as a percentage of total bilateral aid has risen
from 3% to 8% over the last six years. The
provision of essential healthcare covers
immunisation and nutritional supplements,
public education for family planning and
AIDS prevention.
The Government also supports initiatives
on specific health issues, for example,
contributing £43 million to a multi-agency
programme to eradicate polio from India by
the year 2000 and working with national
governments and other bilateral agencies on a
programme to control onchocerciasis (river
blindness) in West Africa.
It is estimated that 1,300 million people in
the world do not have access to safe water.
The UK plans to increase support for
programmes which bring clean water to poor
people and take account of the impact of water
use on social and economic development. The
Government also backs international efforts
through the UN, other agencies and bilaterally
to implement sustainable integrated water
planning and management. For example,
Britain is helping in the development of a
comprehensive management strategy for
national water resources in Zimbabwe.
The Environment
Sustainable Development
Conservation and sustainable management of
the natural environment, while meeting the
needs of poor communities for food, water,
land, shelter, energy, transport and
employment, are key aims of the British aid
programme.
The UK supports sustainable systems of
agricultural production and aquaculture,
where the emphasis is on increasing the
incomes of small-scale producers through
systems which maintain or improve the
productivity of land or water resources. It also
encourages community-based approaches to
the management of common property
resources, such as forests, grazing land, lakes
and rivers. When sustainably managed, forests
can be an invaluable resource for communities
in developing countries and represent a major
habitat for biological diversity. Forests are also
important for the world’s climate, since trees
absorb carbon dioxide, a gas which contributes
to global warming.
The development of wildlife management
and wildlife parks can directly benefit local
people—through tourism, for example, which
brings employment opportunities and foreign
exchange. DFID has offered help to the
Kenya Wildlife Service in its efforts to balance
the needs of local people with the management
of wildlife parks.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is
a trust fund which helps developing countries
and countries with economies in transition to
meet the additional costs of global
environmental actions in four main areas:
climate change; biodiversity; pollution of
water; and ozone depletion (for countries in
transition only).
The UK has, to date, committed £130
million to the Fund and is its fifth largest
donor. Donors have agreed to a target of
$2,750 million for the second stage of the
Facility.
Climate Change
DFID represented the EU on developing
country issues as part of the UK delegation to
the meeting of the Climate Change
Convention in Kyoto, Japan, in December
1997 (see also p. 336). This agreed a protocol
that commits developed countries as a whole
to reducing their emissions of greenhouse
gases, and reaffirmed the GEF as the means
92
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
by which developing countries can be helped
to meet their obligations.
Ozone Depletion
DFID makes the UK’s contribution to the
Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol
(see p. 338), which helps developing countries
to meet some of the extra costs of phasing out
ozone-depleting substances.
Energy
In many developing countries, energy
shortages are a constraint to investment in job-
creating enterprises and to production. The
UK aims to increase access to appropriate
forms of energy, while minimising the effects
on the environment. This involves measures
to reduce wastage and to encourage greater use
of renewable sources of energy, especially
where this benefits the poorest communities.
Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs
The UK’s objectives in helping countries to
deal with man-made or natural disasters are
not only to save lives, through the provision of
financial, material and technical assistance to
those affected, but also to protect and rebuild
communities and livelihoods and make them
less vulnerable to future hazards. Given the
large number of organisations involved in
international humanitarian work, the UK
Government is pressing for a more consistent
and efficient system of providing multilateral
humanitarian assistance.
By May 1998 some £65.2 million worth of
emergency relief, development assistance and
budgetary aid had been committed by the
Government to the UK Overseas Territory of
Montserrat since a period of devastating
volcanic activity started in 1995. This has
covered the establishment of emergency air
and sea links, maintenance of power and water
supplies, housing for those displaced, and help
with education and health facilities. In
addition, assistance has been provided for
people relocating from Montserrat to the UK,
Antigua and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN
POLICY
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
is in charge of overall foreign policy. It is
headed by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary, who is responsible for the work of
the FCO and the Diplomatic Service (see p.
58), which provides the staffs of British
diplomatic and consular posts overseas. British
diplomatic missions also employ some 7,800
locally engaged staff. Staff overseas deal with
political, commercial and economic work;
entry clearance to the UK and consular work;
aid administration; and information and other
activities, such as culture, science and
technology.
The FCO’s executive agency, Wilton Park
International Conference Centre in West
Sussex, contributes to the solution of
international problems by organising
conferences in the UK, attended by
politicians, business people, academics and
other professionals from all over the world.
An important function of the FCO is to
promote understanding of British foreign
policies and to project an up-to-date image of
the UK worldwide, beyond the reaches of
government-to-government diplomacy. Key
elements of FCO-funded public
communication work include:
• publications, television and radio
programmes, the FCO-On-Line website
(see Further Reading), British Satellite
News (used regularly by at least 170
television stations worldwide to
supplement their news coverage) and
various other information initiatives;
• scholarship schemes for overseas
students (see p. 144) and programmes for
influential foreign visitors;
• the BBC World Service (see p. 276); and
• the British Council (see p. 94).
Other Departments
Several other government departments are
closely involved with foreign policy issues.
The Department for International
93
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Development administers the UK’s
development programmes. The Ministry of
Defence maintains military liaison with the
UK’s NATO and other allies. The
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has
an important influence on international trade
policy and commercial relations with other
countries, including EU member states. The
FCO and DTI work together on export and
investment promotion initiatives that focus on
the needs of British industry. HM Treasury is
involved in British international economic
policy and is responsible for the UK’s
relations with the World Bank and other
international financial institutions. British EU
policy is co-ordinated through the Cabinet
Office European Secretariat.
CULTURAL RELATIONS
The British Council is the UK’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas. Its
purpose is to promote a wider knowledge of
the UK and the English language and to
encourage cultural, scientific, technological
and educational co-operation between the UK
and other countries. Its work also supports the
FCO’s objective of increasing respect and
goodwill for the UK. The Council:
• helps people to study, train or make
professional contacts in the UK;
• enables British specialists to teach, advise
or establish joint projects abroad;
• teaches English and promotes its use;
• provides library and information services;
• promotes scientific and technical
training, research collaboration and
exchanges; and
• encourages appreciation of British arts
and literature.
The Council works in 230 towns and cities
in 109 countries. It runs 220 libraries and
information centres which have about 440,000
members borrowing over 9 million books,
videos and tapes each year. The Council
supports over 9,000 scientific visits and some
1,300 research links. It also administers over
500,000 British professional and academic
examinations each year. The Council is
financed partly by a grant from the FCO and
partly by income from revenue-earning
activities such as English language teaching,
the administration of examinations and
bilateral and international aid contract work.
The training and education programmes
organised by the Council as part of the British
aid programme receive funding from DFID.
One third of the Council’s income comes from
other earnings such as fees earned from
administration of examinations or from
English language teaching.
Educational Exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by
British experts, encourages cultural exchange
visits, and organises academic interchange
between British universities and colleges and
those in other countries.
The British aid programme has helped
fund certain Council programmes, such as:
• recruitment of staff for overseas
universities;
• secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments; and
• organisation of short-term teaching and
advisory visits.
The Council’s Central Bureau for
Educational Visits and Exchanges focuses on
education for international understanding
through partnerships between educational
establishments, curriculum-related exchange
programmes, and workshops and conferences
related to professional international
experience. Information is also provided on
work, study and travel opportunities
worldwide. The Bureau is government-
funded and is the national agency in the UK
for many EU education and training
programmes.
The Arts
The British Council initiates or supports
3,000 events each year with its international
partners in the fields of the performing arts,
film and television, visual arts, literature and
design. These activities include British
participation in major international festivals

and biennials, tours and exhibitions, special
showcases of British work for international
promoters, and a programme of professional

Britain’s defence policy supports its wider security policy, which is to maintain
the country’s freedom and territorial integrity, and that of its Overseas
Territories, as well as its ability to pursue its legitimate interests at home and
abroad. As a member of NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), the UK
makes a significant contribution to maintaining stability throughout Europe.
STRATEGIC DEFENCE REVIEW
The Government’s Strategic Defence Review,
published in July 1998, assessed the UK’s
security interests and defence requirements
and examined how the roles, missions and
capabilities of the armed forces needed to be
adjusted to meet new strategic realities.
With the end of the Cold War, the UK’s
security environment has been transformed.
There is now considered to be no immediate
prospect of a major war in Europe and no
external threat to the UK and its western
European allies or to its Overseas Territories.
The present circumstances therefore have
important implications for the shape of the
armed forces. With no requirement for large
forces on the Continent or in the Atlantic simply
to defend the UK and its Allies, the opportunity
can be taken both to reduce the scale of the UK’s
armed forces and to employ them on a wider
range of tasks in support of foreign and security
policies. This does, however, require changes to
the balance of military capabilities.
The Cold War has been replaced by a
complex mixture of uncertainty, instability
and potential threats to British security: for
example, terrorism, the international drug
trade, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons, ethnic and religious
rivalry, and the break-up of existing states. In
this new environment, there is an increasing
need for the capability to assist, with other
states, in preventing or containing
international crises, if necessary by deploying
military forces rapidly to deal with them
(Bosnia and the Gulf are two recent examples).
The Strategic Defence Review sets out a
range of initiatives designed to meet the new
circumstances. Central to the Review’s
conclusions is the need for a more integrated,
joint-service approach to defence, to improve
the operational effectiveness of the armed
forces (see p. 101).
The planned changes are designed to
reinforce the UK’s continuing commitment to
international peace and security through
NATO and the Western European Union
96
DEFENCE
(WEU—see p. 71), and through other
international organisations such as the United
Nations (UN—see p. 69) and the Organisation
for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE—see p. 73).
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANISATION
The UK is a founding member of NATO,
which was established in 1949 and is the only
forum binding North America to European
defence arrangements. It currently has 16
members. Most of the UK’s forces are
assigned to NATO.
Adaptation of NATO
As part of its continuous post-Cold War
evolution, NATO has pursued a number of
initiatives, including: the Partnership for
Peace; the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council;
the NATO/Russia Founding Act; the
NATO-Ukraine Charter; and the enlargement
of NATO to include the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland in 1999 (see pp. 80-1).
NATO is also developing the Combined
Joint Task Force. This concept is designed to
strengthen the Alliance’s ability to command
and control multinational and multiservice
forces, deployed at short notice, which can
conduct a wide range of operations, including
peacekeeping. It will also facilitate
participation by non-NATO nations in
operations (as is already happening in
Bosnia—see p. 85), and, by enabling the
conduct of such operations to be led by the
WEU, will contribute to the development of
the European Security and Defence Identity
(ESDI) within NATO. Under ESDI, NATO
assets and capabilities could be made available
for WEU operations. The aim is to permit the
creation of coherent and effective forces that
can operate under the political control and
strategic direction of the WEU.
Outreach
In addition to its work with NATO on the
Partnership for Peace, the UK has its own
Outreach initiative of bilateral defence co¬
operation with countries from eastern and
central Europe. Outreach also covers civilian
areas of interest, ranging from English
language training to specialist medical skills
and environmental management. In 1998, over
1,000 individual activities took place with 24
countries. The focus and scope of the
programme complements and helps to
underpin the Partnership for Peace.
BRITISH DEFENCE POLICY
British defence policy is designed to support
foreign and security policies. Its aims are:
• to deter any threats to, and, if necessary,
defend the freedom and territorial
integrity of the UK and its Overseas
Territories, including the provision of
support, as necessary, for the civil
authorities in countering terrorism;
• to contribute to the promotion of the
UK’s wider security interests, including
the protection of freedom, democratic
institutions and free trade; and
• thus to promote peace and help maximise
the UK’s international prestige and
influence.
The Strategic Defence Review has revised the
core missions which underpin the UK’s
defence planning. These are:
• peacetime security, which includes counter¬
terrorism as the highest priority, but might
also involve assisting in the evacuation of
British (and other) citizens caught up in
overseas crises, or specialised support to
civil authorities, for example in countering
drug-related crime;
• security of the Overseas Territories,
including the provision of garrisons in
the Falklands and Gibraltar;
• defence diplomacy, involving arms control,
non-proliferation and related security¬
building measures, enhanced Outreach
programmes in eastern Europe, and
wider education and training initiatives to
help develop democratically accountable
forces around the world;
• support for wider British interests,
including military assistance and
97
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
training, which have a valuable role in
demonstrating the UK’s commitment to
international friendships worldwide;
• peace support and humanitarian operations,
to strengthen the effectiveness of the
international community in these areas,
by making a larger proportion of the
front-line forces potentially available to
the UN for such contingencies;
• responding to a regional conflict outside the
NA TO area, which might involve major
combat operations as well as deterrent
deployments;
• responding to a regional conflict inside the
NATO area, in which Alliance members
might be threatened; and
• responding to a strategic attack on NA TO,
which requires a credible nuclear
deterrent (see p. 100) and the retention of
a capability to rebuild larger forces over a
longer period should a strategic threat to
NATO re-emerge.
The UK and its Overseas Territories
The armed forces are responsible for
safeguarding the UK’s territory, airspace and
territorial waters. They provide for the
security and reinforcement, as necessary, of
the Overseas Territories and, when required,
support for the civil authorities in both the
UK and the Overseas Territories.
Maritime Defence
The Royal Navy aims to ensure the integrity
of British territorial waters and the protection
of British rights and interests in the
surrounding seas. The maintenance of a 24-
hour, year-round presence in British waters is
designed to provide reassurance to merchant
ships and other mariners. The Royal Air
Force (RAF) also contributes to maritime
requirements, for instance through the
Nimrod force, which provides air surveillance
of surface vessels and submarines.
Land Defence
Army units committed to the defence of the
UK, its Overseas Territories and the
Sovereign Bases in Cyprus include 21 Regular
Infantry battalions and seven Home Service
battalions. Tasks include contributing to the
security of national and NATO nuclear forces,
military support to the machinery of
government in war, military aid to the civil
power throughout the UK and its Overseas
Territories, maintaining the security of the
Overseas Territories and State ceremonial and
public duties.
Air Defence
Air defence of the UK and the surrounding
seas is maintained by a system of layered
defences. Continuous radar cover is provided
by the United Kingdom Air Defence Ground
Environment (UKADGE), supplemented by
the NATO Airborne Early Warning Force, to
which the RAF contributes six E-3D aircraft.
The RAF also provides five squadrons of all-
weather Tornado F3 air defence aircraft,
supported by tanker aircraft and, in wartime,
an additional F3 squadron. Royal Navy air
defence destroyers can be also linked to the
UKADGE, providing radar and electronic
warfare coverage and surface-to-air missiles.
Ground-launched Rapier missiles defend the
main RAF bases. Naval aircraft also contribute
to British air defence.
Overseas Garrisons
The UK maintains garrisons in Gibraltar, the
Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus, the Falkland
Islands and Brunei. Gibraltar provides
headquarters and communications facilities for
NATO in the western Mediterranean, while
Cyprus provides essential strategic
communications facilities as well as being a
valuable base for operations in the eastern
Mediterranean and beyond. The garrison on the
Falkland Islands, which has been in place since
1982, guarantees the security of the Islands and
other UK territories in the South Atlantic. The
garrison in Brunei is maintained at the request of
the Brunei government. In addition, a British
military presence is maintained in Belize in the
form of a jungle training support unit.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces are still providing support
to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in
98
DEFENCE
maintaining law and order and countering
terrorism. Up to 18 major units are assigned to
Northern Ireland, including six Home Service
battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment. The
number of units deployed to the Province at
any one time is dependent on the prevailing
security situation. The Royal Navy patrols
territorial waters around Northern Ireland and
its inland waterways in order to deter and
intercept the movement of terrorist weapons.
The Royal Marines provide troops to meet
Navy and Army commitments, while the RAF
provides elements of the RAF Regiment and
Chinook, Wessex and Puma helicopters.
Other Tasks
Other tasks include the provision of:
• military assistance to civil ministries, for
example in maintaining the essentials of
life in the community, providing fishery
protection duties and helping in the fight
against drugs;
• military aid to the civil community,
including during emergencies; and
• military search and rescue.
Britain and its Allies
The foundation of Britain’s defence is
provided through its membership of NATO.
Maritime Forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO and are available for WEU and
peacekeeping operations. Permanent
contributions are made to NATO’s Immediate
Reaction and Rapid Reaction Forces in the
Atlantic, the English Channel and the
Mediterranean. The UK also contributes to
NATO’s Maritime Augmentation Forces,
which are held at the lowest state of readiness
and in peacetime comprise ships mainly in
routine refit or maintenance.
The main components of the Fleet are:
• three aircraft carriers operating Sea
Harrier aircraft and Sea King anti¬
submarine helicopters;
• 35 destroyers and frigates;
• 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines;
• amphibious forces, including two assault
ships and a new helicopter carrier, which
entered service in 1998.
For information on Britain’s independent
nuclear deterrent see p. 100.
Land Forces
The multinational Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is the key land
component of NATO’s Rapid Reaction
Forces. Britain is the ‘framework nation’ for
the Corps. Capable of deploying up to four
NATO divisions, the ARRC is commanded by
a British general, and some 55,000 British
regular troops are assigned to it, including the
UK’s contribution of some 60% of the
headquarters staff and Corps level combat
support and combat service support units.
Britain also provides two of the ten divisions
available to the Corps—an armoured division
of three armoured brigades stationed in
Germany, and a mechanised division of two
mechanised brigades and an airborne brigade
based in Britain. An air-mobile brigade,
assigned to one of the Corps’ two multi¬
national divisions, is also located in Britain.
Air Forces
The RAF makes a major contribution to
NATO’s Immediate and Rapid Reaction
Forces. Around 100 fixed-wing aircraft and 40
helicopters are allocated to them. Tornado F3,
Harrier and Jaguar aircraft, and Rapier
surface-to-air missiles, form part of the
Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s
Immediate Reaction Force, while Harrier,
Jaguar and Tornado GR1/4 aircraft provide
offensive support and tactical reconnaissance
for the Rapid Reaction Force. Chinook and
Puma helicopters provide troop airlift facilities
for the ARRC or other deployed land forces.
Modified aircraft provide anti-submarine
capabilities for NATO’s multinational
Maritime Reaction Forces.
Modified Tornado GR1/4 aircraft,
equipped with the Sea Eagle missile, have the
task of maritime attack. The RAF will
99
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
continue to provide Nimrod maritime patrol
aircraft and search and rescue helicopters.
Four Tornado GR1/4 squadrons and two
Harrier offensive support squadrons are
stationed in Germany at RAF Bruggen and
RAF Laarbruch respectively. RAF Laarbruch
will close in 1999, with RAF Bruggen closing
in 2002; the aircraft squadrons currently based
there will be withdrawn to the UK.
Other Forces
The UK contributes special forces to support
reaction and main defence force deployments.
In addition, the amphibious force, together
with its Dutch counterpart, is assigned to the
Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic for the
reinforcement of Norway and can be deployed
by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe,
for example, with the ARRC. RAF combat,
maritime patrol and transport aircraft are
available for WEU operations as well.
Wider Security Interests
Military tasks to promote the UK’s wider
security interests may be undertaken
unilaterally or multilaterally under UN,
NATO or OSCE auspices. The UK remains
committed to UN operations. Contingents are
deployed in Cyprus, where Britain is the
largest UN contributor; Georgia; Sierra
Leone; Bosnia and Croatia (see p. 85); and on
the Iraq/Kuwait border. Over Iraq/Kuwait,
Tornado GRl/4s, supported by VC10 tanker
aircraft, are policing the no-fly zones. Other
British forces, including an aircraft carrier and
further RAF aircraft, have been deployed to the
Gulf since November 1997 to ensure that Iraq
complies fully with UN resolutions (see p. 82).
Royal Navy ships of the Armilla Patrol seek
to provide reassurance and assistance to entitled
merchant shipping in the Gulf area and
regularly participate in maritime exercises with
navies of Gulf states and Gulf war coalition
allies. The Patrol also conducts interception
and boarding operations to ensure that ships do
not breach UN sanctions against Iraq.
The number of operations against trafficking
in illicit drugs has increased in recent years, for
example in the Caribbean, where the West
Indies Guardship and other Royal Navy ships
work closely with the authorities of the United
States, the Overseas Territories and the
Regional Security System to combat drug
trafficking. Although primary responsibility for
this work rests with the local law enforcement
agencies or other government departments, the
armed forces assist where they can do so
without detriment to the performance of their
other military tasks.
British troops remain ready to participate
in operations or potential operations
throughout the world. In the past three years
in Africa alone, British troops have taken part
in UN and multinational forces in evacuation
operations in Rwanda, Somalia, Angola,
Liberia, the former Zaire and Sierra Leone.
Military Assistance
During 1997-98, over 100 countries received
UK military assistance through the
deployment of about 400 service personnel on
loan and 300 in short-term training teams; and
through attendance by some 4,000 overseas
students at training courses in the UK.
NUCLEAR FORCES
Although the Government promised to retain
the Trident submarine force as the ultimate
guarantee of national security, the UK and
other members of NATO have radically
reduced their reliance on nuclear weapons in
recent years. However, nuclear deterrence still
has an important contribution to make in
insuring against the re-emergence of major
strategic military threats, in preventing
nuclear coercion, and in preserving peace and
stability in Europe.
The UK is committed to pressing for
progress in the negotiations towards mutual,
balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear
weapons (see p. 86). When satisfied that verified
progress has been made towards the goal of
global elimination of nuclear weapons, the
Government will ensure that the British nuclear
weapons are included in the negotiations.
Against this background, the Government
has undertaken a fundamental re-examination
of all aspects of Britain’s nuclear posture, and
has concluded that fewer than 200
operationally available nuclear warheads are
100
DEFENCE
needed—a reduction of one third. Trident
submarines will carry only 48 warheads
compared with the previous ceiling of 96. In
addition, there will be only one submarine on
patrol at a time; its missiles will not be
targeted and it will normally be at several
days’ ‘notice to fire’.
NEW FORCE STRUCTURES AND
CAPABILITIES
To achieve its policy objectives, the UK
requires forces with a high degree of mobility
and effectiveness, at sufficient readiness and
with a clear sense of purpose, for combat
operations, conflict prevention, crisis
management and humanitarian activities.
These forces must therefore be flexible and able
to undertake the full spectrum of military tasks.
The Strategic Defence Review outlined a
range of measures to increase a joint-service
approach to defence. These include, among
other things, the creation of:
• Joint Rapid Reaction Forces bringing
together all readily available forces from
all three Services, with enhanced
transport and supporting capabilities, to
form a pool from which the right forces
can be drawn to mount a range of short-
notice operations;
• Joint Force 2000, a joint command of
Royal Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft
able to operate from aircraft carriers or
land bases;
• a helicopter command, bringing together
all 400 battlefield helicopters—Navy
commando helicopters, Army attack and
light utility helicopters and RAF support
helicopters;
• a joint Army/RAF ground-based air
defence organisation;
• a joint Army/RAF unit for defence
against nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons; and
• a joint Defence Centre for the
development of defence doctrine, and a
new post of Chief of Defence Logistics
covering all three Services.
Enhanced capabilities and equipment, as well
as reductions in areas of declining importance,
are also planned, to provide highly flexible,
well-equipped forces able to project power
rapidly to potential troublespots and crises.
Royal Navy
The focus for the Navy will continue to move
from large-scale open-ocean warfare to force
projection and offshore operations in
conjunction with the other Services:
• two large aircraft carriers, capable of
operating up to 50 aircraft and
helicopters, will replace the existing three
aircraft carriers;
• the acquisition of four roll on roll off
container ships will strengthen the
amphibious force;
• there will be small reductions in the
number of attack submarines (12 to 10),
destroyers and frigates (35 to 32) and
mine-countermeasure ships (25 to 22);
• all remaining attack-class submarines will
became capable of firing Tomahawk
land-attack missiles.
Army
Among measures aimed at improving
mobility, firepower and the projection of
forces are:
• an increase in the number of the
armoured mechanised brigades from five
to six through the conversion of the
airborne brigade to a mechanised brigade;
• the creation of a new, powerful air
manoeuvre brigade (combining two
battalions of the Parachute Regiment),
with the new attack helicopter when it
enters into service;
• the creation of an additional armoured
reconnaissance regiment from an existing
armoured regiment, which will be
brought back from Germany;
• converting the tank regiments from eight
to six larger units with significantly more
personnel and tanks each; and
• increasing the utility of the Territorial
Army (TA) for operations (see p. 103).
101
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
RAF
The emphasis of the new plans is on the
ability to deploy appropriate types of aircraft
rapidly to crises. Measures include:
• the procurement of new air-to-air, anti¬
armour and air-to-surface missiles for
Tornado and Eurofighter aircraft;
• developing a new collusion warning
system for the Tornado GR4;
• improving the Nimrod reconnaissance
aircraft’s capability for peacemaking and
warfighting operations;
• modernising the air transport fleet, in the
short term by the acquisition of four C-
17 large aircraft or their equivalent; and
• reducing front-line aircraft by 36 and
disbanding two squadrons.
DEFENCE EQUIPMENT
Modern equipment is essential if one of the key
aims of Britain’s force restructuring programme
is to be achieved, namely that of increasing the
flexibility and mobility of the armed forces.
Improvements for the Royal Navy
equipment programme include:
• the introduction of the fourth Trident
submarine and the building of the
Astute-class attack submarines;
• a modernised destroyer and frigate fleet,
including a new air defence frigate
developed with France and Italy;
• the new helicopter carrier, the
purchasing of additional roll on roll off
container ships and the building of two
amphibious ships to strengthen the
amphibious force; and
• the Merlin anti-submarine helicopter.
The Army front line is being enhanced by:
• the introduction of the Challenger 2
battle tank;
• Westland Apache attack helicopters
equipped with new anti-tank missiles;
• improved Rapier and new Starstreak
missiles to improve air defence;
• new bridging equipment to increase
mobility and flexibility; and
• a range of advanced surveillance, target
acquisition and reconnaissance equipment.
Improvements for the RAF include:
• the Eurofighter from the beginning of the
next century, to replace Tornado F3 and
Jaguar aircraft;
• the upgrading of the Jaguar and Tornado
aircraft;
• new Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft;
• orders for new air-launched anti-armour
and stand-off missiles; and
• orders for further EH101 and Chinook
support helicopters and the introduction
of Hercules C130J aircraft.
Defence Procurement
Nearly 45% of the defence budget is spent on
military equipment, including the procurement
of spares and associated costs. When assessing
options, particular consideration is given not
just to the initial costs of a project, but also to
those necessary to support it throughout its
service life. Competition for contracts takes
place wherever possible. Measures to improve
the procuring of defence equipment, identified
by the Strategic Defence Review’s ‘smart
procurement’ initiative, include fuller early
planning, an improved through-life approach
and joint arrangements with industry.
International Procurement Collaboration
International collaboration offers military,
economic and industrial benefits at a time of
rising production costs and reduced defence
budgets. The UK plays an active role in
NATO’s Conference of National Armaments
Directors, which promotes equipment
collaboration between NATO nations, and in
the WEU’s Western European Armaments
Group, which is the main European forum for
the discussion of armaments matters. The UK
is also a founder member of‘OCCAR’, an
armaments co-operation organisation formed
with France, Germany and Italy for managing
collaborative procurement activities. Current
collaborative programmes in which the UK
participates include:
102
DEFENCE
• development of the Eurofighter (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
• anti-tank guided weapons (Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands);
• air defence frigate (France and Italy);
• a battlefield radar system (France and
Germany);
• the EH 101 helicopter (Italy);
• a multi-role armoured vehicle (France
and Germany); and
• a request for proposals for a Future
Large Aircraft (with Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey).

Commissioned Ranks
Commissions in the armed services, either by
promotion from the ranks or by direct entry
based on educational and other qualifications,
are granted for short, medium and long terms.
All three Services have schemes for school,
university and college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, which may include degree courses at
service establishments or universities.
Courses of higher training for officers,
designed to emphasise the joint approach to
the tactical and operational levels of conflict,
are provided at a new Joint Services
Command and Staff College, established in
1997. From 2000 the college will be based at
Watchfield.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks
vary widely in length and terms of service.
Subject to a minimum period, entrants may
leave at any time, giving 18 months’ notice (12
months for certain engagements). Discharge
may also be granted on compassionate or
medical grounds.
In addition to their basic training, non¬
commissioned personnel receive
supplementary specialist training throughout
their careers. Study for educational
qualifications is encouraged and service trade
and technical training lead to nationally
recognised qualifications. New vocational
training and educational initiatives to improve
recruitment and retention were announced in
the Strategic Defence Review.
The Army Foundation College, which
opened in September 1998, offers a 42-week
course combining military training and the
opportunity to acquire national qualifications.
The course is intended to attract high-quality
recruits who will go on to fill senior posts in
front-line roles.
Reserve Forces
The Reserve Forces serve alongside the
regular forces and are integral to the ability to
expand the Services in times of crises. In
particular, reserves can provide skills and
units not available or required in peacetime.
The reserves include former members of the
regular armed forces liable for service in an
emergency (regular reserve) and part-time
volunteer reserves, recruited directly from the
civilian community—the Royal Naval
Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve, the TA
and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.
The Government has concluded that in the
future the main contribution of reserves—
both individuals and formed units—should be
to support regular forces in clearly identifiable
and worthwhile roles. This requires their full
integration into regular formations and ready
103

availability for service, where necessary
through selective compulsory call-out in
situations short of a direct threat to the UK.
Reserves should also be able to serve in peace
support operations. Royal Naval and RAF
volunteer reserve numbers will increase, but
the changed strategic environment will lead to
a reduction in the TA from 56,000 to 40,000.
Equal Opportunities
The Ministry of Defence has introduced
measures to stamp out discrimination on race,
sex or religious grounds. Some 73% of posts
in the Royal Navy and 96% of posts in the
RAF are open to women. Since April 1998,
the number of posts open to women in the
Army has increased from 47% to 70%. The
Services are also aiming to increase the intake
of recruits from the ethnic minorities from 1%
to 5% by the end of 2001-02.
ADMINISTRATION
The defence budget for 1998-99 is £22,240
million. However, by 2001—02 defence
spending will fall from 2.7% to 2.4% of gross
domestic product. The current average for
NATO countries is 2.3%.
Defence Management
The Ministry of Defence is both a
Department of State and the highest level
military headquarters. The Secretary of State
for Defence is responsible for the formulation
and conduct of defence policy and for the
means with which it is carried out. Three
junior Ministers for each Service and two key
officials—the Chief of the Defence Staff
(CDS) and the Permanent Under Secretary
(PUS) of State—directly support the
Secretary of State in this task.
The CDS is the professional head of the
armed forces, to whom the three single
Service Chiefs of Staff report and are
responsible for the fighting effectiveness,
efficiency and morale of their own Services.
The PUS has primary responsibility for
policy, finance and administration of the
department. Both are members of the Defence
Council, the highest departmental committee.
A mixed civilian-military central staff
support much of the work of Defence Council
members, which includes formulating defence
policy, resource allocation, defining future
equipment requirements and providing the
strategic direction for military operations.
Day-to-day activities and management of
the armed forces are administered through
operational, personnel and logistics
commands. The development and acquisition
of defence equipment is handled by the
Procurement Executive, headed by the Chief
of Defence Procurement (who is also a
member of the Defence Council). It is planned
that the Procurement Executive, like many
other functions of the Ministry of Defence,
will assume executive agency status from 1999
(see p. 58). As such, a Chief Executive will be
appointed to be accountable for agency
performance against objectives and targets
agreed by Ministers.

Language 111 Economic and Social Changes 114
The UK has a growing number of elderly people, reflecting improved standards
of healthcare and falling death rates. Other long-term social changes include a
decline in the number of marriages, many more people living on their own, and
much greater participation by women in the workforce. Higher living standards
are reflected in the spread of ownership of many consumer durables, such as
home computers, video recorders and freezers.
POPULATION
The UK’s population in mid-1997 was
estimated at 59 million, the 19th largest in the
world and the third biggest in Europe (after
Russia and Germany). On mid-1996-based
projections, it is forecast to rise to 60.3
million in 2006, 61.6 million in 2016 and 62.2
million in 2021. Projections over the longer
term indicate that the population will peak
around 2031, at about 62.8 million, and then
start to fall, owing to fewer births and the
gradual rise in the average age of the
population.
The population density is about 241
inhabitants per sq km, which is well above the
European Union (EU) average of some 117
per sq km. Of the four lands, England is by
far the most densely populated, with 376
people per sq km in 1996. Scotland is the least
densely populated, with 66 people per sq km.
Wales and Northern Ireland have 140 and 122
people per sq km respectively. Since the 19th
century there has been a trend for people to
move away from congested urban centres into
the suburbs.
Birth Rates
In 1997 there were 725,800 live births in the
UK, representing 12.3 live births per 1,000
population. This relatively low birth rate
reflects a preference for smaller families than
in the past. Many women are postponing
having children, and there has been an
increase in the average age of women giving
birth, from 26.8 years in England and Wales in
1981 to 28.8 years in 1997. The total period
fertility rate (an indication of average family
size) remains below 2.1, the level leading to
the long-term replacement of the population.
Births outside marriage accounted for
almost 37% of all births in the UK in 1997,
around five times the level in 1966. However,
some four-fifths of births outside marriage in
England and Wales in 1997 were jointly
registered by both parents, and in the majority
of these cases the parents shared an address.
Mortality
Life expectancy in the UK is increasing by
around two years every decade. At birth the

expectation of life for a man is now over 74
years and for a woman over 79 years.
There were 629,700 deaths in 1997, a death
rate of just under 11 per 1,000 population.
There has been a decline in mortality at most
ages, particularly among children. The infant
mortality rate (deaths of infants under one
year old per 1,000 live births) was 5.9 in 1997.
Better nutrition, rising standards of living and
advances in medical science are among the
factors contributing to the improved rate.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases
(mainly heart attacks and strokes) account for
over two-fifths of all deaths. Cancer causes
around a quarter of deaths, and respiratory
diseases 16%. The pattern of deaths from
cancer differs markedly between men and
women, with the highest incidence rates being
of lung cancer in men and breast cancer in
women. Deaths among men aged under 65
from the most common causes—heart disease,
lung cancer and strokes—have fallen to less
than half the level of 1972.
Although cigarette smoking has been
declining, it remains the greatest single cause
of preventable illness and loss of life in the
UK, and is associated with around 120,000
deaths each year. Traditionally many more
men than women have smoked, but now the
proportion is virtually the same. In 1996—97,
29% of men and 28% of women in Great
Britain aged 16 and over smoked cigarettes,
compared with 52% and 41% for men and
women aged 15 and over in 1972.
Households and Families
Average household size in Great Britain has
nearly halved during the 20th century;
between 1961 and 1996—97 it fell from 3.1 to
2.4 (see Table 9.2). Many more people are
living on their own, and one-person
households account for 27% of all households,
with around 11% of adults in private
households living on their own. There have
also been significant declines in the proportion
of households consisting of three or more
people and in the proportion of traditional
families consisting of a couple with dependent
children. The number of households in Great
Britain has continued to rise, from 16.3
million in 1961 to 23.5 million in 1996-97.
Marriage, Divorce and Cohabitation
In 1996 there were 317,500 marriages in the
UK, the lowest number since 1917. First
marriages for both partners, of which there
were 192,100 in 1995, have declined by half
compared with the peak reached in 1970. A
significant proportion of marriages—nearly

two-fifths—represent remarriages for one or
both partners. Fewer people are marrying in
church, and religious ceremonies account for
just over two-fifths of marriage ceremonies,
compared with nearly three-fifths in 1971.
There has been a long-term rise in the
number of divorces in the UK, although in
recent years the increase appears to have
levelled off, with the number granted in
1996—171,700—being below the peak of
1993. When equivalent data is available for all
EU countries, the 1996 UK rate is likely to
represent the highest divorce rate in the EU.
There were 13.8 divorces for every 1,000
married couples in England and Wales in
1996; divorce rates for Scotland and Northern
Ireland were lower. Nearly three-quarters of
divorces were granted to wives. The most
common basis for wives being granted a
divorce was the unreasonable behaviour of
their husbands, while for men the most
common reason was the adultery of their
wives.
Cohabitation has become much more
widespread, with those in their late 20s and
30s the most likely to cohabit, while people are
living together outside marriage for longer
periods. Between 1981 and 1996-97 the
proportion of non-married women in Great
Britain aged 18—49 who were cohabiting
doubled, to 25%.
Age and Sex Structure
There has been a long-term increase in the
numbers of elderly people in the UK (see
chart), and projections indicate that this will
continue, with the number over retirement age
(65 for men and 60 for women) exceeding
those under 16 for the first time in 2008.
Between 1971 and 1996 the proportion of
those aged 65 and over rose from 14% to
16%, while the proportion of young people
aged under 16 fell from 25% of the population
to 21%. The number aged over 85 has more
than doubled since 1971, to around 1.1
million.
There are about 4% more females than
males in the population as a whole, even
though about 3% more male than female
births occur each year. Men outnumber
women in the younger age groups, but this
gap closes over subsequent years, because of
the higher mortality among men at all ages, so
that the number of women and men in their
mid-40s is approximately equal. Above this
age women outnumber men and the gap
widens, particularly from around 60, so that
by the age of 89 there are about three times as
many women as men.
International Migration
In 1996 the total inflow of people intending to
stay in the UK for one year or more was
272,000, while the outflow of people leaving to
live abroad was 216,000 (see Table 9.3). These
figures exclude migration to and from the
Irish Republic, and are also likely to exclude
people admitted as visitors who were
subsequently granted an extension of stay for a
year or more. Between 1994 and 1996 net
immigration increased the population by
172,000.

Nationality
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with the UK;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (also known as ‘Overseas
Territories’—see p. 74); and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who did not acquire either of
the other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired automatically
at birth by a child born in the UK if his or her
mother or, if born legitimate, father is a
British citizen or is settled in the UK. A child
adopted in the UK by a British citizen is also a
108
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in the UK is generally a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the
citizenship of a child born abroad to a British
citizen in Crown service, certain related
services, or in service under an EU institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration for certain children,
including those born in the UK who do
not automatically acquire such
citizenship at birth, or who have been
born abroad to a parent who is a citizen
by descent;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in the UK, except for people
from Gibraltar, who may be registered
without residence;
• by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality; and
• by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. Requirements include five years’
residence, or three years’ if the applicant’s
spouse is a British citizen. Those who are not
married to a British citizen are also required to
have a sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh
or Scottish Gaelic; they must also intend to
have their main home in the UK or be
employed by the Crown, or by an
international organisation of which the UK is
a member, or by a company or association
established in the UK.
Special arrangements covering certain
Hong Kong residents have been made:
• the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act
1990 made provision for the registration
as British citizens before 30 June 1997
(when the territory returned to the
People’s Republic of China) of up to
50,000 people who were able to meet
certain criteria, together with their
spouses and any children who were still
minors; and
• the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act
1997 provided for the registration of
solely British nationals after 1 July 1997.
In 1997, 40,000 people, including those in
Hong Kong, were granted British citizenship.
Immigration
Immigration into the UK is largely governed
by the Immigration Act 1971 and the
Immigration Rules made under it. The Rules
set out the requirements to be met by those
who are subject to immigration control and
seek entry to, or leave to remain in, the UK.
New Immigration Rules came into effect
in 1994. British citizens and those
Commonwealth citizens who had the right of
abode before January 1983 maintain the right
of abode and are not subject to immigration
control.
In 1997, 10.9 million foreign and
Commonwealth nationals (excluding nationals
of the European Economic Area—see below)
were admitted to the UK. Some 59,000 people
were accepted for settlement.
Under the Immigration Rules nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial
entities must obtain a visa before they can
enter the UK. Other nationals subject to
immigration control require entry clearance
when coming to work or settle in the UK.
Visas and other entry clearances are normally
obtained from the nearest or other specified
British diplomatic post in a person’s home
country.
Nationals of the European Economic Area
(EEA)—EU member states plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein—are not subject to
substantive immigration control. They may
work in the UK without restriction. Provided
they are working or able to support themselves
financially, EEA nationals have a right to
reside in the UK.
Recent Changes
With the intention of making the immigration
system fairer for marriage partners of British
citizens or people settled in the UK, the
Government has abolished the ‘primary
purpose’ immigration rule introduced in 1980.

Under this, an overseas national wishing to
settle in the UK with a British citizen or
settled spouse could be refused leave to enter
or remain in the UK if it was considered that
the primary purpose of the marriage was to
settle in the UK. The rule was abolished in
1997.
In 1997 the Government also introduced a
concession to help couples who are by law
prohibited from marrying, either because one
of the partners cannot remarry or because they
are of the same sex. Under the new
concession, an applicant may qualify for leave
to enter or remain in the UK provided certain
criteria are met.
Asylum
The UK has traditionally granted asylum to
those fleeing persecution and respects its
obligations under the United Nations
Convention and Protocol relating to the Status
of Refugees. These provide that refugees
lawfully resident should enjoy treatment at
least as favourable as that accorded to the
indigenous population. In recent years there
has been a significant change in both the
numbers and the motivation of those seeking
asylum in the UK, with many asylum seekers
apparently motivated by economic rather than
political factors. In the late 1980s the total
started to rise dramatically from around 4,000
a year during 1985-88 to 44,800 in 1991.
Following the introduction of measures in
1991 to deter multiple and other fraudulent
applications, numbers fell back in 1992 and
1993. However, applications increased
substantially between 1994 and 1995. They
fell back again in 1996, following the reduction
in benefit entitlement for asylum seekers, but
have continued rising since 1997. Many other
Western countries have seen significant
increases in the number of asylum seekers.
Germany received by far the most in 1997
(136,000), followed by the UK (41,500), the
Netherlands (34,000), Switzerland (24,000)
and France (24,000)—figures include
dependants. In common with other Western
countries, the UK has reviewed its
procedures. The Asylum and Immigration Act
1996, introduced under the previous
Government, created the power to designate
countries of destination as not generally giving
rise to a serious risk of persecution. It made
appeals against return to EU, and certain
other, safe third countries exercisable only
after removal from the UK; and made it a
criminal offence for an employer to employ
someone who does not have permission to
reside or work in the UK.
In 1997, an estimated 36,000 asylum
decisions were made, of which around 10%
were grants of asylum. The main nationalities
applying for asylum were people from Somalia
(8%), the former Yugoslavia (7%), Nigeria
(7%), countries formerly part of the Soviet
Union (6%), China (6%), Sri Lanka (6%),
Pakistan (5%), and Turkey (4%). Most failed
asylum seekers continued to appeal against
their removal from the UK, and 20,950 new
appeals were lodged. Of the 21,090 who had
their asylum appeals heard before special
adjudicators in 1997, only 1,180 (just over
5%) were successful. The current trend for
110
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
asylum applications (excluding dependants) in
the UK suggests further increases to nearly
38,000 in 1998-99 and to 44,000 in
1999-2000.
The number of applications for British
citizenship continues to rise. An estimated
62,200 applications were received in 1997-98
compared with some 40,000 in 1992-93. The
upward trend is expected to continue in
1998-99.
The Special Immigration Appeals
Commission began work in August 1998. The
Commission, which deals with appeals in cases
where individuals are liable for deportation on
grounds of national security, was set up in
response to criticism by the European Court
of Human Rights that such decisions were not
subject to judicial supervision.
Immigration and Asylum White Paper
Plans to speed up and simplify the
immigration and asylum system were
published in the White Paper Fairer, Faster
and Firmer in July 1998. Proposals include:
• setting up a new national body to plan
and co-ordinate immigration control;
• replacing the existing two-tier appeals
system with a single right of appeal,
considering the case as a whole, including
removal arrangements;
• introducing a statutory scheme to
regulate unscrupulous immigration
advisers;
• helping to speed up processing asylum
applications by reducing the period
allowed for submission of further
representation after interview from 28
days to five;
• creating new support arrangements for
destitute asylum seekers, which minimise
incentives to economic migration by
separating support for asylum seekers
from the main social security benefits
system and providing accommodation
with no choice about its location;
• taking a tougher approach to deterring
and preventing the arrival of
inadequately documented passengers;
and
• modernising the framework of
immigration law to enable control to be
exercised more flexibly.
LANGUAGE
English is the main language spoken in the
UK, and is also one of the most widely used in
the world.1 Recent estimates suggest that 310
million people speak it as their first language,
with a similar number speaking it as a second
language. It is an official language in a large
number of overseas countries, and is widely
used internationally as the main language for
purposes such as air traffic control,
international maritime communications and
academic gatherings.
Modern English derives primarily from one
of the dialects of Old English (or Anglo-
Saxon), itself made up of several Western
Germanic dialects taken to Britain in the early
5th century. However, it has been very greatly
influenced by other languages, particularly
Latin—the language of learning and religion
from the time of Old English—and, following
the Norman conquest, by French—the
language of court, government and the
nobility for many years after 1066. The re-
emergence of English as the standard language
of England was marked by events such as the
Statute of Pleading in 1362, which laid down
that English was to replace French as the
language of law. The 14th century saw the
first major English literature since Anglo-
Saxon days, with works such as Piers Plowman
by William Langland and the Canterbury Tales
by Geoffrey Chaucer. However, there
remained great regional variations in the
language, and spellings were not always
standardised.
Following the introduction of the printing
press to England by William Caxton in the late
15th century, there was a considerable
flowering of English literature in the 16th and
early 17th centuries. William Shakespeare,
Edmund Spenser and Christopher Marlowe
produced work that is still famous today.
Cranmer’s prayerbook and the Authorised
(’King James’) Version of the Bible, which

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
have had a profound effect on literature down
to modern times, also date from this period.
About this time, too, translations of Latin,
Italian and other European works into English
vastly expanded the English language. The
work of early lexicographers, of whom the
most famous was Samuel Johnson (1709-84),
led to greater standardisation in matters such
as spelling.
ETHNIC AND NATIONAL
MINORITIES
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in the UK, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities.
The Irish have long formed a large section
of the population. Jewish refugees who came
to the UK towards the end of the 19th century
and in the 1930s were followed by other
European refugees after 1945. Substantial
immigration from the Caribbean and the
South Asian subcontinent dates principally
from the 1950s and 1960s, while many people
of Asian descent moved to this country from
eastern Africa. In recent years, the number of
people coming from the South Asian
subcontinent has remained roughly stable, but
there has been a rise in immigration from

some African countries, such as Ghana,
Nigeria, Somalia and Uganda (see Table 9.4).
The 1991 census included for the first time
a question on ethnic grouping. This found
that 94.5% of the population belonged to the
‘White’ group, while just over 3 million people
(5.5%) described themselves as belonging to
another ethnic group (see Table 9.5).
Overall, just under half of the ethnic
minority population was born in the UK. A
higher proportion was under 16 than for the
White group (respectively 33% and 19%), but
a much lower proportion was over pensionable
age (respectively 3% and about 17%).
Members of ethnic minority groups were
heavily concentrated in industrial and urban
areas, and over half lived in the South East,
especially in London. The highest proportion
was in the London borough of Brent: nearly
45% of the local population. Ethnic minority
groups also accounted for over a third of the
population in the London boroughs of
Newham, Tower Hamlets and Hackney.
Outside London the main concentrations were
in Leicester, Slough, Luton, Bradford, the
West Midlands and the Pennine conurbations.
Regional concentrations varied among the
ethnic groups. About three-fifths of people
from black ethnic groups lived in London,
compared with about two-fifths of Indians and
just under one-fifth of Pakistanis, who were
concentrated in other metropolitan areas such
as the West Midlands and West Yorkshire.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the Black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made over the last 20 years in tackling
racial disadvantage in the UK.
Many individuals have achieved distinction
in their careers and in public life, and the
proportion of ethnic minority members
occupying professional and managerial
positions is increasing. There are at present
nine Black and Asian Members of Parliament,
and the number of ethnic minority councillors
in local government is growing. There has also
been an expansion of commercial enterprise,
and there are numerous self-help projects in

ethnic minority communities. Black
competitors have represented the UK in a
range of sports (such as athletics, cricket and
football), and ethnic minority talents in the
arts and in entertainment have increasingly
been recognised.
Economic, environmental, educational and
health programmes of central government and
local authorities exist to combat disadvantage.
There are also special allocations, mainly
through grants from the Home Office and
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions, which channel extra
resources into projects of specific benefit to
ethnic minorities. These include, for example,
the provision of specialist teachers for children
needing English language tuition. Cultural
and recreational schemes and the health and
personal social services also take account of the
particular needs of ethnic minorities. The
Government is promoting equal opportunities
for ethnic minorities through training
programmes, including greater provision for
unemployed people who need training in
English as a second language.
A Race Relations Forum was set up in June
1998 to provide ethnic minority communities
with a new channel of communication to
government.
The Commission on the Future of Multi-
Ethnic Britain was set up by the
Runnymede Trust in January 1998. The
Commission, which has been welcomed
by the Government, will publish
recommendations on how the UK’s social
and political institutions need to adapt to
the changing nature of the population.
Members of the Commission are drawn
from employment, law, policing, health,
local government, education and the
media. They will seek both oral and
written evidence from a wide range of
sources including interested pressure
groups and individuals.
Race Relations Legislation
The Race Relations Act 1976, which applies to
England, Scotland and Wales, and parallel
legislation for Northern Ireland introduced in
1997, make discrimination unlawful on
grounds of colour, race, nationality or ethnic
or national origin in the provision of goods,
facilities and services, in employment, in
housing, in education and in advertising. The
legislation gives complainants direct access to
civil courts and, for employment complaints,
to industrial tribunals.
It is a criminal offence to incite racial
hatred under the provisions of the Public
Order Act 1986.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (see
p. 216) has created new offences of racially
aggravated harassment and violence and
criminal damage. It has also introduced court
orders which prohibit named individuals from
harassing the community at large, including
racially motivated harassment.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality was
established by the 1976 Act. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important educational role and has issued
codes of practice in employment, education,
healthcare, maternity services and housing. It
also provides advice to the general public
about the Race Relations Act and may help
individuals with their complaints about racial
discrimination. In 1997 over 10,000 people
contacted the Commission for advice about
racial discrimination, and 1,661 formally
applied for legal assistance with their case.
The Commission can also undertake or fund
research.
The Commission supports the work of 91
racial equality councils. These are autonomous
voluntary bodies set up in most areas with a
significant ethnic minority population to
promote equality of opportunity and good
relations at the local level. The Commission
helps pay the salaries of officers employed by
the racial equality councils, most of which also
receive funds from their local authorities. It
also gives grants to ethnic minority self-help
groups and to other projects run by or for the
benefit of the ethnic minority communities.
A Commission for Racial Equality for
Northern Ireland was established in 1997,

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
with powers similar to those for England,
Wales and Scotland.
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES
Marked improvements in the UK’s standard
of living have taken place during the 20th
century—between 1971 and 1997 real
household disposable income per head more
than doubled. Gross domestic product (GDP)
per head in 1997 was around the average for
the 15 EU countries.
Income and Wealth
Wages and salaries before tax remain the main
source of household income for most people,
although the proportion they contribute has
declined, from 61% in 1987 to 56% in 1997.
In 1997 other main sources of household
income included net property income (10%)
and pensions and other social benefits (21%).
There are over 18 million working-age
households (with at least one person of
working age) in the UK. In autumn 1997
about 9.7 million (53%) were ‘work-rich’
households, where all adults in the
household were in work, but 17% had no
one in employment. Couples with children
have a low level of worklessness (about 6%
in autumn 1997) and lone parents a very
high level (49%).
The value of wealth held by the household
sector in the UK was £3,582,000 million in
1997. Investment in life assurance and pension
funds accounted for 36%, compared with
24% in 1987 (see Table 9.6), while the
proportion in stocks, shares and other
securities also rose considerably between 1987
and 1997. These changes reflect the long-term
rise in the UK stock market and in the price of
company equities. Many more people became
shareholders in 1997, mainly as a result of the
conversion of five large building societies to
banks (see chapter 30). On the other hand, the
general fall in house prices during the early
1990s is reflected in the decline in the
proportion of wealth accounted for by
dwellings. Nevertheless, a large proportion of
households—67%—own their own homes.
About two-fifths of these households own
their property outright, while the remainder
have a mortgage.
Distribution
Government taxes and benefits help to
redistribute income. For example, in 1996-97
the bottom 20% of households accounted for
just 2% of income earned, but, after taking
account of taxes and benefits, their share rose
to 7% of post-tax income. The gap between
those with high and low incomes widened
rapidly during the 1980s. Although it then
narrowed in the first half of the 1990s, this
trend may not be continuing.
Wealth is less evenly distributed than
income, with the richest 10% of the

THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
population having 50% of marketable wealth
in 1995—64% when the value of dwellings is
excluded. However, the less affluent half of
the population owned 8% of marketable
wealth in 1995—7% excluding the value of
dwellings.
Social Exclusion
Some people have been excluded from the
benefits of rising real incomes and wealth in the
UK, through disadvantages such as
unemployment, poor housing, and splitting up
of families. Tackling the problems arising from
social exclusion is one of the Government’s key
tasks. It intends to produce an annual report on
poverty in the UK, and key indicators of social
exclusion are being drawn up. A Social
Exclusion Unit has been set up in the Cabinet
Office to examine some of the major problems.
The Unit has produced reports on truancy,
rough sleeping, and the most rundown housing
estates (see p. 354).
Eating and Drinking Habits
There has been a significant shift in eating
patterns over the last decade (see chart on
p. 116), reflecting greater emphasis on health,
frozen and convenience foods. One feature is the
differing trends in the pattern of consumption of
fresh fruit and vegetables. Fresh fruit is
increasingly popular as are ‘non-green’
vegetables, such as mushrooms, courgettes and
peppers. However, consumption of fresh green
vegetables, including cabbages, peas and beans,
was lower in 1997 than ten years earlier, despite
an increase in 1997.
Other features of the pattern of
consumption in 1997 compared with 1996
included:
• a recovery in home consumption of
carcase beef, which rose by 9% following
a fall of 17% in 1996 when consumption
was affected by concern over eating beef
(see chapter 27);
• a continuation of the relatively high level
of demand for poultry, which accounted
for 44% of the primary meat market in
1997, compared with 38% in 1995;
• a fall in consumption of tea, coffee and
other beverages, after several years of
relative stability, while household
consumption of alcoholic drinks rose by
1.3% and of soft drinks by 0.8%; and
• a further fall in margarine consumption,
so that for the first time since 1980 more
butter than margarine is being eaten in
the home—although reduced fat and low
fat spreads remain predominant.
Average mineral and nutrient intakes are
generally above the daily amounts
recommended by the Department of Health.
Health considerations appear to be influencing
diet, for example, in the fall in red meat sales,
the move away from whole milk to skimmed
and semi-skimmed milk, and the growth in low
fat spread consumption.
Pubs retain their popularity, with 80% of ale
and stout being drunk in pubs and clubs, and
many have become popular venues for eating
out. Lager is now estimated to account for nearly
60% of all beer sales. Nowadays ‘fast food’
oudets—selling, for example, hamburgers,
pizza, chicken and the traditional fish and
chips—are widespread in the UK’s high streets.
In restaurants one can eat food from many other
countries—Chinese, Indian, Italian and French
are among the most widely available cuisines.
Sandwich bars and coffee shops are common,
especially in towns and cities.
Women
The economic and domestic lives of women
have been transformed in the 20th century.
They now make up nearly 45% of the
workforce in employment. In 1997-98 married
women in work formed 29% of the workforce,
compared with 12% in 1951. However, women
are still under-represented in some
occupations and at senior levels. For example,
women account for fewer than 5% of company
directors, about 7% of full-time university
professors, 10% of judges and 15% of senior
civil servants.
Government and Administration
There are a record 121 women MPs in
Parliament. Five women sit in the Cabinet,

including the Leader of the House of Lords,
who is also the Minister for Women. She
chairs the Cabinet Sub-committee on
Women’s Issues. Support is provided by the
Women’s Unit in the Cabinet Office.
The Government is seeking to improve
communications with women’s organisations.
Following a review in 1998, action is being
taken to make the advisory Women’s National
Commission more responsive and influential,
and better able to represent the views of
women’s organisations. Its membership is to be
increased by 50% to 75 women’s organisations
with a view to reaching the smaller groups
representing women. At present the
Commission covers 50 of the national women’s
organisations which between them represent
around 8 million women.
Employment and Social Security
The Government is encouraging the
development of ‘family-friendly’ employment
policies and practices. It supports
‘Opportunity 2000’, an employer-led initiative
(with around 325 members) to increase the
participation of women in the workforce.
Action is being taken to enable more women
to join or re-enter the labour market and to
improve employment rights, including:
116
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
In June 1998 the Government launched an
initiative to encourage the greater
participation of under-represented groups
in public life. For the first time, it has been
agreed in principle to aim for a 50:50 ratio
of women to men in new public
appointments. The Government is also
working to ensure that the perspective of
women and of minority groups is
automatically taken into account in the
development of government policies, so
that steps can be taken to remove any
adverse effects where appropriate. This
process has come to be known as
‘mainstreaming’.
• measures to help make work pay, through
the national minimum wage (see p. 157)
and the Working Families Tax Credit
(see p. 180), both of which will come into
force in 1999;
• the New Deal for Lone Parents (see
p. 155), which is intended to help more
lone parents (the vast majority of whom
are women) to return to work;
• new employment rights (see p. 159), such
as the right for women and men to a
minimum of three months’ parental leave
on the birth or adoption of a child, and
the right to leave of absence for family
emergencies; and
• a wide-ranging review of maternity
rights and family-friendly employment
policies.
In May 1998 the Government published a
Green Paper, Meeting the Childcare Challenge.
This included proposals for a National
Childcare Strategy, which aims to secure a
range of affordable and good-quality childcare
for children aged up to 14 in every
neighbourhood. Financial support of £334
million is planned over the next five years,
including £170 million from the New
Opportunities Fund (see p. 120), for out-of¬
school childcare. From October 1999 a new
Childcare Tax Credit, within the Working
Families Tax Credit, will provide help with
childcare costs for parents in work.
Research has found that women are much
less likely than men to have substantial
pension rights on divorce—women may find it
difficult to build up a sufficient pension
entitlement, as a result of career breaks, part-
time working or low pay. A draft Bill on fairer
treatment of pension rights in divorce
settlements was issued for consultation in June
1998. It includes provision for pension¬
sharing, so that, on divorce, the value of the
pension rights of both husband and wife may
be taken into account in calculating the
financial settlement, with the aim of ensuring
a fairer division of all assets.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination between men and women
unlawful, with certain limited exceptions, in
employment, education, training and the
provision of housing, goods, facilities and
services. Discriminatory job recruitment
advertisements are unlawful. Under the Equal
Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984, women in
Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with
men when doing work that is the same or
broadly similar, work which is rated as
equivalent, or work which is of equal value.
Parallel legislation on sex discrimination and
equal pay applies in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC), an independent statutory body, has
the duties of working towards the elimination
of sex discrimination and promoting equality
of opportunity. It can undertake formal
investigations and issue notices requiring
discriminatory practices to stop. The EOC
runs an ‘Equality Exchange’, with around 700
members, which enables employers to
exchange information on good practice.
Safety
In 1995, 43% (an estimated 680,000) of total
violent offences against women were domestic
attacks. The Government is developing a
programme of measures to prevent violence
against women wherever possible, and to
protect women and provide justice for them
when violence does occur. This will cover
117
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
England and Wales. Separate strategies are
being developed for Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
The Voluntary Sector
There is a long tradition in the UK of
voluntary service to the community.
Hundreds of thousands of voluntary
organisations exist, ranging from national
bodies to small local groups. Voluntary
organisations may be staffed by professional
workers, but most rely on the efforts of
volunteers at some level. Almost half of all
adults take part in some form of organised
voluntary work in the course of a year. Many
volunteers are involved in work which
improves the quality of life in their local
communities, or give their time to help
organise events or groups in areas as diverse as
social welfare, education, sport, heritage, the
environment and the arts.
The Government greatly values the
voluntary sector’s contribution to society and,
as a result, is keen to encourage productive
partnerships between the statutory and
voluntary sectors. For example, voluntary
organisations are important providers of
government-supported employment and
training services for unemployed people.
The Voluntary and Community Unit within
the Home Office co-ordinates government
policy towards the voluntary sector
throughout the UK.
The Government aims to develop its
partnership with the voluntary sector even
further through a ‘Compact’, which will
provide the framework for an enhanced
relationship. Compacts are being drawn up in
all four home countries in consultation with
the voluntary sector, taking account of the
distinct traditions of voluntary activity in each
constituent part of the UK. A ministerial
taskforce will oversee their implementation. It
is intended to encourage other public bodies
and local government to adopt or adapt
Compacts for use locally.
Government funding in 1997—98 has
included grants to help existing volunteer
bureaux increase their effectiveness and to
complete a network of local volunteer
development agencies. These agencies provide
a focus for volunteering in localities where
there is at present no volunteer bureau.
Funding
Voluntary organisations receive income from
several sources, including:
• contributions from individuals,
businesses and trusts;
• central and local government grants;
• earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
• fees from central and local government
for those services which are provided on
a contractual basis.
In 1994-95 (the most recent year for which
figures are available) direct grants to voluntary
organisations from government amounted to
£957 million.
Charities currently benefit from tax reliefs
worth £1,800 million a year. Tax changes in
recent budgets have helped the voluntary
sector secure more funds from industry and
individuals. The Gift Aid scheme provides tax
relief on single cash donations of at least £250.
Under the Payroll Giving scheme, employees
can also make tax-free donations to charity
from their earnings.
Charities
The charitable sector is a major part of the
economy. In England and Wales some 187,000
charities are registered with the Charity
Commission, a non-ministerial government
department. Their combined income is around
£18,000 million. Over 70% of those registered
had a recorded income of under £10,000. An
estimated 2.5 million people work—paid, or
unpaid—in charities. The Commission also
gives advice to trustees of charities on their
administration and checks abuse.
A charity is an organisation that has been
established for exclusively charitable purposes,
such as the relief of poverty, the advancement
of education or religion, or the promotion of
other purposes of public benefit. These may
include good community relations, the
prevention of racial discrimination, the
protection of health and the promotion of
118
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
equal opportunity. The Charity Commission
has a statutory responsibility to ensure that
charities make effective use of their resources.
Recent legislation has strengthened the
Commissioners’ powers to investigate and
supervise charities. These include new
measures to protect charities and donors from
bogus fund-raisers and a new framework for
charity accounts and reports.
The introduction of the National Lottery
(see p. 120) has given charities and voluntary
organisations the opportunity to secure
substantial new funding for projects across a
range of activities. By August 1998 the
National Lottery Charities Board, which
distributes the portion of the proceeds of the
National Lottery allocated to charities, had
made over 16,000 grants totalling over £890
million. The Board’s aim is to give grants to
support organisations which help meet the
needs of those in society at greatest
disadvantage, and to improve the quality of
life in the community.
CAP (Charities Aid Foundation) is a
registered charity that works to increase
resources for the voluntary sector in the UK
and overseas. As well as providing services
that are both charitable and financial, CAP
undertakes a comprehensive programme of
research and publishing and is established as a
leading source of information on all aspects of
the sector.
Umbrella Organisations
The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations is one of the main national co¬
ordinating bodies in England, providing close
links between voluntary organisations,
government departments, local authorities, the
European Commission and the private sector;

National Lottery
The National Lottery was launched in 1994
and has become the biggest lottery in the
world. About 75% of households regularly
buy tickets for the on-line draw. Ticket sales
amounted to £5,514 million in 1997-98.
Tickets or scratchcards are available from over
35,000 retail outlets. Camelot Group pic, a
private sector consortium, has the franchise to
run the Lottery until 2001.
Sales for the on-line game increased by
23% in 1997-98 following the introduction of
the mid-week draw in February 1997, which
supplements the weekly draw on Saturdays.
Sales are now some £100 million a week, while
weekly sales of scratchcards are over £13
million. In August 1998 Vernons Lotteries
Ltd introduced an on-line game based on
football; it is expected to raise up to £200
million for good causes by 2001.
Allocation of Proceeds
Good causes receive 28% of the Lottery’s
proceeds, one of the highest proportions of
any national lottery in the world. The rest
goes to prizes (50%), National Lottery duty
(12%), retailers’ commission (5%) and
operating costs and profit (5%).
Some £4,963 million had been raised for
good causes by the end of March 1998. By
2001 this is expected to have reached at least
£10,600 million, around £1,000 million more
than originally forecast. Over 31,000 projects
have received awards since the launch of the
Lottery. Awards were initially distributed in
equal proportion to five good causes—sport,
charities, the arts, heritage and projects to
mark the millennium—but the National
Lottery Act 1998 provides for a sixth good
cause (see below). Over half the awards have
been for less than £50,000.
Millennium Projects
The Millennium Commission is supporting
projects which mark the end of the second
millennium and the start of the third. By July
1998 the Commission had awarded £1,260
million to over 180 capital projects at about
3,000 locations throughout the UK. These
include:
• £46 million for the Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff (see p. 309);
• £43 million for a new national cycle
network (see p. 365);
• £33 million for the University for the
Highlands and Islands; and
• £23 million for the National Space
Centre, in Leicester (see p. 428).
It is also funding a Millennium Awards
scheme, enabling individuals to achieve a
personal goal while bringing benefits to their
communities, and a Millennium Festival. The
centrepiece of the Festival will be the
Millennium Experience—the Millennium
Dome at Greenwich in London (see p. 355)
and a national programme of events.
National Lottery Act 1998
The Act provides for changes to Lottery
funding of good causes, and reforms the
system of regulatory controls. The new
arrangements are designed to ensure that
money is allocated fairly across all regions of
the UK and among different groups.
A sixth good cause—the New
Opportunities Fund—will support spending
on education, health and the environment.
Projects already agreed will involve
expenditure of:
• £400 million to provide out-of-hours
activities in schools and out-of-school
childcare for 865,000 children;
120
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
• £300 million for a network of healthy
living centres (see p. 187);
• £250 million to train teachers and library
staff in information and communications
technology; and
• £50 million for high-technology
materials for schools and libraries.
The Act establishes NESTA—the National
Endowment for Science, Technology and the
Arts—with initial funding of £200 million
from the Lottery. NESTA will assist talented
individuals in these areas to develop their full
potential; help to turn ideas into marketable
products or services; and contribute to
improving the public’s appreciation of science,
technology and the arts.
The Lottery is currently regulated by the
Director General of the National Lottery, who
heads the Office of the National Lottery
(OFLOT). A new National Lottery
Commission will succeed the Director
General in spring 1999. The Commission is
designed to bring a wider range of experience
and expertise to the regulation of the Lottery,
and it will be able to appoint a not-for-profit
operator if that would provide the best return
for good causes.
Leisure Trends
About 17% of total household expenditure
went on leisure goods and services in 1997-98.
The most common leisure activities are home-
based, or social, such as visiting relatives or
friends. Television viewing is by far the most
popular leisure pastime, with average viewing
time exceeding 25 hours a week. Nearly all
households have one television set or more, and
about 80% of teenagers have a television in
their bedroom. Around 82% of households
have at least one video recorder, the proportion
having doubled in the past ten years.
Listening to radio averages nearly 16 hours a
week. Purchases of compact discs (CDs) have
risen very rapidly, and now account for around
three-quarters of album sales. The proportion
of households with a CD player has grown from
15% in 1989 to 63% in 1997-98.
Other popular pursuits include: reading,
do-it-yourself home improvements, gardening
and going out for a meal, for a drink or to the
More and more UK households are
expanding their communications links,
such as to the Internet, for both business
and leisure use. According to a survey for
the Office for National Statistics in May
and June 1997:
• 94% of households in Great Britain
had a telephone;
• 35% of households with a telephone
had an answer machine or answering
service and 8% had a fax machine;
• 29% of households had a home
computer;
• 15% of households with a home
computer were connected to the
Internet; and
• in 22% of households at least one
person had a mobile telephone for
business and/or personal use.
cinema. About half of households have a pet.
Cats have overtaken dogs to become the most
popular type of pet—the latest estimates being
8 million and 7 million respectively.
Holidays
In 1997 UK residents made 133.6 million
tourist trips of one night or more within the
UK, including 70.8 million holiday trips, 15.4
million business trips and 41.4 million visits to
friends and relatives. The most popular
holiday destinations are the West Country,
eastern England, Scotland, the Heart of
England and Wales.
Of the 46 million visits overseas made by
UK residents in 1997, 29 million were holiday
visits, 7 million were business trips and 6
million were journeys to see friends or
relatives. Over 50% of holiday visits were
package holidays. Spain was the most popular
holiday destination, with some 7.7 million
visits made, followed by France (6.7 million).
Long-haul holidays are growing in
popularity—the fastest growing holiday
destinations outside Europe are Central and
South America, and the Caribbean.
121
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
UK residents made 5 million day trips to
the continent of Europe in 1997, of which
84% were to France and 8% to Belgium.
About 4.1 million journeys to the continent in
1997 were through the Channel Tunnel, 18%
more than in 1996.

Education is the top priority for the Government, which believes that there is
no more important task than raising educational standards to levels that
compare favourably with the UK’s international competitors. New measures
have been introduced to reduce infant class sizes, raise standards in schools and
local education authorities, enhance the status and quality of the teaching
profession, establish a new school framework, promote training for young
employees, and reform student support arrangements. The Government has
also announced proposals to encourage lifelong learning.
ADMINISTRATION
Central government responsibility for
education in the UK rests with the
Department for Education and Employment
(DfEE) in England, The Scottish Office
Education and Industry Department
(SOEID), the Welsh Office Education
Department (WOED) and the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland (DENI).
At present, most state school education in
England, Wales and Scotland is provided by
local government education authorities and
the rest by self-governing and grant-
maintained schools1 (although there are only
two self-governing state schools in Scotland).
In Northern Ireland five education and
1 From 1 September 1999 all state school education in
England and Wales will be provided by local education
authorities with the ending of the separate category of
grant-maintained status (see p. 126).
library boards own, manage and run all
controlled schools; they also fund most
voluntary schools (see p. 127) and provide
finance for advisory and support services for
all schools in their areas.
The education service in Great Britain is
financed in the same way as other local
government services (see chapter 6, p. 65),
with education authorities providing funds to
schools largely on the basis of pupil numbers.
In Northern Ireland the costs of the education
and library boards are met by DENI. There
are also resources allocated to education
authorities in England, Wales and Scotland
for specific purposes, such as training to
improve school performance in literacy and
numeracy or support for information
technology. Additional government grants are
made for capital expenditure at voluntary
aided schools.
At present, grant-maintained schools in
England are financed by the Funding Agency
123
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
for Schools,2 which distributes central
government grants. Similar schools in Wales
are financed by the Welsh Office.
Spending on education in the UK as a
proportion of gross domestic product in
1996—97 was 4.9%. In July 1998 the
Government announced in its
Comprehensive Spending Review (see p.
389) that it is proposing to provide an
additional £19,000 million in funding for
education over the three years from
1999-2000 to 2001-2002 (£16,000 million
for England and £3,000 million for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland).
SCHOOLS
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive full-time education, at school
or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16 in
England, Scotland and Wales and 4 and 16 in
Northern Ireland. About 93% of pupils
receive free education from public funds,
while the others attend independent schools
financed by fees paid by parents.
Pre-School Education
Many 3- and 4-year-old children attend
nursery schools and classes (or, in England,
reception classes in primary schools). Pre¬
school education may also be provided in some
private day nurseries and pre-school
playgroups (which are largely organised by
parents).
The Government has stated its
commitment to a major expansion of pre¬
school education and wants all children to
begin school with a basic foundation in
literacy and numeracy. From September 1998
it is providing free nursery education in
England and Wales for all 4 year olds whose
parents want it, and is committed to staged
targets for provision for 3 year olds thereafter.3
Local education authorities (LEAs), in
partnership with private and voluntary
providers, have drawn up ‘early years
development plans’ for securing these
objectives. The plans are designed to show
how co-operation between private nurseries,
playgroups and schools can best serve the
interests of children and their parents. From
April 1999 early years development
partnerships and plans will be expanded to
deliver quality childcare integrated with early
education. In addition, the Government is
working with local authorities and others in
England to establish ‘early excellence centres’
designed to demonstrate good practice in
education and childcare.
In Scotland local education authorities are
taking the leading role, from August 1998, in
planning and co-ordinating pre-school
education and in providing places, working in
partnership with voluntary and private
providers. The Government’s target is to give
all children in the pre-school year access to
quality, part-time education by the winter of
1998.
Northern Ireland has a lower compulsory
school age of 4 and a single school entry date
in September each year. A pre-school
education expansion programme, undertaken
through partnership between the education
and library boards, other statutory providers
and the private and voluntary sectors, is
providing additional pre-school places from
September 1998.
In July 1998 the Government announced
the establishment of a new UK-wide
programme to co-ordinate nursery
education, childcare, family learning and
primary healthcare initiatives for children
from birth to the age of three. The ‘Sure
Start’ programme will have funding of
£540 million over three years.
2 The agency will be dissolved in October 1999 when a
new framework for the organisation of schools comes into
effect—see p. 126.
3 In July 1998 the Government announced that there would
be an extra 190,000 nursery places for 3 year olds in
England by 2002.
124
EDUCATION
Primary Schools
Compulsory education starts in infant primary
schools or departments; at the age of 7 many
pupils transfer to separate junior primary
schools or departments. The usual age for
transfer from primary to secondary school is
11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
and 12 in Scotland. Some LEAs in England
have first schools for pupils aged 5 to 8, 9 or
10, and middle schools for age-ranges between
8 and 14.
It is Government policy to reduce the size
of primary school classes for 5, 6 and 7 year
olds to 30 or below by September 2001 at the
latest. LEAs must draw up plans, in
partnership with headteachers, school
governors and parents, showing how smaller
classes can be secured in their areas.
Secondary Schools
The majority of state secondary school pupils
in England and Wales attend comprehensive
schools. These largely take pupils without
reference to ability or aptitude, providing a
wide range of secondary education for all or
most of the children in a district. Schools
include those taking the 11 to 18 age-range,
middle schools (8 to 14), and schools with an
age-range of 11 or 12 to 16. Most other state-
educated children in England attend grammar
or secondary modern schools, to which they
are allocated after selection procedures at the
age of 11.
Scottish secondary education is non-
selective, consisting of comprehensive schools
covering the age-range 12 to 18.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is
organised largely along selective lines, with
grammar schools admitting pupils on the basis
of tests in English, maths and science. Most
pupils attend non-grammar secondary schools.
Specialist Schools
The specialist schools programme in England
was launched in 1993. Specialist schools are
state secondary schools specialising in
technology, science and mathematics; modern
foreign languages; sport; or the arts—in
addition to providing the full National
Curriculum (see p. 128). A specialist school
must have the backing of private sector sponsors
if it wishes to become specialised. Capital and
annual grants are available from public funds to
complement business sponsorship.
The Government has stated its commitment
to extending the specialist school programme,
which it believes will promote diversity and
excellence in secondary education. In June 1998
it announced that an additional 51 schools
would be joining the programme and that 10
specialist schools would form a pilot group of
masterclass providers for the most able pupils
in their communities. From September 1998
there will be 330 designated specialist schools
in England, including 227 technology colleges,
58 language colleges, and 26 sports and 19 arts
colleges.
City Technology Colleges
There are 15 city technology colleges in
England; these are non-fee-paying

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
independent secondary schools created by a
partnership of government and business
sponsors. The promoters own or lease the
schools, employ teachers and other staff, and
have made substantial contributions to the
costs of building and equipment. Funding for
running costs is provided by the Government.
The National Curriculum is taught with an
emphasis on maths, technology and science.
Independent Schools
Fee-paying independent schools providing
full-time education for five or more pupils of
compulsory school age must register by law
with the appropriate government department
and are subject to inspection. There are
approximately 2,500 independent schools in
the UK educating roughly 600,000 pupils of
all ages. Many offer academic, music, art and
other scholarships, and bursaries to help
pupils from poorer families.
Following legislation in 1997, no new entry
places are available under the Assisted Places
Scheme. The scheme, providing financial
assistance from public funds according to
parental income, is being phased out in order
to channel the money saved into cutting class
sizes for all 5, 6 and 7 year olds in state schools
(see p. 125). Existing holders of assisted
places will receive continued support to allow
them to complete their current stage of
education.
The Government gives income-related help
with fees to pupils at eight music and ballet
schools; there are a limited number of similar
scholarships at cathedral choir schools.
Independent schools range from small
kindergartens to large day and boarding
schools, and from new and, in some cases,
experimental schools to ancient foundations.
A number have been established by religious
orders and ethnic minorities. Independent
schools for older pupils from 11, 12 or 13 to 18
or 19 include about 500 which are often
referred to as ‘public schools’.
The Government is encouraging the
development of independent/state sector
school partnerships in England. In particular
it is suggesting that independent schools, as an
expression of their charitable status, could
offer opportunities for more children by
sharing their facilities with the local
community and maintained schools.
School Management
England and Wales
At present there are four main types of state
school: county schools owned and funded by
LEAs; voluntary schools, established by
church and other foundations and funded
mainly by LEAs; grant-maintained schools
funded by central government; and
special schools (LEA and grant-maintained)
for pupils with special educational needs (see
p. 132).
The School Standards and Framework Act
passed in July 1998 establishes a new
framework for school organisation. This will
take effect from September 1999. The
Government’s aim is to maintain diversity in
its promotion of higher standards (see p. 130)
while ensuring fairness and coherence, and
minimising disruption to individual schools:
Categories—Under the new legislation,
there will be three mainstream categories:
community, foundation and voluntary schools.
The community category will initially
accommodate county schools, while the
foundation category is expected to include
grant-maintained schools. All schools will be
able to choose which category will best suit
their circumstances and aspirations. The
arrangements will be phased. There will also
be two categories of special school under the
new framework: community special and
foundation special.
Funding and responsibilities—All state
schools will work in partnership with, and
receive their recurrent funding from, LEAs.
Schools will continue to manage their own
budgets and staffing. The new framework for
local management of schools will be based on a
clear distinction between functions that LEAs
must carry out and fund centrally and those
for which schools are responsible, using their
delegated budgets.
Governing bodies—Schools will continue to
be run by governing bodies. The number of
parent governors will be increased. Other
governors will represent the local community,
school staff and the LEA. The governing
126
EDUCATION
bodies of church schools will also include
church representatives.
Admissions—LEAs and school governing
bodies responsible for admissions will be
required to work with headteachers, the
Churches and others in local forums to co¬
ordinate admissions arrangements, taking
account of a statutory code of practice to be
issued by the Government. In England,
disagreements will be referred to a new
independent adjudicator on school
organisation and admissions (although disputes
about religious or denominational criteria will
be referred to the Secretary of State for
determination). In Wales, the new National
Assembly will decide in all cases of
disagreement. Admission authorities of schools
with a specialism in certain subjects will be
able to give priority in admissions to up to
10% of pupils by aptitude for their specialism.
Admission authorities will no longer be
allowed to introduce selection by ability, and
where existing partial selection by ability is
challenged, the adjudicator will decide whether
it should continue. Local parents will be
allowed to petition for a ballot and (if sufficient
numbers locally wish it) to vote on whether
individual grammar schools should keep
selective admission arrangements or (in wholly
selective areas) whether the selective system
should continue.
Scotland
Nearly all schools in Scotland are education
authority schools, which are financed by the
authorities and central government. Education
authorities are required to establish school
boards to participate in the administration and
management of schools. Consisting of elected
parent and staff members as well as co-opted
members, boards are required to promote
contact between parents, the school and the
community, and are involved in the
appointment of senior staff and the community
use of school premises. Devolved management
(from the education authority to the school) is in
place in primary, secondary and special schools.
• controlled schools, which are owned by
the education and library boards;
• voluntary maintained schools, most of
which are owned by the Roman Catholic
Church;
• voluntary grammar schools, which may
be owned by denominational or non-
denominational bodies; and
• grant-maintained or controlled integrated
schools, which take Protestant and
Roman Catholic pupils.
All publicly financed schools are managed
by boards of governors, which include elected
parents and teachers among their members.
Virtually all schools have delegated budgets
under which school governors decide
spending priorities.
All schools must be open to pupils of all
religions. However, most Roman Catholic
pupils attend Catholic maintained schools or
Catholic voluntary grammar schools, and most
Protestant children are enrolled at controlled
schools or non-denominational voluntary
grammar schools. The Government has a
statutory duty to encourage integrated
education as a way of breaking down sectarian
barriers. Existing controlled, grant-maintained
and voluntary grammar schools can apply to
become integrated following a majority vote
by parents. By September 1998, 34 integrated
schools were established (out of a total of
about 1,300 schools in Northern Ireland).

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Rights and Duties of Parents
Parents must be given general information
about a school through a prospectus and the
school’s annual report or, in Scotland, the
school’s handbook. They also have a statutory
right to express a preference for a particular
school for their child, and there is an appeal
system if their choice is not met.
In England and Wales parents choosing a
local secondary school have the right to see:
• national performance tables showing the
latest public examination results,
vocational qualification results and rates
of absence on a school-by-school basis;
and
• information in each local school’s
prospectus on its public examination
results, vocational qualification results,
attendance rates and the destinations of
school leavers.
Parents must also be given a written annual
school report on their child’s achievements,
containing details about progress in all
subjects and activities; attendance record;
results of National Curriculum assessments
and of public examinations; comparative
results of pupils of the same age in the school
and nationally; and arrangements for
discussing pupils’ reports with teachers.
Under the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998, parents in both England
and Wales will become more involved with
their child’s education through a written
home-school agreement setting out clearly
what is expected of the school, parents and
pupils. All schools will be required to have
such agreements. The number of elected
parent governors will be increased, with at
least one elected parent governor serving on
each LEA policy-making education
committee.
In Scotland information is published for
parents on school costs, examination results,
pupil attendance and absence, and the
destinations of school leavers. Schools should
also provide parents with information about
their children’s attainment in the various
subjects, teachers’ comments on their progress
and details about steps to build on success or
overcome difficulties. One main school report
each year is advised, together with one brief
update report.
The Northern Ireland system for reporting
to parents is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales.
School Curriculum
England and Wales
The National Curriculum consists of statutory
subjects for 5 to 16 year olds. For 5 to 11 year
olds in state schools in England, the core
subjects are English, mathematics, science and,
from September 1998, information technology
and religious education; other statutory
subjects are design and technology, geography,
history, physical education, art and music.
From the age of 11 all pupils must also study a
modern foreign language. Statutory subjects at
ages 14 to 16 are English, maths, science,
design and technology, a foreign language,
information technology and physical education.
In order to give a clear priority to the
teaching of literacy and numeracy (see below),
from September 1998, primary schools in
England and Wales will have greater flexibility
and discretion in what to teach in the non-core
curriculum subjects (instead of set
programmes of study). However, the teaching
of those subjects remains compulsory. This
represents the first step in developing a
revised National Curriculum for introduction
to all schools in September 2000.
In Wales, the National Curriculum takes
account of teaching the Welsh language. Welsh
is taught in primary schools as a first or second
language. English is not a statutory language for
5-7 year olds in Welsh speaking schools. At
secondary level, Welsh is compulsory for pupils
aged 11-16 in Welsh speaking schools and for
those aged 11-14 in other schools. However,
from 1999 Welsh will be compulsory for all
pupils up to the age of 16.
Religious education—All state schools in
England and Wales must provide religious
education, each LEA being responsible for
producing a locally agreed syllabus. Syllabuses
must reflect Christianity while taking account
of the other main religions practised in the
UK. Parents have the right to withdraw their
children from religious education classes.
128
EDUCATION
Sex education—State secondary schools are
required to provide sex education for all
pupils, including education about HIV/AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Parents are entitled to withdraw their children
from sex education classes other than those
required by the National Curriculum. All state
schools must provide information to parents
about the content of their sex education
courses.
Literacy and numeracy—The Government
has set targets to improve literacy and
numeracy for 11 year olds in England in order
to provide them with a more satisfactory
preparation for secondary education. By 2002,
the targets are for 80% of 11 year olds to reach
the standards for their age in English and 75%
in maths. From September 1998 primary
schools in England must devote an hour to
literacy during each teaching day, and from
September 1999 there will also be a daily
numeracy lesson. Literacy and numeracy
summer schools will be available to help those
11 year olds about to move on to secondary
education who have failed to make the
standard for English and mathematics for
their age. In Wales the Government has
adopted targets for attainment in the separate
subjects of English, Welsh (first language),
maths and science. By 2000 between 60% and
70% of 11 and 14 year olds should reach the
standards for their age, rising to between 70%
and 80% by 2002.
In September 1998 the Government
marked the launch of the National Year of
Reading (a campaign to improve the
literacy skills of children and adults) with
the provision of £24 million for
maintained primary and secondary schools
in England to spend on reading books in
the 1998-99 academic year. Schools with
more than 100 pupils will each receive
£1,000; smaller schools will receive £10
per pupil.
Assessment and testing—Pupils’
performance is assessed at the ages of 7, 11
and 14 by their teachers in the core
curriculum subjects; 14 year olds are also
assessed in statutory non-core subjects. In
addition, 7 year olds take National
Curriculum tests in English and maths, and
most 11 and 14 year olds are tested in the core
subjects. In Welsh-speaking schools the three
age-groups are tested in Welsh. The
Government is introducing statutory
assessment of children on entry to primary
school from September 1998; this is intended
to help teachers to match their work to
children’s needs and abilities.
Qualifications—The General Certificate of
Secondary Education (GCSE) is the main
examination taken by pupils at the end of
compulsory schooling at the age of 16. GCSE
(Short Courses) are also available in a limited
range of subjects; they occupy half the time of
full GCSEs. In addition, the Part 1 General
National Vocational Qualification—a
shortened version of the full GNVQ^(see p.
137)—is being piloted extensively for 14—16
year olds. It covers seven vocational areas: art
and design; business; engineering; health and
social care; information technology; leisure
and tourism; and manufacturing.
All GCSE and other qualifications offered
to pupils in state schools must be approved by
the Government. Associated syllabuses and
assessment procedures must comply with
national guidelines and be approved by the
relevant qualifications authority. The
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority
(QCA), and its Welsh counterpart, are
independent government agencies responsible
for ensuring that the curriculum and
qualifications available to young people and
adults are of high quality, coherent and
flexible.
Work experience—The Government is
committed to extending the range and quality
of vocational and work-related opportunities
for pupils in the 14-16 age-group. From
October 1998, the School Standards and
Framework Act will enable schools to offer
more flexible work-related learning choices,
by allowing pupils to take up placements at
any time in their last two years of compulsory
schooling. Barriers to collaboration between
further education colleges and schools to offer
suitable learning opportunities will be
removed.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• The average number of pupils per
school in state (publicly maintained)
schools in the UK in 1996—97 was 71
for nursery, 229 for primary and 836
for secondary level.
• The average class size in primary
schools in Great Britain in 1995-96

pupils.
• The average number of pupils per
teacher in nursery schools in the UK
in 1996-97 was 21.3. In primary
schools it was 22.8 and in secondary
schools 16.2. The average number of
pupils per teacher for all schools was
18.1, compared with 17.5 in 1985-86.
Scotland
Content and management of the curriculum
are not prescribed by statute, responsibility
resting with education authorities and
headteachers. Guidance is available from the
Secretary of State and from the Scottish
Consultative Council on the Curriculum.
A review of the curriculum for 5 to 14 year
olds was carried out in 1997 and government
guidelines have been issued on English,
maths, expressive arts, Latin, Gaelic, modern
languages, environmental studies, and
religious and moral education. There are
standardised tests in English and maths at five
levels within this age-group. A programme to
extend modern language teaching to primary
schools is in progress. For 14 to 16 year olds
the curriculum includes study of language and
communications, maths, science, technology,
social studies, creative activities, physical
education, and religious and moral instruction.
Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in
Gaelic-speaking areas and in some other areas
where education authorities have identified
this as a priority. More resources are being put
into Gaelic teaching.
Scottish education authorities must ensure
that pupils are given religious instruction,
although parents can withdraw their children
if they wish. Government guidance on sex
education is provided to education authorities
and headteachers, who are responsible for the
content of the curriculum.
Pupils take the Scottish Certificate of
Education (SCE) at Standard Grade after four
years of secondary education at the age of 16.
SCE Standard Grade examinations are
conducted by the Scottish Qualifications
Authority (SQA).
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland curriculum,
compulsory in all publicly financed schools,
consists of religious education and six broad
areas of study: English, maths, science and
technology, the environment and society,
creative and expressive studies and, in
secondary schools and some primary schools,
language studies. A core syllabus for religious
education has been approved by the main
churches and this must be taught in all grant-
aided schools.
The curriculum also has cross-curricular
themes including cultural heritage, education
for mutual understanding, health education
and information technology. Secondary
schools have two additional themes, namely,
economic awareness and careers education.
Sex education is taught through the
compulsory science programme of study and
the health education cross-curricular theme.
Following reviews of the curriculum, its
overall content has been reduced in primary
schools and more flexibility in subject choice
has been given to secondary schools. Teaching
of the compulsory curriculum takes up about
85% of teaching time in primary schools and
60%-65% in secondary schools.
Pupil assessment, which is statutory, is
broadly in line with practice in England and
Wales, taking place at 8, 11, 14 and 16. The
GSCE exam is used to assess 16-year-olds.
Raising School Standards
England and Wales
The Standards and Effectiveness Unit within
the DfEE was set up in 1997 to ensure that all
parts of the education service in England
contribute fully to raising standards in
130
EDUCATION
schools. It is staffed by civil servants and
practitioners from schools, local authorities
and other areas of education. The Welsh
Office Education Department fulfils this
function in Wales.
In England the independent Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED) and in
Wales the Office of Her Majesty’s Chief
Inspector advise the Government on quality,
standards and efficiency. The two
inspectorates also organise and regulate a
system of school inspections. Each school is
regularly inspected by a team of independent
inspectors containing educationalists and lay
people. Parents are sent a summary of the
report, which is also published in full. The
school governing body must prepare an action
plan to follow it up and report back to parents
on progress.
From September 1998 schools will
normally be inspected every six years, but
more often where weaknesses are apparent.
Between inspections, school performance will
be regularly monitored by LEAs, which will
ensure that the school’s improvement plans
meet national guidelines set out by the
Government.
Each school in England and Wales will
have its own targets to raise standards and will
be responsible for achieving them. All LEAs
will be required to have an education
development plan (or strategic plan in Wales)
approved by the Government by April 1999.
Each plan will set out how an LEA intends to
raise pupil performance and promote school
improvement, and will include the
performance targets set by its schools in
agreement with the LEA. OFSTED and its
Welsh counterpart will inspect the operations
of LEAs to ensure that they are driving up
educational standards.
In schools which have been identified as
failing to deliver an acceptable standard of
education, the LEA will be able to issue
formal warnings and, if necessary, appoint
extra governors and withdraw a school’s
delegated budget. Where a school found
failing by inspectors does not make adequate
progress, central government may either put
the school under new management or require
the LEA to close it, or make a fresh start by
opening a reconstituted school.
A central part of the Government’s new
legislation provides for the establishment
of education action zones in disadvantaged
urban and rural areas in England. The
zones will comprise groups of schools
working together with local partners and
agencies with the aim of improving
standards in education. A forum will be
responsible for running each zone and
ensuring that targets for improvement are
met. The forum could include
representatives of parents, the business
and social community, schools and the
LEA. In addition, the Secretary of State
could appoint one or two representatives
to provide advice and support. The
Government plans to phase in the
programme over two to three years. The
first 12 zones are beginning in September
1998, and a further 13 in January 1999.
Scotland
The document Setting Targets—Raising
Standards in Schools sets out the
Government’s framework for improvement in
schools. From 1998-99 all schools will set
targets in literacy, numeracy, examination
attainment and attendance.
HM Inspectors of Schools (HMI) are
responsible for independent evaluation of
education standards and for advising the
Secretary of State on all aspects of education.
Reports are published on inspections and given
to parents. Inspectors return to the school two
years after the publication of the report to
assess progress in meeting their
recommendations. Their conclusions about
progress are published together with an
indication of any further action which may be
required. The school continues to be monitored
by HMI until the recommendations have been
satisfactorily addressed.
Each year HMI inspect and publish reports
on a wide range of educational establishments,
including pre-5 centres, primary, secondary
and special schools, further education colleges
and community education. They are also
involved in assessing the quality of teacher
education.
131
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Education and
Training Inspectorate evaluates, reports and
advises DENI on quality and standards in
schools. Inspection reports are published and
a summary prepared for parents. Where an
inspection has identified important
weaknesses, school governors are required to
prepare an action plan and submit details to
the DENI. In such cases, a follow-up
inspection will take place about a year after the
original inspection and, if sufficient
improvement has not been made, a report will
be published. The governors will be required
to submit a further action plan and the
school’s work will continue to be monitored
and evaluated by the Inspectorate and the
DENI in order to ensure that improvement
takes place.
From September 1998 all schools will be
required to set targets for improving their
performance and monitor their progress
towards them. In addition, a new school
improvement programme, announced in
February 1998, provides for targeted support
to the weakest schools, together with a
strategy for the promotion of good behaviour,
literacy and numeracy especially at primary
school, and the development of leadership.
Study Support
The Government considers that, if the targets
set for achievement in school are to be met,
there must be effective learning opportunities
outside school hours to complement and
support the work of teachers in the classroom.
It is investing £200 million from the National
Lottery’s New Opportunities Fund (see p.
120) to help expand study support activities
for pupils outside normal lessons, both in
schools and within the wider community.
Study support centres can often provide the
opportunity for quiet study which may not be
available at home. They can also offer a
suitable place for mentors (whose purpose is
to inspire and motivate young people) to give
help and advice, or provide wider access for
pupils to information and communications
technology. In the London borough of Tower
Hamlets, for example, study support centres
are a significant strand of the LEA’s strategy
to tackle underachievement among pupils.
Another initiative is the establishment of
support centres within some Premier League
football clubs, focusing on improving pupils’
literacy and numeracy.
Ethnic Minority Children
Children from ethnic minority backgrounds
form over a tenth of the school population in
England and smaller proportions in Wales and
Scotland. While the achievements of some
groups are exceptional, others are
underperforming. Government action to
improve education for ethnic minority pupils
includes spreading successful school practice
in raising these pupils’ achievements;
developing ethnic monitoring of performance;
and providing guidance on promoting equal
opportunities and tackling problems of racial
harassment.
English language teaching continues to
receive priority for pupils without English as
their first language, and is supported through
specific funding (see also p. 113). In addition,
schools may teach the main ethnic minority
community languages at secondary level in
England and Wales as part of the National
Curriculum. They should take account of the
ethnic and cultural backgrounds of pupils, and
curricula should reflect ethnic and cultural
diversity.
Children with Special Needs
Special educational needs (SEN) comprise
learning difficulties of all kinds, including
mental and physical disabilities which hinder
or prevent learning. There are some 1,530
special schools (both day and boarding) in the
UK for SEN pupils. Some of these are run by
voluntary organisations and some are
established in hospitals. They cater for about
115,700 pupils.
England and Wales—LEAs in England and
Wales must identify children whose learning
difficulties are severe or complex, assess and
meet their needs, and involve parents in
decisions about their child’s education. If the
LEA believes that it should determine the
education for the child, it must draw up a

EDUCATION
formal statement of the child’s special needs
and the action it intends to take to meet them.
A state school named in the statement is
required to admit the child. In England and
Wales parents have a right of appeal to the
Special Educational Needs Tribunal if they
disagree with the LEA’s decision about their
child. The Tribunal’s verdict is final and
binding on all parties.
Wherever possible, children with special
needs are taught in ordinary schools. The
LEA is required to comply with the parents’
choice of school unless this is inappropriate
for the child, or involves an inefficient use of
resources or is incompatible with the efficient
education of other children.
A Government code of practice offers
guidance to all LEAs and state schools in
England and Wales on how to identify, assess
and monitor all SEN pupils. Each school must
provide information to parents about its
policies on meeting special needs.
In October 1997 the Government launched
a review of SEN in England and Wales with
the publication of two Green Papers
(Excellence for all children—meeting Special
Educational Needs for England, and The Best
for Special Education for Wales). The main
themes include:
• the importance of early identification and
action to tackle difficulties;
• increased inclusion of children with SEN
in mainstream schools; and
• better partnerships with parents.
The Government’s response to the review
is expected in the form of an action
programme in autumn 1998.
Scotland—The choice of school is a matter
for agreement between education authorities
and parents. Education authorities must take
special educational needs fully into account
when making provision for pupils in their
areas. There are a small number of pupils
(about 2% of the school population) whose
needs require the authority to open a record
describing the special education necessary to
meet them. This process incorporates a right
of appeal.
In May 1998 the Government launched a
consultative document on improving
provision for children with special needs in
Scotland; an advisory committee to examine
the co-ordination and provision of education
for children with severe disabilities was also
established.
Northern Ireland—Similar arrangements to
those in England and Wales, including an
appeal system, are in force.
Information Technology in Schools
Curricular requirements in all parts of the UK
place a strong emphasis on the use of
information and communications technology
(ICT).
National Grid for Learning
The Government is creating a new National
Grid for Learning, with the co-operation of
the telecommunications industry, in order to
harness the best in communications and
computer technology, and to bring high
quality training and curriculum materials to
both teachers and pupils.
Comprising interconnecting learning
networks and education services based on the
Internet (see p. 289), the Grid will support
teaching, learning, training and administration
in schools, colleges, universities, libraries, the
workplace and homes. It is expected to be
operational by autumn 1998 and the aim is to
get all schools in the UK connected by the
year 2002.
The Grid will:
• connect schools, colleges and libraries,
keeping access charges as low as possible;
• deliver educational software and services
to teachers, pupils and other learners
through public/private partnership; and
• remove barriers to learning, giving
equality of access for all, including people
in isolated areas and those with special
needs.
Other Initiatives
Funds totalling .£230 million from the
National Lottery (see p. 120) will be made
133
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
available from early 1999 to 2002 to support
training in ICT for serving teachers in the
UK. Newly qualified teachers will enter the
profession from 1999 onwards with
knowledge, understanding and skills set out in
the Initial Teacher Training National
Curriculum for the use of ICT in Subject
Teaching. In addition the Government has
made £23 million available to provide nearly
10,000 teachers and senior school managers
with multimedia portable computers and
printers to help develop their skills and
confidence.
The four Government education
departments jointly fund the British
Educational Communications and Technology
Agency (formerly the National Council for
Educational Technology), which supports the
development of ICT good practice in schools
and further education. The Scottish Council
for Educational Technology also develops
software and other applications geared to the
curriculum and school organisation in
Scotland.
The BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation) and the independent Channel 4
television service (see chapter 17) broadcast
educational programmes. Teachers’ notes,
pupils’ pamphlets and computer software
accompany many of these broadcasts.
Health and Welfare of Schoolchildren
LEAs or governing bodies are required by law to
ensure the health and safety of pupils at school;
day to day management of this responsibility is
usually delegated to the headteacher. School
staff are required to act as any reasonably
prudent parent would to ensure that children are
safe on school premises and during activities
taking place off-site. The LEA or governing
body must make arrangements to encourage and
help pupils take advantage of any provision for
medical or dental inspection and treatment made
for them (unless their parents object).
The School Standards and Framework Act
1998 has given the Secretary of State the
power to set nutritional requirements for
school lunches for registered pupils at
maintained schools. The Act has also placed a
duty on LEAs to provide school lunches for
pupils who wish to buy them. Children whose
parents receive certain social security benefits
(Income Support or income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance—see pp. 177-8) must receive free
lunches and (where provided) milk.
Throughout the UK, advice and guidance on
preventing and dealing with drug misuse (see
also pp. 203/217) are made available to schools.
LEAs provide free of charge the transport
they consider necessary to enable pupils to
attend school, and they may help other pupils
with their fares.
Teachers
England and Wales
Teachers in state schools in England and
Wales are appointed by LEAs or school
governing bodies. All entrants complete an
approved course of teacher training. These
courses are offered by university departments
of education as well as other higher education
establishments (see p. 139) and groups of
schools. One of the two main qualifications is
the three- or four-year Bachelor of Education
(BEd) honours degree. The other is the
successful completion of a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate in Education
(PGCE) course.
Schools play an important role in initial
teacher training (ITT) by helping to plan and
manage courses and select, train and assess
students, usually in partnership with colleges
and universities. Consortia of schools can run
courses for postgraduate students if they wish
to do so. Other courses, including all
undergraduate courses, are run by universities
and colleges in partnership with schools. New
legislation—the Teaching and Higher
Education Act 1998—has given statutory
powers to OFSTED and the Office of Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector to inspect providers
of initial teacher training.
New and more rigorous criteria were
published in 1997 for all courses of initial
teacher training setting out the standards of
knowledge, understanding and skills that all
trainees must demonstrate from May 1998
(May 1999 in Wales) before being awarded
qualified teacher status. As part of the
134
EDUCATION
programme to improve literacy and numeracy
in schools, new ITT curricula for English and
maths are being implemented from September
1998 in England. In Wales, primary ITT
curricula for English, Welsh and maths will be
introduced from September 1999. The new
Teacher and Higher Education Act will, from
1999, require newly qualified teachers to serve
a statutory induction period (normally a year)
to consolidate their skills.
Teacher Training Agency (TTA)—The
TTA is responsible for accrediting training
providers and for financing initial teacher
training courses in England. It also ensures
that national standards are met and promotes
teaching as a career. The Higher Education
Funding Council for Wales finances ITT
courses in Wales and is responsible for
accrediting providers.
Headteachers—The TTA has launched the
National Professional Qualification for
Headteachers (NPQH) and, under the new
legislation, a requirement for all first-time
heads in England and Wales to hold a
headship qualification is being introduced.
The TTA is also developing a training
programme for serving headteachers. In the
light of the establishment of the NPQH, the
Agency is reviewing its HEADLAMP
scheme, which funds training for newly
appointed heads in England.
Appraisal—A more robust teacher appraisal
system, to improve school standards and
teachers’ professional development, will be
introduced in England from September 1999.
The arrangements will integrate teacher
appraisal with other school management
processes. Changes to the teacher appraisal
system will also be introduced in Wales.
Advanced Skills Teachers—In order to
reward good teachers and to encourage
graduates to consider teaching as a profession,
the Government is introducing a new career
grade of Advanced Skills Teacher from
September 1998. The aim is to give the best
teachers the option to stay in the classroom
rather than take up management posts.
General Teaching Council—Under the new
legislation, separate General Teaching
Councils (GTCs) for England and Wales will
be established by 2000. The GTCs will be
independent professional bodies for teachers,
aiming to promote a positive image for
teaching both within the profession and
outside. They will advise the Government on
a wide range of teaching issues and maintain a
register of teachers, and will also remove
teachers from the register on the grounds of
unacceptable professional conduct or serious
professional incompetence.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools
must be registered with the General Teaching
Council (GTC) for Scotland. The GTC gives
advice to the Secretary of State on teacher
supply and the professional suitability of
teacher training courses. It is also responsible
for disciplinary procedures under which
teachers guilty of professional misconduct
may be removed temporarily or permanently
from the register.
All entrants to the teaching profession are
graduates. New primary teachers qualify
either through a four-year BEd course or a
one-year postgraduate course at a higher
education teacher training institution.
Teachers of academic subjects at secondary
schools must hold a degree with at least two
passes in each subject that they wish to teach.
Secondary school teachers must undertake a
one-year postgraduate training course or an
undergraduate course combining subject
studies, study of education and school
experience. Newly qualified teachers must
serve a two-year probationary period at the
beginning of their teaching careers.
In Scotland all pre-service teaching courses
must be approved by SOEID. They must also
be validated by a higher education institution
and accredited by the GTC as leading to
registration. Under the Teaching and Higher
Education Act 1998, HM Inspectorate in
Scotland has powers to inspect teacher
education and training.
Revised national guidelines for teacher
development and appraisal were issued in
January 1998, and the development of a new
qualification for aspiring headteachers—the
Scottish Qualification for Headship—is
proceeding.
The Scottish Higher Education Funding
Council is responsible for funding initial
135
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
teacher education and setting intake levels to
teacher education courses.
Northern Ireland
All new entrants to teaching in grant-aided
schools are graduates and hold an approved
teaching qualification. Arrangements are being
developed under which initial teacher training
would be integrated with induction/early in-
service training, the latter covering a period of
three years. In addition, work is under way on
a recognised qualification for headteachers,
equivalent to the arrangements in England and
Wales. The Government has stated its
commitment to the establishment of a General
Teaching Council in Northern Ireland.
Teacher training is provided by Queen’s
University, in Belfast, the University of
Ulster, two colleges of education and the
Open University (see p. 140). The principal
courses are BEd Honours (four years) and the
one-year Postgraduate Certificate of
Education. The Open University course is
part-time and lasts 18 months. Education and
library boards have a statutory duty to provide
curricular support services and in-service
training.
Business and Community Links
The Government recognises that school-
business links can help raise pupils’ levels of
achievement and enable them to see the
relevance of what they learn at school. It is
continuing to support the Education Business
Partnership Network. Education Business
Partnerships comprise representatives from
industry, education and the wider community,
and aim to bring about closer links between
education and industry in order to ensure that
young people develop the necessary skills to
help them succeed in the labour market.
The Government has also stated its
commitment to increasing the availability to
pupils of mentoring initiatives, whereby
people experienced in business can help to
inspire and motivate groups or individuals.
In Scotland, the Education for Work (EfW)
programme has been launched for the ongoing
development of education-business links
activity.
Careers
All young people in full-time education are
entitled to careers information, advice and
guidance. However, from 1998—99, the
Government has asked career services to focus
on those young people who are in need of
most help. In addition, from September 1998,
all schools are required to provide broad and
balanced programmes of careers education for
9-11 year olds. All schools have been
encouraged to draw up partnership
agreements with their local careers service in
developing programmes of careers education
and guidance.
In Northern Ireland careers education is
one of the six compulsory education themes
forming part of the secondary school
curriculum (see p. 130).
All state secondary schools in England and
Wales, and primary and secondary schools in
Northern Ireland, provide leavers with a
Record of Achievement setting out their
school attainments, including public
examination and National Curriculum
assessment results. In Scotland the Record is
not compulsory.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AFTER 16
The Government has stated that all young
people should have access to high-quality
education and training after the age of 16.
Young people have two routes that they can
follow—one based on school and college
education, and the other on work-based
learning. In addition, under the Welfare-to-
Work programme (see p. 155), all young
unemployed people are being guaranteed
education and training opportunities, while
those with poor basic skills have the option of
participating in full-time study on an
approved course.
About 70% of 16-year-old pupils choose to
continue in full-time education in school sixth
forms, sixth-form colleges, further education
colleges and other education institutions.
Broadly speaking, education after 16
outside schools is divided into further and
higher education. Further education is largely
vocational and in England, Wales and
136
EDUCATION
Northern Ireland covers courses up to and
including General Certificate of Education
(GCE) Advanced (A) level and Advanced
Supplementary (AS) qualifications, and
General National Vocational Qualifications
(GNVQ) Advanced level or their equivalents
(see below). Higher education covers advanced
courses at levels higher than GCE A level or
equivalent.
Youth credits are on offer from Training
and Enterprise Councils in England and
Wales and from Local Enterprise Companies
in Scotland (see p. 153). These enable 16 and
17 year olds leaving full-time education to
obtain vocational education and training
through their employer or a specialist trainer.
In many English and most Welsh post¬
school establishments, parts of each course
attract credits which can be accumulated by the
student and transferred between institutions. In
Scotland a credit accumulation scheme covers
courses in all further and higher education.
Similar schemes in higher education in
Northern Ireland are compatible with those of
institutions in the rest of the UK.
The national computer-based Educational
Counselling and Credit Transfer Information
Service (ECCTIS) provides prospective
students and their advisers with free access to
information on course opportunities at
universities and colleges throughout the UK.
ECCTIS can be found in most secondary
schools with sixth forms, as well as most
further education colleges, universities,
careers offices, Training and Enterprise
Councils, and, in other countries, British
Council offices.
Further Education
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Having completed compulsory school
education, students may continue to study for
examinations that lead to higher education,
professional training or vocational
qualifications. These include the academic
GCE A level, the AS examination, GNVQs
and job-specific National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs—see p. 138). The GCE
A level is usually taken at the age of 18 or 19
after two years’ study; part of the qualification
may be based on coursework and the rest on
written test papers. AS levels usually involve
one year’s study and enable sixth-form pupils
to study a wider range of subjects. A-level arts
students, for example, can still study science
subjects at AS level.
GNVQs, which are mainly undertaken by
young people in full-time education between
the ages of 16 and 18, provide a broad-based
preparation for a range of occupations and
higher education. There are three GNVQ
levels—Advanced, Intermediate and
Foundation. An Advanced GNVQjequires a
level of achievement broadly equal to two
GCE A levels. GNVQs may also be taken in
combination with other qualifications, such as
GCE A levels or GCSEs.
The Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority (QCA—see p. 129) is responsible
for supervising academic and vocational
qualifications in England as well as the school
curriculum. Corresponding bodies in Wales
and Northern Ireland perform similar
functions.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Scotland
Pupils staying on at school after the end of
compulsory education study for the Higher
Grade Scottish Certificate of Education
examination (‘Highers’) between the ages of
16 and 18; passes at this grade are the basis for
entry to higher education or professional
training. The Certificate of Sixth Year Studies
(CSYS) is for pupils who have completed
their Higher Grade main studies and who
wish to pursue particular subjects.
A flexible system of vocational courses for
16 to 18 year olds has been introduced in
schools and colleges in subjects such as
business and administration, engineering and
industrial production. These courses are also
intended to meet the needs of many adults
entering training or returning to education.
They lead to the award of the non-advanced
National Certificate for students over 16 who
have successfully completed a programme of
vocational courses based on short study units.
Similar unit-based courses are also available at
advanced levels, leading to the award of a
Higher National Certificate or Diploma.
General Scottish Vocational Qualifications
(General SVQs) are designed to meet the
needs of 16 to 19 year olds at school or in
further education colleges. Broadly compatible
with GNVQs in the rest of the UK, General
SVQs are a stepping-stone to higher education
or further training. They are accredited and
awarded by the Scottish Qualifications
Authority (SQA).
A new five-level system of courses and
awards for fifth- and sixth-year pupils and for
college students—‘Higher Still’—will be
introduced in August 1999. Under this,
Highers remain as one of the levels, but courses
are based on units of study of 40 or 80 hours.
The recommended study time for each Higher
is extended from 120 to 160 hours. Advanced
Higher courses are being developed,
incorporating the current Certificate of Sixth
Year Studies and building on Highers to
provide a two-year 320-hour course. The SQA
validates and awards course certificates.
Further Education Colleges
People over the age of 16 can also take courses
in further education colleges, where much of
the study is work-related. Further education
colleges also offer many government-
sponsored training programmes.
Many students on further education
courses attend part-time, either by day release
or block release from employment or during
the evenings. The system has strong ties with
commerce and industry, and co-operation
with business is encouraged by the
Government and its agencies. Employers are
normally involved in designing courses.
Courses are run by some 550 institutions of
further education, many of which also offer
higher education courses (see p. 139). In
England and Wales each is controlled by an
autonomous corporation and governing body
with substantial representation from business.
Public funding is allocated to institutions by
further education funding councils, most of it
being directly related to student numbers and
achievements.
At present SOEID distributes funds
directly to colleges in Scotland, which are
controlled by autonomous boards of
management. From 1999, responsibility for
funding will transfer to a new Scottish
Further Education Funding Council.
In Northern Ireland further education
colleges are financed through the education
and library boards by DENI; in April 1998
they became free-standing institutions
financed directly by the Department.
Funding councils in England and Wales send
out independent inspectors to assess the quality
of the education provided by colleges. They
publish reports containing quality assessments,
and colleges are obliged to explain how they will
put things right if there are major criticisms.
Each college has to publish information about
its examination results annually. Colleges in
Scotland are inspected by the Schools
Inspectorate and in Northern Ireland by the
Education and Training Inspectorate.
Vocational Qualifications
England, Wales and Northern Ireland have a
wide range of National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs), awards which recognise
work-related skills and knowledge and provide
a path for lifelong learning and achievement.
Prepared by industry and commerce, including
138
EDUCATION
representatives from trade unions and
professional bodies, NVQs are based on
national standards of competence and can be
achieved at levels 1 to 5. Level 1 awards cover
routine tasks carried out under supervision,
while Level 5 NVQs encompass complex work
roles, often involving detailed technical
knowledge and a high level of responsibility.
In Scotland there is an analogous system of
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs).
NVQs and SVQs have mutual recognition
throughout the UK.
NVQs are offered by a range of awarding
bodies approved by the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority. In Scotland the SQA
is the national accreditation body and the main
awarding organisation.
National Targets for Education and
Training
The National Targets for Education and
Training were originally launched in 1991,
with the aim of raising standards and
improving the UK’s international
competitiveness. The foundation and lifelong
learning targets set by the previous
Government, which related to the year 2000,
are being superseded by new National
Learning Targets to be announced in autumn
1998. This follows an extensive consultation
exercise by the DfEE (completed in early
1998) on how best to develop them. The
consultation document (Targets for our Future)
set out some of the main options for new
targets and proposed that they should relate to
the year 2002.
A consultation paper on new targets for
Scotland is being issued in autumn 1998.
Separate targets for Wales will be set in 1999.
Work-based Training for Young People
The Government’s programme currently
comprises:
• Modern Apprenticeships, offering an
NVQJevel 3 qualification in accordance
with a training framework agreed by the
relevant sector of industry or commerce;
• National Traineeships, introduced in
September 1997 and offering an NVQ^
level 2 qualification, also in accordance
with standards set by the appropriate
industrial or commercial sector; and
• other training opportunities for those
unable to access Modern Apprenticeships
or National Traineeships.
New legislation is giving 16 and 17 year
olds in a job the right to paid time off to
pursue approved qualifications.
The Government’s New Start Strategy,
launched in November 1997 and a key strand
of the Investing in Young People programme,
aims to tackle disaffection and re-engage
14—17 year olds in learning.
• In 1995-96, 204,000 students in the
UK obtained 2 or more passes at
GCE A level or equivalent.
• A total of 903,600 entries were made
for GCE A level/Scottish Certificate
of Education (H grade4) examinations
in Great Britain in 1995-96; 55% of
these achieved grades A-C.s There
was an almost 50% increase in the
numbers of NVQs awarded between
1993-94 and 1995-96 (from 240,000
to 354,000), and awards of GNVQs
rose more than fourfold over the same
period (from 19,000 to 84,000).
• A total of 445,800 higher education
qualifications were awarded in the
UK in 1995-96. Of these 83,800 were
sub-degree qualifications, 255,200
were first degrees, 9,800 were PhD or
equivalent and 97,100 were at
masters/other postgraduate level.
Higher Education
A large proportion of young people—about a
third in England and Wales and almost half in
Scotland—continue in education at a more
advanced level beyond the age of 18. The
higher education sector provides a variety of
4 Higher grade.
5 A levels are marked on a seven-point scale: A, B, C, D, E,

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
courses up to degree and postgraduate degree
level, and carries out research. It increasingly
caters for older students; over 50% of students
are now aged over 25 and many study part-
time. The main higher education institutions
in the UK are:
• 89 universities (one of which—the
University of London—comprises over
40 institutions) and 19 colleges and
institutes of higher education which have
the power to award their own degrees;
• 34 other colleges of higher education,
which do not have degree-awarding
powers but provide courses leading to
degrees validated by universities; and
• the Open University, which provides
part-time higher education opportunities
through open and distance learning (see
below).
Access and foundation courses provide a
preparation before enrolment on a course of
higher education for prospective students who
do not have the standard entry qualifications.
Many of these students are from the ethnic
minority communities.
Universities
Universities enjoy academic freedom, appoint
their own staff, decide which students to
admit and award their own degrees. The
universities of Oxford and Cambridge date
from the 13th century, and the Scottish
universities of St Andrews, Glasgow and
Aberdeen from the 15th century. The
University of Edinburgh was established in
the 16th century. All the other universities
were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The 1960s saw considerable expansion in new
universities. There was also a substantial
increase in 1992, when polytechnics and their
Scottish equivalents were given their own
degree-awarding powers and were allowed to
take the university title. At the same time,
similar provision was made for higher
education colleges which met certain criteria.
Applications for first degree courses are
usually made through the Universities and
Colleges Admission Service (UCAS), in
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
First degree courses are mainly full-time
and usually last three years in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. However, there are
some four-year courses, and medical and
veterinary courses normally require five years.
All traditional first degree courses in Scotland
require a minimum of three years’ study (or
four years to honours level). Universities offer
courses in a wide range of subjects, some of
which lead to the examinations of the chief
professional bodies. Many universities have
close links with commerce and industry; some
students have a job and attend on a part-time
basis.
Degree titles vary according to each
university. In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland the most common titles for a first
degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor
of Science (BSc) and for a second degree
Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science
(MSc), or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). In the
older Scottish universities Master is used for a
first degree in arts subjects. Uniformity of
standards between universities is promoted by
employing external examiners for all
university examinations.
Some universities are responsible for
validating degrees at higher education
institutions without degree-awarding powers.
The Government is encouraging
universities to co-operate closely with industry
on research. Around 55 science parks have
been set up by higher education institutions in
conjunction with industrial scientists and
technologists to promote the development and
commercial application of advanced
technology (see chapter 25, p. 428).
The Open University
The Open University, financed by the Higher
Education Funding Council for England, is a
non-residential university offering degree and
other courses for adult students of all ages.
Teaching is through a combination of
specially produced printed texts,
correspondence tuition, television and radio
broadcasts, audio/video cassettes and, for
some courses, computing and short residential
schools. There is a network of study centres
for contact with part-time tutors and
counsellors, and with fellow students.
140
EDUCATION
Students do not need formal academic
qualifications to register for most courses.
Its first degrees are the BA (Open) or the
BSc (Open), which are general degrees
awarded on a system of credits for each course
completed. There is also an MMath degree for
students who have taken an approved
combination of courses specialising in
mathematics, and an MEng degree for those
who have studied an approved combination of
courses to achieve the highest professional
status of Chartered Engineer. About 200,000
first degrees have been awarded since the
University opened in 1970.
The University has a programme of higher
degrees as well. About 20,000 students were
registered on higher degree courses in 1998.
There are also programmes for professionals
in a variety of fields.
Higher Education Funding Arrangements
Government finance for higher education
institutions in England, Scotland and Wales is
distributed by higher education funding
councils responsible to their respective
Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland grant
is paid direct to the two universities by DENI,
following advice from the Northern Ireland
Higher Education Council. The private
University of Buckingham receives no public
grants.
The funding councils and DENI help to
meet the costs of teaching, research and
related activities in all publicly funded
universities and higher education colleges. As
well as teaching students, institutions
undertake paid training, research or
consultancy for commercial firms. Many
establishments have endowments or receive
grants from foundations and benefactors.
Grants for postgraduate study are offered
by the government education departments and
by the research councils (see pp. 425-8).
Increasing numbers of scholarships are
available from research charities, endowments
and particular industries or companies.
In July 1997 the National Committee of
Inquiry into Higher Education under the
chairmanship of Lord Dearing published its
report on the future development and funding
of the sector throughout the UK. The report
supported a further expansion of up to 40% in
higher education over the next 20 years and
made 93 recommendations, the majority of
which were accepted by the Government
when it gave its formal response to the
Committee in February 1998.
Since 1989 full-time students have
increased by about 75%; however, at the same
time there has been a 25% reduction in public
funding for each student. The Teaching and
Higher Education Act, implementing new
funding and student support arrangements,
was approved by Parliament in July 1998. The
Government judged that further improvement
or expansion of higher education was
unaffordable on the basis of the previous
arrangements, and agreed with the Dearing
Committee that those who benefit from higher
education should contribute more towards its
costs. From 1998-99, most full-time students
on first degree and other comparable higher
education courses will be asked to pay up to
£1,000 (depending on their own, and their
parents’ or spouse’s, income) as a contribution
towards the costs of their tuition. The balance
will be paid from public funds, through LEAs.
From 1999 to 2000, means-tested
maintenance grants will be replaced by
maintenance loans, part of which will also be
means-tested. In 1998-99 grants will still be
available, but their value reduced to around a
quarter of the total maintenance support
available. Loans of at least £1,000 for living
costs will be available to make sure that no
student or family will have to pay more during
the course of studies than they would under
the arrangements for existing students.
Student support arrangements in Scotland
and Northern Ireland are administered by the
Student Awards Agency for Scotland and the
Northern Ireland education and library
boards.
Educational Research
Educational research is supported financially
by government departments, the Economic
and Social Research Council (see p. 427),
charities, higher education institutions,
teachers’ associations and other agencies. The
major research institutions outside the
universities are the autonomous National

Adult Education
Further education for adults is provided by
further education institutions, adult centres
and colleges run by LEAs, and voluntary
bodies such as the Workers’ Educational
Association. The duty to secure such
education is shared by the further education
funding councils, SOEID and LEAs.
University departments of continuing
education also provide courses for adults.
The councils and SOEID fund formal
academic and vocational courses, courses
providing access to higher education and
courses in basic literacy and numeracy,
including English for speakers of other
languages. LEAs are responsible for the less
142
EDUCATION
formal leisure and recreational courses. The
councils, SOEID and the LEAs must take
account of adult students with special
educational needs.
NIACE (The National Organisation for Adult
Learning)
NIACE represents all interests in the
education and training of adults in England
and Wales. It is a membership body and a
registered charity. It convenes conferences,
seminars and meetings, collects and
disseminates information, conducts inquiries
and research, undertakes special projects
and publishes a monthly journal (Adults
Learning).
Scottish Community Education Council
The Scottish Community Education Council
advises the Government and promotes the
development of community education in
Scotland, including adult literacy and basic
education, and youth work.
Basic Skills Agency
The Basic Skills Agency is concerned with
improving literacy, numeracy and related
basic skills in England and Wales. It provides
consultancy and advisory services; funds local
development projects, including research;
publishes materials for teachers and students;
and organises and sponsors staff training.
It has developed a family literacy initiative,
encouraging parents with poor literacy skills
to improve them while also helping their
children’s progress. The Government expects
to extend the initiative significantly in
1998-99.
Adult and Community Learning Lund
In February 1998 the DfEE launched a new
Adult and Community Learning Fund to give
further help for basic literacy and numeracy
skills among adults in England. In addition to
government funding, matching finance will be
sought from trusts, charities, businesses and
other donors.
Lifelong Learning
In February 1998 the DfEE issued proposals
for a new strategy to encourage the continuous
development of everybody’s skills, knowledge
and understanding, which it believes is
essential for business competitiveness,
individual employability and personal
fulfilment. Separate learning strategies for
Wales and for Scotland have also been
published. (For publication details of all the
above, see Further Reading.)
University for Industry (Ufl)
One of the Government’s main proposals is
the establishment of a University for Industry
(Ufl) as a new organisation for open and
distance learning. Due for launch in the year
2000, it will form the hub of a national
network of multimedia learning centres (run
on a franchise basis by organisations and
partnerships), using modern communication
technologies to link businesses and individuals
to cost-effective, accessible and flexible
education and training. The Ufl will:
• analyse the needs of the market and
potential customers, including skill gaps,
employment trends and resources;
• drive demand for learning through mass
marketing and promotion;
• provide people and companies with
information, advice and guidance on
learning opportunities, and connect them
with resources that match their
individual needs (whether full-time or
part-time courses, or through study at
home, at work or at a local learning
centre);
• commission new courses from education
providers to fill gaps between existing
supply and demand; and
• ensure the quality of learning products
and services which it brokers or
commissions.
In March 1998 the Government announced
plans for new ‘centres of excellence’ to boost
local skills training, especially in information
and communication technology. Forming part
of the infrastructure for the new University
143
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
for Industry, the centres will provide
innovative and flexible training to small- and
medium-sized organisations and to individuals
who do not have ready access to current
training programmes and initiatives.
Scotland will have its own Ufl, building on
the distinctive Scottish education system and
taking into account the remits of existing
organisations in Scotland.
Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs)
To encourage a culture of lifelong learning,
the Government proposes the introduction of
individual learning accounts. These will help
individuals to save and borrow for investment
in their own development. ILAs will be
available to everyone, and will be used, at the
learner’s choice, to pay for learning—whether
an evening class or a programme bought
through the Ufl.
The Government is consulting employers,
Training and Enterprise Councils, Local
Enterprise Companies and financial
institutions on developing a framework for
these accounts so as to encourage as many
people as possible to open them. In the
medium term this could be done through tax
incentives or by making a contribution from
public funds.
LINKS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
Large numbers of people from other countries
come to the UK to study, and many
British people work and train overseas. The
British aid programme (see chapter 7, p. 89)
encourages links between educational
institutions in the UK and developing
countries.
European Union Schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU’s
SOCRATES programme through
ERASMUS (the European Community
Action Scheme for the Mobility of Students)
which provides grants to enable university
students from the EU and from Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein to study in other
states. The programme covers all academic
subjects, and the period of study normally
lasts between three and 12 months.
SOCRATES also promotes competence in
foreign languages through the LINGUA
scheme. Other parts of the programme
support partnerships between schools, study
visits by senior educationalists and a range of
multinational projects including open and
distance learning, adult education and
education for the children of migrant workers,
gypsies and travellers. Around 1,430 UK
schools have taken part in transnational
SOCRATES partnerships.
The LEONARDO DA VINCI programme
supports and complements vocational training
policies and practices in EU member states
(and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein),
fostering transnational co-operation and
innovation in training through pilot projects,
exchanges and research projects.
The Youth for Europe programme supports
youth exchange projects in EU member states
and related activities such as youth leader
training. The third phase of the programme,
which began in 1995, will run to the end of 1999.
EU member states have created nine
European schools, including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire, for pupils aged between 4 and
19, to provide a multilingual education for the
children of staff employed in EU institutions.
Overseas Students in the UK
British universities and other higher and
further education establishments have built up
a strong reputation overseas by offering
tuition of the highest standards and
maintaining low student-to-staff ratios. About
230,000 overseas students are now studying in
the UK at publicly funded higher and further
education institutions.
Most overseas students following courses of
higher or further education pay fees covering
the full cost of their courses. Nationals of other
EU member states generally pay the lower level
of fees applicable to British home students.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for foreign students and trainees
through its international development
144
EDUCATION
programme and other award and scholarship
schemes. Some 4,200 overseas students from
about 150 countries currently receive awards
from scholarship schemes funded in part by
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
and the Department for International
Development (DFID). The two main schemes
funded by the FCO and DFID are:
• British Chevening awards, a worldwide
programme offering outstanding
graduate students and young
professionals the opportunity to spend
time studying at British universities and
other academic institutions; and
• the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, offering scholarships for
study in other Commonwealth countries.
Under the scheme in the UK
scholarships are for postgraduate study
or research for one to three years at
British higher education institutions.
The FCO is also increasing the number of
scholarships jointly funded with British or
foreign commercial firms, and with academic
and other institutions. There are now some
800 such scholarships.
Other Schemes
Many other public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas. Among the best known are the
British Council Fellowships, the Fulbright
Scholarship Scheme, the British Marshall
Scholarships, the Rhodes Scholarships, the
Churchill Scholarships and the Confederation
of British Industry Scholarships. The Overseas
Research Students Awards Scheme, funded by
the higher education funding councils, also
provides help for overseas full-time
postgraduate students with outstanding
research potential. Most British universities
and colleges offer bursaries and scholarships for
which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The youth service—a partnership between
local government and voluntary
organisations—is concerned with the informal
personal and social education of young people
aged 11 to 25 (5 to 25 in Northern Ireland).
Local authorities maintain their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional voluntary
organisations. In England, the service is
estimated to reach around 3 million young
people, with the voluntary organisations
contributing a significant proportion of overall
provision.
In England the DfEE supports the youth
service through grants to the National Youth
Agency, the National Council for Voluntary
Youth Services and National Voluntary Youth
Organisations. Funded primarily by local
government, the National Youth Agency
provides support for those working with
young people and for information and
publishing services.
The Welsh Office sponsors the Wales
Youth Agency, which is the agent for payment
of grant aid to national youth service bodies
with headquarters in Wales; it is also
responsible for the accreditation of training
and staff development for youth workers.
In Scotland the youth service forms part of
the community education provision made by
local authorities. It is also promoted by the
Scottish Community Education Council. The
Scottish Office gives grants to voluntary youth
organisations to help them with their
headquarters expenditure and staff training.
In Northern Ireland the education and
library boards provide and fund youth clubs
and outdoor activity centres. They assist with
the running costs of registered voluntary
youth units and provide advice and support to
youth groups. Boards also help young people
visiting the rest of Britain, Ireland and
overseas. The Youth Council for Northern
Ireland advises the education system on the
development of the youth service. It promotes
the provision of facilities, encourages cross¬
community activity and pays grants to the
headquarters of voluntary bodies.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake a significant share of youth
activities through local groups, which raise
145
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
most of their day-to-day expenses by their
own efforts. Many receive financial and other
help from local authorities, which also make
available facilities in many areas. The
voluntary organisations vary greatly in
character and include the uniformed
organisations, such as the Scouts and Girl
Guides. Some organisations are church-based.
Some also represent Jews and Muslims. In
Wales, Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh
League of Youth) provides cultural, sporting
and language-based activities for young Welsh
speakers and learners.
Thousands of youth clubs encourage their
members to take part in sport, cultural and
other creative activities. Some youth clubs
provide information, counselling and advice.
Many voluntary youth organisations and
local authorities provide services for the young
unemployed, young people from ethnic
minorities, young people in inner cities or
rural areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Many authorities have youth
committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented. They employ youth
officers to co-ordinate youth work and to
arrange in-service training.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified youth
and community workers; several
undergraduate part-time and postgraduate
courses are also available. In Scotland one-,
two- and three-year courses are provided at
teacher education institutions. Students from
Northern Ireland attend courses run in
universities and colleges in the UK and the
Irish Republic.
Other Organisations
Finance is provided by many grant-giving
foundations and trusts for activities involving
young people. The Prince’s Trust and the
Royal Jubilee Trust provide grants and
practical help to individuals and organisations;
areas of concern include urban deprivation,
unemployment, homelessness, and young
offenders. Efforts are also made to assist
ethnic minorities.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
challenges young people from the UK and
other Commonwealth countries to meet
certain standards in activities such as
community service, expeditions, social and
practical skills and physical recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to help
those in need, including elderly and disabled
people. Many schools also organise
community service work as part of the
curriculum.
The EU currently offers special funding for
young volunteers through the European
Voluntary Service programme.
Millennium Volunteers
In October 1997 the Government announced a
new programme, Millennium Volunteers, to
develop sustained volunteering among 16—24
year olds in activities of value to themselves
and the wider community. These may range
from helping with reading in schools, caring
for housebound people and hospital visiting,
to working on projects designed to improve
the environment or sporting and cultural life.

The labour market in the United Kingdom has undergone major changes, with
many more women in the workforce, increased levels of part-time working and
the continuing move towards employment in service industries, where over
three-quarters of employees now work. Unemployment has fallen since the end
of 1992, although it remains above the levels during the post-war years up to the
end of the 1970s.
The Governjnent’s policy is focusing on the need for a skilled, trained and
adaptable labour force and a flexible labour market, supported by minimum
standards of fairness and decency, and based on partnership between
employers, employees and their representatives. A national minimum wage is
to be introduced in April 1999. Government plans to improve employment
rights and industrial relations were announced in a White Paper in May 1998.
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
Some 29 million people were classed as
economically active in the UK in June-August
1998, of whom 27.2 million were in
employment: 15 million men and 12.1 million
women (see Table 11.1). Employment is
growing following a decline during the
recession of the early 1990s, and the number
in employment rose by 307,000 (1.1%) in the
year to June-August 1998.
Among the long-term trends in the labour
market:
• Part-time workers now total 6.7 million,
25% of those in employment: 5.4 million
women and 1.3 million men. About 44%
of women work part-time, compared
with 9% of men.
• The proportion of employee jobs in
service industries has more than doubled
in the last 40 years, to almost 76% (see
p. 150).
• The private sector share of employment
rose from 71% in 1981 to 81% in mid-
1997. The number of employees in the
public sector fell from a peak of over 7.4
million in 1979 to fewer than 5.1 million
in mid-1997, reflecting privatisation of a
number of major industries (see p. 434).
• There has been a gradual move away
from manual to non-manual occupations,
which are now held by just over 60% of
those in employment.
Around 1.2 million people have two or more
jobs, while 1.7 million (7.4% of employees)
148
THE LABOUR MARKET
One of the most significant long-term
trends in the labour market has been the
growth in the number of women in
employment. Women now comprise nearly
45% of all those in employment in the
UK: 47% of employees and 26% of the
self-employed. Over half of non-manual
workers are women. In most service
industries more than half of employees are
women, while in manufacturing,
construction, agriculture and the service
sub-sector of transport and
communications women account for fewer
than one-third of employees.
are engaged in temporary jobs (see Table
11.3). The main reason for people working in
temporary jobs is that they cannot find a
permanent one. However, a significant
proportion of temporary employees—37% of
women and 26% of men—prefer a temporary
job. ‘Teleworking’—people working from
home using information technology—is
becoming more widespread. In spring 1998
some 247,000 people were classed as
teleworkers whose main job was primarily in
their own home; extending the definition to
cover those working in different places using
home as a base and those who spent at least
one day a week working from home raised the
number to 1.1 million.
Around 3.2 million people are self-
employed in the UK, 79% working full-time.
Around 16% of men and 7% of women in
employment are self-employed. Agriculture
and fishing, and construction have the highest
proportions of self-employed people, while
relatively few of those engaged in
manufacturing and public administration
are self-employed.
Employment by Sector
The marked shift in jobs from manufacturing
to service industries has continued in the past
decade (see Table 11.4). In the year to June
1998 the number of employee jobs in service
industries rose by 328,000 (1.9%) to 17.6
Telecommunications is one service sector
where employment is rising. In the year to
June 1998, employment in postal services
and telecommunications was up by over 7%
to 518,000. A contributory factor is the
growth in call centres, which are run by
several companies, for example in banking,
other financial services, retailing and
transport. Call centres employ large
numbers of people to deal with customer
requests, and computer telephonists are one
of the fastest growing occupational groups
in the UK.

million. Employment in most service sectors
grew, although there has been a fall in some
sectors, such as building societies (reflecting
the conversion of several large societies to
banks—see p. 514).
In the last ten years most other sectors have
experienced lower levels of employment.
Traditional manufacturing industries, such as
steel and shipbuilding, have recorded
particularly large falls in employment. By
1998 manufacturing accounted for less than
18% of employees in employment, compared
with 42% in 1955. In June 1998 employee jobs
in the main manufacturing sectors included:
• 708,000 jobs in non-metallic mineral
products, metal and metal products;
• 509,000 in electrical and optical
equipment;
• 473,000 in paper, pulp, printing,
publishing and recording media;
• 452,000 in food products, beverages and
tobacco; and
• 365,000 in clothing, textiles, leather and
leather products.
Unemployment
Unemployment in the UK has fallen
considerably since the peak at the end of 1992.
In June-August 1998, 1.82 million people
were unemployed, 6.3% of those in the labour
market, compared with 8.1% in the same
period of 1996, according to the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of
unemployment as measured by the Labour
Force Survey (LFS). Unemployment was just
below the average for member states of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), and lower than in
many other European countries, but remains
above the levels during the post-war years up
to the end of the 1970s. At the regional level
within the UK, unemployment ranged from
4.6% in the South East and Eastern regions to
11.9% in Merseyside.
Some 539,000 people had been
unemployed for more than a year, of whom
339,000 had been out of work for over two
years. The unemployment rate for those aged
18-24 was 11.9%, almost double the overall
rate of unemployment. In total, the LFS
identified around 7.6 million people between
16 and 59 (for women) or 64 (for men) who
were classed as economically inactive, of
whom almost 2.4 million indicated that they
would like a job.
LABOUR MARKET POLICY
Key aspects of the Government’s labour
market policies include promoting job creation
and helping people to overcome the barriers
preventing them moving from welfare into
work. Among the issues which it is tackling
are:
• improving the employability of
unemployed people;
• removing the barriers in the tax and
benefits system which act as a
disincentive for people to move from
welfare into work (see p. 394 and
chapter 12);
• providing minimum legal standards at
work, such as on individual employment
rights; and
• tackling the social exclusion brought
about by long-term unemployment (see
chapter 9).
Government policies include the Welfare-to-
Work programme (see pp. 155-6), education
and training programmes, a national minimum
wage (see p. 157) and its employability
initiative.
Employability Initiative and Other
International Aspects
‘Employability’ was an important theme when
the UK held the presidency of the European
Union (EU) in the first half of 1998 (see
p. 76) and was also the focus of a special
conference of the G8 (group of leading
industrialised countries, plus Russia—see
p. 73) in the UK in February 1998. ‘Action
Plans’ have been adopted by both the EU and
the G8, outlining how the participants are
planning to generate new job opportunities
and tackle unemployment.
The UK’s employability initiative is
intended to promote job creation and social
151
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
cohesion. It focuses on the need for a skilled,
trained and adaptable labour force and flexible
labour market, supported by minimum
standards of fairness and decency, including
the national minimum wage.
The Government has announced that the
UK will now play a full part in the direction of
social affairs in Europe, and it has ended the
UK’s opt-out from the EU Agreement on
Social Policy (the social chapter—see p. 79).
European Community (EC) directives
implemented or in the process of being
implemented in the UK include those on
working time (see p. 158), works councils (see
p.158), part-time work, young workers and
parental leave (see p. 160).
TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
ENTERPRISE
Education and training are among the
Government’s top priorities, and are
considered essential for ensuring that the UK
workforce has the necessary skills to meet the
requirements of the rapidly changing world
economy.
According to the Labour Force Survey in
spring 1998, 3.3 million employees of working
age in the UK had received job-related training
in the previous four weeks, 14.6% of such
employees. Training is highest among young
workers, especially those between 16 and 24.
Investing in Young People
Investing in Young People is the
Government’s strategy to improve
participation and attainment of those aged
16-19, including measures affecting schools,
colleges and work-based training, as well as a
new focus for the Careers Service. As part of
this strategy, the Government plans to ensure
that all young people have access to high-
quality education and training irrespective of
whether they opt to take up education in a
school sixth form or further education college
or work-based training through an
apprenticeship, traineeship or other
arrangement. In addition, under the Welfare-
to-Work programme, all young unemployed
people are guaranteed education and training
opportunities, while those with poor basic
Skill shortages have become evident in a
number of sectors including information
technology (IT). In June 1998 the
Government announced that 120 new
Centres of Excellence for IT and High
Technology and Skills Challenge facilities
would be set up in colleges, TECs (see p.
153), universities and employer premises,
offering around 50,000 new opportunities
for people and businesses to update and
improve their skills. A Skills Task Force
has been set up to identify skill needs and
shortages, and to propose measures to
tackle the problem. The Welfare-to-Work
programme (see p. 155) is also helping to
deal with this issue. For example, the
hospitality industry is setting up a network
of New Deal training centres, aimed at
providing places for 40,000 young people
to meet skill shortages in the hotels and
catering, and tourism sectors.
skills have the option of participating in full¬
time study on an approved course.
The objectives of the two main work-based
training programmes—National Traineeships
and Modern Apprenticeships—are to:
• provide participants with training leading
to vocational qualifications at National
Vocational Qualification/Scottish
Vocational Qualification (NVQ/SVQ)
levels 2 and 3 or above and with the
broad-based skills necessary to become
flexible and self-reliant employees; and
• meet the skill needs of the national and
local economies.
National Traineeships, introduced in 1997,
are an important part of the Investing in
Young People strategy. They offer broad and
flexible learning programmes, including the
key skills of communication, numeracy and
information technology, and operate to agreed
national standards set by industry and
employers in 40 industry sectors.
Modern Apprenticeships are designed to
increase significantly the number of young
people trained to technician, supervisory and
equivalent levels. Over 210,000 young people
have begun Modern Apprenticeships, which
152
THE LABOUR MARKET
are in operation in 80 industry sectors.
Evaluation studies have found that Modern
Apprenticeships are of high quality, are very
popular and have met the expectations of both
employers and young people.
In Scotland the government-funded
training programme for young people is
Skillseekers; all young people aged 16 and 17
are entitled to Skillseekers training. Its key
elements are training leading to a recognised
qualification, up to SVQ_level 3; an individual
training plan; and employer involvement.
There are separate training arrangements for
young people in Wales.
Other Training Programmes
Outside Modern Apprenticeships and
National Traineeships, a variety of other
training programmes and help for training are
available. For example, the Improving the
Training Market programme covers a range of
activities funded by the Department for
Education and Employment (DfEE) aimed at
encouraging investment by individuals in
lifelong learning, and at improving the quality,
impact and cost-effectiveness of vocational
education and training. Other programmes or
help include:
• Career development loans, which are
available to help people pay for vocational
education or training in Great Britain.
Loans of between £300 and £8,000 are
provided through four major banks, and
interest payments on the loans during
training and for one month after training
are funded by the DfEE. The loans help
to pay for courses lasting up to two years.
More than 95,000 people have borrowed
£298 million through the programme
since 1988 to pay for training.
• The Small Firms Training Loans
programme, which helps firms with 50 or
fewer employees to meet a range of
training-related expenses, including
training consultancy. Loans of between
£500 and £125,000 are available through
eight major banks, and repayments can
be deferred for up to 12 months.
• The National Training Awards are an
annual competition designed to promote
good training practice by example,
rewarding those who have carried out
exceptionally effective training. The
competition was revised in 1997 to
concentrate more on training by
employers. Awards are made each year to
around 100 employers, training providers
and individuals.
Work-Based Training for Adults will replace
the Training for Work programme in England
and Wales during 1998-99; the latter
programme will continue in Scotland. The
new programme will be open to those aged 25
to 63 who have been unemployed for six
months or longer. The aim will be to help the
long-term unemployed, especially those at risk
of exclusion from the job market, to find jobs
or self-employment through training and work
experience.
Training Bodies
Training and Enterprise Councils
There are 78 Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) in England and Wales.
These are independent companies with
employer-led boards. Their objective is to
foster local economic development and
stimulate employer investment in skills—in
particular through the Investors in People
standard (see p. 154)—within their area. They
have an important role in delivering training
and enterprise programmes which are funded
by the Government. Programmes managed
through TECs in England in 1998—99 will be
worth some £1,300 million.
Local Enterprise Companies
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland. These
have wider-ranging responsibilities than the
TECs, covering both economic development
and environmental improvement. LECs are
also responsible for the delivery of the
Government’s national training programmes
in Scotland but, unlike TECs, have no
responsibility for work-related further
education. They run under contract to two
non-departmental public bodies: Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise (see p. 442).

National Training Organisations
A new network of National Training
Organisations (NTOs) was introduced in 1997
to streamline the network of industry training
organisations, ‘lead bodies’ and occupational
standards councils. The NTOs act as a focal
point for education and training matters in
their particular sector, and provide an
important link with the education sector.
Their role is to ensure that the skills needs of
their sectors are being met and that
occupational standards are being established
and maintained for key occupations. They
have worked closely with TECs and LECs in
developing the frameworks of Modern
Apprenticeships and National Traineeships.
By October 1998, there were 61 NTOs,
covering 83% of the workforce.
Targets and Standards
The National Targets for Education and
Training (see also chapter 10), launched by
the Confederation of British Industry in 1991,
are supported by the Government and many
national and local organisations, including all
NTOs, TECs and LECs. The Targets aim to
improve the UK’s international
competitiveness by raising standards and
attainment levels in education and training.
The Investors in People standard provides
a framework for employers to support their
investment in education and training. It helps
companies to improve their performance by
linking the training and development of all
employees directly to the achievement of
business objectives. By August 1998 nearly
11,000 organisations had achieved recognition
as Investors in People, with a further 21,000
committed to achieving the standard. Over 7.7
million employees work in organisations
involved in Investors in People, 34% of UK
employees. Reported benefits include
increased productivity, higher profits, lower
rates of sickness and absenteeism, and
improved morale. The Government is
committed to making Investors in People the
general standard across all UK employers. It is
looking particularly to see many more small
businesses work towards the standard, and
aims to remove barriers to learning by making
Investors in People more accessible to small
organisations.
A new Training Standards Council has
been established to supervise a Training
Inspectorate to raise standards of training
funded through TECs.
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development, aims to assist
economic development and help people find
work through training and employment
services. It has encouraged the formation of a
sector training council in each main sector to
advise on employers’ training needs and
develop sectoral training strategies. In
addition, the Agency supports company
training through its Company Development
Programme and encourages management
development by providing training
programmes and seminars.
In April 1998 the Agency launched the
New Deal initiative under the Welfare-to-
Work programme (see p. 155). Northern
Ireland has its own range of training and
employment programmes for people seeking
work. Its Jobskills programme is designed to
raise skill levels—and is linked to the
attainment of NVQs—and to enhance the
employment prospects of school-leavers and
unemployed adults. About 14,000 places are
available in 1998-99. To combat the relatively
high level of long-term unemployment in
Northern Ireland, the Agency is spending
£22.2 million in 1998-99 on its Action for
Community Employment Scheme and £5.7
million on Enterprise Ulster (a statutory
organisation which provides employment,
training and work experience).
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
There are a variety of ways in which people find
jobs. According to the Labour Force Survey in
summer 1998, the main methods were:
• replying to advertisements and studying
situations vacant columns in newspapers
and journals (41%);
154
THE LABOUR MARKET
• visiting a Jobcentre or being on the books
of an employment agency (30%);
• direct approaches to employers (12%);
• asking friends, relatives, colleagues or
trade unions (9%).
Welfare-to-Work
The Government’s Welfare-to-Work
programme is a series of measures designed to
tackle youth and long-term unemployment,
promote employability and develop skills, and
move people from welfare into jobs. The
programme is being funded by a windfall tax
on the excess profits of the privatised utilities
(see p. 396). Some £5,200 million is being
invested in the programme, in a number of
‘New Deals’ including:
• £2,590 million for young unemployed
people;
• £480 million for the long-term
unemployed;
• £190 million for lone parents;
• £210 million for disabled people;
• £60 million for partners of the
unemployed;
• £40 million for childcare; and
• £1,300 million for schools.
Young Unemployed
Initially introduced in January 1998 in 12
‘pathfinder’ areas, the New Deal for the young
unemployed was extended throughout the UK
in April 1998. It is available to young people
aged 18-24 who have been unemployed for
more than six months, through four options:
• a job attracting a wage subsidy of £60 a
week, payable to employers for up to six
months;
• a work placement with a voluntary
organisation;
• a six-month work placement with an
Environmental Task Force; and
• for those without basic qualifications, a
place on a full-time education and
training course, which might last for up
to one year.
All the options include an element of training.
For each young person the programme begins
with a ‘Gateway’ period of careers advice and
intensive help with looking for work, and with
training in the skills needed for the world of
work. By October 1998, over 160,000 young
people had joined the programme, of whom
more than 30,000 had moved into jobs. Over
29,000 employers are participating in the
employer option.
Long-term Unemployed
Under the New Deal for the long-term
unemployed, which started in June 1998,
employers receive a subsidy of £75 a week for
six months if they employ anyone who has
been unemployed for two years or longer.
From November 1998 a series of pilot
schemes will offer 90,000 opportunities for the
long-term unemployed aged 25 and over, with
similar arrangements to the New Deal for the
young unemployed, including a ‘Gateway’
period of intensive help with looking for, and
preparing for, work. Some 30,000 of these new
opportunities will be available in Northern
Ireland, covering all those who have been
unemployed for over 18 months.
Prototype Employment Zones were
launched in February 1998 in five areas of
high unemployment: Glasgow, Liverpool,
north-west Wales, Plymouth and south
Teesside. New approaches to tackling
unemployment will take place in these
areas and will be delivered by local
partnerships of public, private and
voluntary sector organisations. About
£33 million is available to support this
initiative, which aims to help around 5,000
long-term unemployed jobseekers aged 25
and over.
Other Groups
The New Deal for Lone Parents provides job
search help, advice and training for lone
parents whose youngest child is aged over five.
It was extended to all lone parents on income
support from October 1998. Pilot schemes to
155
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
help those who are disabled or on incapacity
benefit who want training or work have also
started. In the March 1998 Budget a New
Deal for partners of the unemployed was
announced, so that they too will have the
option of help needed to return to work.
Government Employment Services
The Government provides a range of services
to jobseekers through the Employment
Service, an executive agency of the DfEE.
These include:
• a network of local offices, at which people
can find details of job opportunities;
• advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into
employment, for example, by training;
and
• a range of special programmes.
The Employment Service has about 1,020
Jobcentres and a budget of £1,770 million for
1998-99, of which £727 million is connected
with the New Deals. In 1997—98 it placed
nearly 1.4 million unemployed people into
jobs and conducted some 7.5 million advisory
interviews to help people find appropriate
work or places on employment and training
programmes.
Advisory Services
Through the main Jobcentre services,
unemployed people have access to vacancies,
employment advice and training
opportunities. Employment Service advisers
see all jobseekers when a claim is made for
Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 177) to assess
their eligibility and to provide advice about
jobs, training and self-employment
opportunities. To receive the allowance, each
unemployed person has to complete a
Jobseeker’s Agreement, which includes details
of availability for work and the steps that he or
she has agreed to take to find work.
Unemployed people are required to attend an
interview every six months, when an adviser
reviews with the jobseeker his or her situation
and, if appropriate, revises the Jobseeker’s
Agreement.
With the introduction of the New Deal
programmes for the young and long-term
unemployed, the range of existing
Employment Service programmes will be
restructured and brought together into a new
package of measures; as a result, some
programmes have been withdrawn. Among
those still in operation in 1998-99 are:
• Jobplan workshops, which provide
guidance and other support to enable
those unemployed for a year to assess
their skills, qualities and training needs,
and to act as an introduction to future job
and training options; and
• Work Trials, which enable jobseekers
who have been unemployed for over six
months to try out jobs for a maximum of
three weeks.
Help for People with Disabilities
Most disabled people assisted by the
Employment Service are helped through its
mainstream services, and have priority access
to the main programmes for unemployed
people. Services for people with disabilities
who need more specialist help to get or keep a
job are available through Disability
Employment Advisers based in Jobcentres.
The advisers are members of local integrated
specialist teams—Placing Assessment and
Counselling Teams.
These services include:
• the Access to Work programme, which
helps people with disabilities to overcome
barriers to employment; and
• the Supported Employment Programme,
which supports jobs for over 22,000
people with severe disabilities. The
programme helps people who are capable
of worthwhile employment, but cannot
obtain or retain jobs in open competition
because of the severity of their disability,
or who have a limited productivity.
Employment Agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with many
branches. The total value of the market has
156
THE LABOUR MARKET
been estimated at about £13,200 million a
year.
The law governing employment agencies is
less restrictive than in many other EU
countries, but agencies must comply with
legislation which establishes a framework of
minimum standards designed to protect
agency users, both workers and hirers. A
review of the regulatory framework is planned,
and the Department of Trade and Industry
will be issuing a consultative document later
in 1998.
PAY AND CONDITIONS
Earnings
Average gross weekly earnings of full-time
employees on adult rates in Great Britain
whose pay was unaffected by absence were
£384 in April 1998, according to the ONS
New Earnings Survey. Average earnings for
men were £427 and for women £310.
Earnings were higher for non-manual
employees (£425) than for manual employees
(£307), with managerial and professional
groups the highest paid. The sectors with the
highest average weekly earnings are financial
intermediation (£510) and mining and
quarrying (£506), while the sectors with the
lowest earnings are hotels and restaurants, and
agriculture, hunting and forestry.
Overtime and other additional payments
are particularly important for manual
employees, representing over one-fifth of their
earnings. About 49% of manual employees
and 17% of non-manual employees received
overtime payments.
Minimum Wage
The Government is introducing a statutory
national minimum wage, which is designed to
remove the worst excesses of exploitation of
low-paid workers and ensure greater fairness
in the workplace. The National Minimum
Wage Act 1998 sets out the framework under
which it will be applied.
An independent Low Pay Commission has
examined wage levels and advised the
Government on the level at which the national
minimum wage might be introduced. The
Government accepted its recommendations,
subject to some modifications, including
phasing in the rate for young people. The
national minimum wage will be introduced in
April 1999, at:
• £3.60 an hour for those over 21;
• a development rate of £3.00 an hour for
workers aged 18-21, which will rise to
£3.20 an hour for those aged 18-20 in
June 2000, while the Commission will be
looking again in 1999 at the position for
those aged 21 and whether they should
be covered by the main rate; and
• a development rate of £3.20 an hour for
workers over 21 for the first six months
in a new job with a new employer,
subject to the workers receiving
accredited training.
All those aged 16 and 17 and those on
apprenticeships will be exempt. Nearly 2
million people are expected to benefit from
the national minimum wage, including 1.3
million women and over 1.2 million part-time
workers. Among those who will benefit are
young people, homeworkers, lone parents who
work, and ethnic minority workers. Sectors
likely to be most affected are hospitality
(hotels and catering), retailing, cleaning,
hairdressing, social care, footwear and
clothing, and private security.
Fringe Benefits
Fringe benefits are used by many employers to
provide additional rewards to their employees.
They include schemes to encourage financial
participation by employees in their companies,
pension schemes, private medical insurance,
subsidised meals, company cars and childcare
schemes. About 11 million people in Britain
are members of occupational pension schemes
provided by their employers.
Company cars are provided for employees
in a wide variety of circumstances. Around
1.65 million people have a company car
available for private use and about half of
these receive fuel for private motoring in
their car.
By the end of March 1998, some 14,300
profit-related pay schemes, which link part of
157
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
pay to changes in a business’s profits, were
registered with the Inland Revenue, covering
around 4.6 million people. Many companies
have adopted employee share schemes, where
employees receive free shares or options to
buy shares at a discount from their employer
without paying income tax.
Hours of Work
Most full-time employees have a basic
working week of between 34 and 40 hours, and
work a five-day week. When overtime is taken
into account, average weekly hours worked by
full-time workers in their main job in the UK
in June-August 1998 were 38.6 hours: 40.6 for
men and 34.7 for women. For part-time
workers the average was 15.3 hours. More
men than women work overtime, and those in
manual occupations generally work more
overtime than employees in non-manual jobs.
Both male and female full-time employees
tend to work more hours than in other EU
countries. Hours worked tend to be longest in
agriculture, construction, and transport and
communications, and shortest in most service
industries.
Flexible working hours were worked by
14% of female and 9% of male full-time
employees in the UK in spring 1998. Shift
working has been growing, with 17% of full¬
time employees in spring 1998 on some form
of shift work, notably in the personal and
protective occupations (47%) and among plant
and machine operatives (36%).
Holiday entitlements have generally been
determined by negotiation. In autumn 1997
the average paid holiday entitlement for full¬
time workers was just under five weeks.
However, some employees, such as part-time
and temporary employees, may have much
less holiday entitlement.
Two EC directives, on working time and
on young workers (in relation to hours of work
of adolescents), came into force in the UK in
October 1998. They apply to full-time, part-
time and temporary employees, although
workers in certain sectors—including
transport, sea fishing, other work at sea, and
doctors in training—are exempt. Provisions
include:
• a maximum working week of 48 hours
(on average), although individual workers
can choose to work longer;
• a minimum of three weeks’ annual paid
leave, rising to four weeks in 1999;
• minimum daily and weekly rest periods;
and
• a limit for night workers of an average
eight hours’ work in a 24-hour period.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Some 8.1 million employees (36%) in Great
Britain in 1997 were in workplaces covered by
collective bargaining, which is generally more
prevalent in large establishments and in the
public sector. Collective bargaining mainly
concerns pay and working conditions. In
general, negotiations are now being conducted
more at a local level, although many large firms
retain a degree of central control over the
bargaining process. There are relatively few
industry-wide agreements—where they do
exist, they are often supplemented by local
agreements in companies or factories (plant
bargaining).
The Government believes that the best
companies recognise their employees as partners
in the enterprise. Employers use a variety of
methods of involving their employees in the
running of the organisations in which they
work. These methods include employee
bulletins and reports, quality circles, suggestion
schemes and attitude surveys as well as works
councils and other forms of information and
consultation mechanisms. The EC’s European
Works Councils Directive, which requires firms
with 1,000 or more employees and which
operate in two or more member states to
establish European-level information and
consultation procedures, will be incorporated
into UK legislation by December 1999.
In May 1998 the Government published a
White Paper, Fairness at Work, which includes a
series of measures designed to improve
individual and collective rights.
Individual Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For

THE LABOUR MARKE T
The first findings of the 1998 Workplace
Employee Relations Survey, the largest of
its kind in the world, were published in
October 1998. The Survey is sponsored by
the DTI, ACAS, the Economic and Social
Research Council and the Policy Studies
Institute. Among its initial key findings are:
• workplace flexibility has increased,
with many more workplaces reporting
greater use of contracting out,
temporary agency workers, fixed-
term employees and part-time
workers;
• many employers have practices
designed to encourage employee
commitment and promote high
performance—for example, over half
of workplaces operated five or more
of 16 commonly discussed practices,
with teamworking, team briefings and
performance appraisals used in over
half of workplaces;
• fewer workplaces are recognising
trade unions—45%, compared with
53% in 1990;
• over half of employees expressed
themselves as satisfied (47%) or very
satisfied (7%) with their job—only
19% being dissatisfied (the remaining
27% were neither satisfied nor
dissatisfied); and
• harmonious employment relations
were widespread, with industrial
action being reported in just 2% of
workplaces.
example, most employees have a right to a
written statement setting out details of the
main conditions, including pay, hours of work
and holidays. Employees with at least two
years of continuous employment with their
employer are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist, and their employers cannot offer
suitable alternative work.1
Minimum periods of notice are laid down
for both employers and employees. Most
employees who believe they have been
unfairly dismissed have the right to complain
to an employment tribunal (see p. 161),
subject to the general qualifying period, which
is currently two years’ continuous service but
may be reduced to one year—see below. If the
complaint is upheld, the tribunal may make an
order for re-employment or, more commonly,
award compensation.
Legislation prohibits discrimination on
grounds of sex or marital status (see p. 117) or
on grounds of colour, race, nationality
(including citizenship) or ethnic or national
origin (see p. 113), in employment, training
and related matters. In Northern Ireland
discrimination in employment on grounds of
religious belief or political opinion is unlawful.
The Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984,
makes it generally unlawful to discriminate
between men and women in pay and other
terms and conditions of employment.
Under the Disability Discrimination Act
1995, disabled people have the right not to be
discriminated against in employment.
Employers with 20 or more employees have a
duty not to discriminate against disabled
employees or applicants.
All pregnant employees have the right to
statutory maternity leave with their non-wage
contractual benefits maintained, and
protection against dismissal because of
pregnancy.
Proposed New Rights
A number of proposed improvements in
employment rights for individuals were set
out in the 1998 White Paper, including:
• reducing the qualifying period from two
years to one year before employees have
protection against unfair dismissal;
• extending minimum maternity leave
from 14 weeks to 18 weeks;
• new rights on parental leave, with three
months’ leave for both women and men,
1 The statutory redundancy payment is calculated
according to a formula based on a person’s age, the
number of years of continuous service and his or her
weekly pay. However, many employers pay more than the
statutory amount.
159
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Legislation forbids any employment in the
UK of children under 13 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking
of children who have not reached the
statutory minimum school-leaving age,
with some exceptions for family
undertakings. Under new rules which took
effect in 1998, limits on working hours
were clarified, and children are now
required to have a period free from work
during school holidays. A review of the
legislation on child employment is
expected to be completed by the end of
1998. The Government has announced the
UK’s intention of ratifying an existing
International Labour Organisation (ILO)
convention on the minimum age for
admission to employment, and its support
for a new, tougher ILO convention on
child employment.
together with protection from dismissal
for exercising this right—thereby
implementing the EC’s directive on
parental leave, by December 1999; and
• a new right to take reasonable time off
from work to deal with a family
emergency.
Collective Requirements
The Government intends to retain the
industrial relations framework established by
the previous Government. However, the 1998
White Paper includes a number of planned
changes, in line with its programme of
promoting partnership between employers
and employees.
Existing Framework
Among the legal requirements governing
industrial relations:
• All individuals have the right not to be
dismissed or refused employment (or the
services of an employment agency)
because of membership or non¬
membership of a trade union.
• Trade union employees have the right
not to have union membership
subscriptions deducted from their pay
without their authorisation.
• A trade union must elect every member
of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections
must be held at least every five years and
be carried out by a secret postal ballot
under independent scrutiny.
• If a trade union wishes to set up a
political fund, its members must first
agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an
aim of the union. The union must also
ballot its members every ten years to
maintain the fund. Union members have
a statutory right to opt out of
contributing to the fund.
For a union to have the benefit of
statutory immunity when organising
industrial action, the action must be
wholly or mainly in contemplation or
furtherance of a trade dispute between
workers and their own employer.
Industrial action must not involve
workers who have no dispute with their
own employer (so-called ‘secondary’
action) or involve unlawful forms of
picketing. Before calling for industrial
action, a trade union must obtain the
support of its members in a secret postal
ballot.
Proposed Changes
The White Paper announced proposals for
legislation governing recognition by employers
of trade unions. The procedures, which apply
to firms with over 20 employees, would
encourage the parties to reach voluntary
agreement where possible, but if this proved
impossible a strengthened Central Arbitration
Committee (CAC) would decide on the issues
concerned. In particular, the CAC would be
able to determine the recognition of a union
where a ballot of the workers had shown that a
majority of those voting and at least 40% of
those eligible to vote were in favour of
recognition. However, where over half the
workforce were already union members,
160
THE LABOUR MARKET
recognition would be automatic, without the
need for a ballot.
Other proposals include:
• a right for employees dismissed for taking
part in lawfully organised official
industrial action to complain of unfair
dismissal to a tribunal;
• a new legal right for employees to be
accompanied by a fellow employee or
trade union representative during
disciplinary and grievance procedures;
• new arrangements on the provision of
information and consultation when
redundancies are planned and on the
protection of employment when a
business is transferred, for example
through a merger or acquisition; and
• making funds available to contribute to
the training of managers and employee
representatives in order to assist and
develop partnerships at work.
Employment Tribunals
Employment tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints on a range of
employment rights, including unfair dismissal,
redundancy pay, equal pay, and sex and race
discrimination. They were formerly known as
industrial tribunals, but were renamed in
August 1998 to better reflect their new role.
This change took effect under the
Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act
1998, which streamlines tribunal procedures
and encourages voluntary settlement of
disputes on employment rights. The Act also
promotes a new voluntary arbitration scheme,
developed by ACAS (see p. 163), to settle
unfair dismissal claims, and this is planned to
be introduced in spring 1999. Industrial
tribunals received 80,000 applications in
1997-98. Northern Ireland has a separate
tribunal system.
Industrial Disputes
In the past 20 years there has been a
substantial decline in working days lost
through industrial disputes (see chart on
p. 162). In 1997, there were 216 stoppages of
work arising from industrial disputes,
resulting in the loss of 235,000 working days,
the fewest working days lost in a year since
records began in 1891. Stoppages over pay
accounted for 55% of working days lost. Over
the period 1987-96 the UK’s average working
days lost per 1,000 employees in industries
and services totalled 78, which was below the
OECD average (105) and less than half the EU
average (167).
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. They are widely recognised by
employers in the public sector and in large
firms and establishments—44 of the UK’s 50
largest companies recognise unions. As well as
negotiating pay and other terms and
conditions of employment with employers,
they provide benefits and services such as
educational facilities, financial services, legal
advice and aid in work-related cases. In recent
years many unions have extended their range
of services for members.
In 1997 there were 7.1 million trade union
members in Great Britain, according to the
Labour Force Survey, 21% fewer than in
1989.2 During this period the proportion of
employees who were union members fell from
39% to 30%. The decline in membership was
particularly noticeable where it has
traditionally been high—among male
employees, manual workers and those in
production industries. Union membership is
now at a similar level among manual and non-
manual employees, having fallen much less in
the latter group. It is now only slightly higher
for men (32%) than for women (28%).
Rail transport has the highest proportion of
union members, around 80% of employees.
Among female workers, public administration

provided by trade unions to the Certification Office.
Differences in coverage result in different estimates—for
example, the Certification Office’s figure for trade union
membership at the end of 1996 was 7.9 million, compared
with 7.2 million obtained from the Labour Force Survey in
autumn 1996.

relatively few union members include
agriculture, forestry and fishing, hotels and
restaurants, and wholesaling.
Unison, which operates in the public sector
and has about 1.4 million members, is the
biggest union in Britain. Three other unions
have over 500,000 members:
• the Transport and General Workers
Union (with 885,000 members);
• the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union (725,000); and
• GMB(718,000)—a general union with
members in a range of public and private
sector industries.
At the end of 1997 there were 233 trade
unions on the list maintained by the
Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must show
that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and
employers or between workers and employers’
associations. A further 22 unions were known
to the Certification Officer.
The national body of the trade union
movement is the Trades Union Congress
(TUC), founded in 1868. Its affiliated
membership comprises 75 trade unions, which
together represent some 6.6 million people.
The TUC’s objectives are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions of
working people. It deals with all general
questions concerning trade unions, and
provides a forum in which affiliated unions can
collectively determine policy. There are six
TUC regional councils for England and a
Wales Trades Union Council. The annual
Congress meets in September to discuss
matters of concern to trade unionists. A
General Council represents the TUC between
annual meetings.
The TUC plays an active part in
international trade union activity, through its
162
THE LABOUR MARKET
affiliation to the International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions and the European
Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates
the British workers’ delegation to the annual
International Labour Conference.
In Scotland there is a separate national
central body, the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, to which UK unions usually
affiliate their Scottish branches. Nearly all
trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland
Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU). Most trade unionists in
Northern Ireland are members of unions
affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority also
belong to unions based in Great Britain, which
are affiliated to the TUC.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in the UK are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also trade associations
concerned with commercial matters in
general. With the move away from national
pay bargaining, many employers’ associations
are tending to concentrate on areas such as
supplying information for bargaining purposes
and dealing with specialist issues. As with
some of the larger trade unions, a number of
employers’ associations are increasingly
concerned with legislation and other issues
relating to Europe.
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely local
in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small
businesses; most are national and are
concerned with the whole of an industry. In
some of the main industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national
federations. At the end of 1997, 107 listed
employers’ associations were known to the
Certification Officer; a similar number of
unlisted associations were in operation.
Most national organisations belong to the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI—see
p. 433), which represents directly or indirectly
some 250,000 businesses.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body with a general duty of promoting the
improvement of industrial relations. ACAS
aims to operate through the voluntary co¬
operation of employers, employees and, where
appropriate, their representatives. Its main
functions are collective conciliation, provision
of arbitration and mediation facilities, advisory
mediation services for preventing disputes and
improving industrial relations through the
joint involvement of employers and
employees, and the provision of a public
enquiry service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual employment rights, and
is developing a new voluntary system for
resolving unfair dismissal claims (see p. 161).
In 1997 ACAS:
• received nearly 1,300 requests for
collective conciliation, of which 51%
related to pay or other terms and
conditions of employment, and handled
71 arbitration cases;
• received 106,900 individual conciliation
cases, 6% more than in 1996; and
• answered over 442,000 calls on
employment-related matters through its
public enquiry points.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
There has been a long-term decline in injuries
to employees in the UK, reflecting
improvements in safety, together with a
change in industrial structure away from the
traditional heavy industries, which tend to
have higher risks. In 1997-98, the number of
deaths for employees and the self-employed
from accidents at work is estimated at 268,
which represents a fatal accident rate of 1 per
100,000 workers. About 7 million working
days a year are lost as a result of work-related
injuries.
163
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes
general duties on everyone concerned with
work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC)
provides information and guidance on health
and safety at work in Great Britain, defines
standards and proposes legislation, and
sponsors research.
It has advisory committees covering subjects
such as toxic substances, genetic modification
and the safety of nuclear installations. There are
also several industry advisory committees, each
covering a specific sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)
advises and assists the HSC by carrying out
the latter’s policies. It also has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, investigating accidents, taking
prosecuting action, and licensing and
approving standards in areas of significant
hazard. Its field services and inspections are
carried out by the Field Operations
Directorate, which includes the Factory,
Agricultural and Quarries inspectorates and
the regional staff of the Employment Medical
Advisory Service. In 1997—98, the HSE
carried out more than 186,000 ‘regulatory
contacts’.
The HSE’s Directorate of Science and
Technology provides technical advice on
industrial health and safety matters. The
Health and Safety Laboratory supplies
scientific and forensic services, and carries out
research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health and
safety legislation is enforced by inspectors
appointed by local authorities, working under
guidance from the HSC.
Northern Ireland
The general requirements of the Northern
Ireland health and safety legislation are
broadly similar to those for Great Britain.
They are enforced mainly by the Department
of Economic Development and the
Department of Agriculture through their
health and safety inspectorates, although the
district councils have an enforcement role
similar to that of local authorities in Great
Britain. There is a Health and Safety Agency,
roughly corresponding to the HSC but
without its policy-making powers, and an
Employment Medical Advisory Service.

Local authority personal social services and voluntary organisations provide
help and advice to the most vulnerable members of the community—elderly,
physically disabled and mentally ill people, those with learning disabilities,
and children in need of care. A White Paper on further improving the
regulation of the social services and new strategies on mental health and on
national childcare management are to be published in late 1998. A Royal
Commission on the funding of long-term care for elderly people is expected to
report by the end of the same year.
The Government is undertaking a far-reaching overhaul of the social
security system. This is based on the key objectives of promoting incentives to
work, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and strengthening community
and family life. A consultation paper outlining the principles on which reform
will be based was published in March 1998. A wide-ranging review of pensions
is in progress.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services help elderly people,
disabled people, children and young people,
people with mental illness or learning disabilities,
their families and carers. Major services include
skilled residential and day care, help for people
confined to their homes, and the various forms of
social work. Personal social services are
administered by local authorities but central
government is responsible for establishing
national policies, issuing guidance and overseeing
standards. Joint finance and planning between
health and local authorities aims to prevent
overlapping of services and to encourage the
development of community services.
The statutory services are provided by local
government social services authorities in
England and Wales, social work departments
in Scotland, and health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland. Alongside these
providers are the many and varied
contributions made by independent private
and voluntary services.
Much of the care given to elderly and
disabled people is provided by families and
self-help groups. One in eight adults gives
informal care and one in six homes has a carer.
There are about 6 million informal carers in
Great Britain, and over 60% of carers
devoting at least 20 hours of care a week are
women. Carers who provide (or intend to
165
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
provide) substantial care on a regular basis
have the right, on request, to an assessment of
their own needs. A Government-wide review
of measures to help carers as part of a national
strategy for carers is in progress. The strategy
is expected to be published for consultation in
early 1999.
Demand for personal social services is
rising because of the increasing number of
elderly people, who, along with disabled and
mentally ill people, and those with learning
disabilities, have the opportunity to lead more
normal lives in the community, if they are
given suitable support and facilities.
In 1995, in response to the piecemeal way
regulation in social services had developed, the
previous Government launched a review of
the regulation and inspection of children’s and
adults’ personal social services. The resulting
report—the Burgner Report (1996)—
recommended that:
• local authority responsibility for
inspecting care homes should be removed
from the social services departments and
placed elsewhere;
• local authority provision should be
subject to the same registration and
enforcement rules as voluntary and
private sector provision;
• regulation should be extended to include
small children’s homes and domiciliary
care; and
• all inspection reports should be available
to the public.
Following on from these recommendations,
the Government intends to publish a White
Paper in late 1998 with proposals for further
improving the regulation of the social services.
Management Reforms
Reforms in community care provision, which
came into force between 1991 and 1993,
established a new financial and managerial
framework intended to enable vulnerable groups
in the community to live as independently as
possible in their own homes for as long as they
are able and wish to do so, and to give them a
greater say in how they live and how the services
they need should be provided.
Local authorities increasingly act as
enablers and commissioners of services, as
well as the actual providers, after assessing
their populations’ needs for social care. They
are now responsible for funding and arranging
social care in the community for people who
require public support. This includes the
provision of home helps or home care
assistants to support people in their own
homes, and making arrangements for
residential and nursing home care for those no
longer able to remain in their own homes.
Since 1997 local authorities have been able
to give cash payments to people for the
community care services they have been
assessed as needing, rather than arranging
those services for them.
Elderly People
Older people represent the fastest growing
section of the community. The proportion of
the population aged 75 and over rose from 5%
in 1971 to 7% in 1996. The number of elderly
people in the population is expected to grow
less quickly in the next decade than it has in
the previous decade.
Services for elderly people are designed to
help them live at home whenever possible.
These services may include advice and help
given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services, as well
as day centres, lunch clubs and recreational
facilities. Adaptations to the home can

SOCIAL PROTECTION
overcome a person’s difficulties in moving
about, and a range of equipment is available
for people with poor hearing or eyesight.
Alarm systems help elderly people obtain
assistance in an emergency. In some areas
‘good neighbour’ and visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Elderly people who live in
residential care homes or nursing homes are
subject to means-test charging. Those who
cannot afford to pay have their costs met by
the State. Local authorities in England,
Scotland and Wales may also levy charges for
domiciliary services.
The most marked trend in residential care
provision over recent years has been the
continuing increase in the number of places
provided in the private and voluntary sectors
and the corresponding fall in the number
provided in local authorities’ own homes.
As part of their responsibility for social
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people (‘sheltered
accommodation’); some of these developments
have resident wardens. Housing associations
and private builders also build such
accommodation. Many local authorities
provide free or subsidised travel for elderly
people within their areas.
A Royal Commission on the funding of
long-term care for elderly people in the UK
was set up in December 1997. It is expected to
report by the end of 1998. A long-term care
charter is being developed.
Disabled People
About 8.6 million disabled adults live in
private households. Over the past ten years
there has been increasing emphasis on
rehabilitation and on the provision of day,
domiciliary and respite support services to
enable disabled people to live independently
in the community wherever possible.
Local social services departments help with
social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and to
publicise services. These may include advice
on personal and social problems arising from
disability, as well as on occupational,
educational, social and recreational facilities,
either at day centres or elsewhere. Other
services provided may include adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs,
stairlifts and ground-floor toilets), the delivery
of cooked meals, and help with personal care
at home. In cases of greatest need, help may be
given with installing a telephone or a
television. Local authorities and voluntary
organisations may provide severely disabled
people with residential accommodation or
temporary facilities to allow their carers relief
from their duties. Special housing may be
available for those able to look after
themselves.
Some authorities provide free or subsidised
travel for disabled people on public transport,
and they are encouraged to provide special
means of access to public buildings.
The Disability Discrimination Act 1995:
• provides a right for disabled people not
to be discriminated against in
employment, and places a duty on
employers with 20 or more staff to
consider reasonable adjustments to the
terms on which they offer employment
where these would help to overcome the
practical effects of a disability; and
• provides a right of access to goods and
services which makes it unlawful to
refuse to serve a disabled person and may
require service providers to make
reasonable adjustments to their services
to make them more accessible. The
provisions requiring ‘reasonable
adjustments’ will be implemented in
stages between 1999 and 2004.
The National Disability Council, set up
under the Act, advises the Government on
eliminating discrimination against disabled
people. A task force has been set up to make
recommendations on establishing a Disability
Rights Commission to protect, promote and
help enforce the rights of disabled people.
In 1997 the Government transferred
responsibility for disability issues from the
Department of Social Security to the
Department for Education and Employment.
This is intended to signal a move away from
treating disabled people merely as recipients
of benefits towards a culture which will value
their role in society as people willing and able
167
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
to take advantage of education, training and
employment opportunities. (See p. 155 for
details of the Government’s New Deal for
Disabled People, which is designed to help
disabled people find and keep work.)
People with Learning Disabilities
(Mental Handicap)
The Government’s policy is to encourage the
development of local services for people with
learning disabilities and their families through
co-operation between health authorities, local
authorities, education and training services,
and voluntary and other organisations.
Local authority social services departments
are the leading statutory agency for planning
and arranging services for people with
learning disabilities. They provide or arrange
short-term care, support for families in their
own homes, residential accommodation and
support for various types of activities outside
the home. The main aims are to ensure that as
far as possible people with learning disabilities
can lead full lives in their communities and are
admitted to hospital only when it is necessary
on health grounds. People with learning
disabilities form the largest group for local
authority-funded day centre places and the
second largest group in residential care.
The NHS provides specialist services when
the ordinary primary care services cannot
meet healthcare needs. Residential care is
provided for those with severe or profound
disabilities whose needs can only effectively be
met by the NHS.
Mentally 111 People
Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental illnesses should have access to all
the services they need as locally as possible. In
England, the cornerstone of community care
policy for mentally ill people is the Care
Programme Approach. Under this, each patient
should receive an assessment and a care plan,
have a key worker appointed to keep in touch
with him or her, and be given regular reviews.
The Care Programme Approach is subject to
audit, enabling health authorities to identify
any problems with the quality of its
implementation. The separate Welsh Mental
Health Strategy employs many of the same
broad principles in delivering services in Wales.
While the total number of places for
mentally ill people in the large hospitals has
continued to fall, this has been matched by
increasing provision of alternative places in
smaller NHS hospitals, local authority
accommodation and private and voluntary
sector homes.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care and
after care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social
centres and residential care. Social workers
help patients and their families with
problems caused by mental illness. In some
cases they can apply for a mentally
disordered person to be compulsorily
admitted to and detained in hospital. In
England and Wales the Mental Health Act
Commission (in Scotland the Mental Welfare
Commission and in Northern Ireland the
Mental Health Commission) provides
important safeguards for patients to ensure
that the law is used appropriately.
A grant of £73.3 million for 1998—99 to
local authorities in England is designed to
encourage them to increase the level of social
care available to mentally ill patients,
including those with dementia who need
specialist psychiatric care in the community.
Supervision registers for discharged
patients most at risk are maintained by the
providers of services for mentally ill people
and allow hospital staff to keep track of them.
For details of the Government’s Homeless
Mentally 111 initiative, see p. 352.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with those suffering from mental
illness (such as MIND and SANE), or
learning disabilities (such as MENCAP), and
they play an important role in providing
services for both groups of people.
An independent report on mental health
policy was published in May 1998. The
report, which has been welcomed by the
Government, recommends the provision of
24-hour crisis intervention by all mental
health services; a national framework of
minimum standards for health and social care;
and defining the level of expertise and agency
168
SOCIAL PROTECTION
co-operation needed by GPs and their primary
care teams. The Government is to publish a
new mental health strategy in late 1998. In
Scotland, a Framework for Mental Health
Services was published in September 1997.
Help to Families
Local authorities must safeguard the welfare
of any child in need, and promote the
upbringing of such children by their families,
by providing a range and level of services
appropriate to those children’s needs. These
services can include advice, guidance,
counselling, help in the home, or family
centres and can be provided for the family of
the child in need or any member of the family,
if this will safeguard the child’s welfare. Local
authorities can provide these services directly
or arrange for them to be provided by, for
example, a voluntary organisation. They are
also required to publicise the help available to
families in need. Many local authorities or
specialist voluntary organisations run refuges
for women, often with young children, whose
home conditions have become intolerable,
through, for example, domestic violence. The
refuges provide short-term accommodation
and support while attempts are made to relieve
the women’s problems.
Day Care for Children
Day care facilities for children under five are
provided by local authorities, voluntary
agencies and privately. In allocating places in
their day nurseries and other facilities, local
authorities give priority to children with
special social, learning or health needs. Local
authorities also register and inspect
childminders, private day nurseries and
playgroups in their areas and provide support
and advice services.
In 1997 the Government announced plans
to develop an integrated childcare system to
match the requirements of the modern labour
market and help parents, especially women, to
balance family and working life.(See chapter 9,
p. 117, for details of out-of-school childcare
facilities for children over age 5.)
Child Protection
Cases of child abuse are the joint concern of a
number of different agencies and professions.
Area child protection committees provide
forums for discussion and co-ordination and
draw up policies and procedures for handling
cases.
Children in Care
Local government authorities must provide
accommodation for children who have no parent
or guardian, who have been abandoned, or
whose parents are unable to provide for them.
In England and Wales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if he
or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed to
moral danger, beyond the control of parents, or
not attending school. The court can commit
children to the care of a local authority under a
care order. Certain preconditions have to be
satisfied to justify an order. These are that the
children are suffering or are likely to suffer
significant harm because of a lack of reasonable
parental care or because they are beyond
parental control. However, an order is made
only if the court is also satisfied that this will
positively contribute to the children’s well¬
being and be in their best interests. In court
proceedings children are entitled to separate
legal representation and the right to have a
guardian to protect their interests. All courts
have to treat the welfare of children as the
paramount consideration when reaching any
decision about their upbringing. The law
requires that wherever possible children should
remain at home with their families.
In Scotland children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection
may be brought before a children’s hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement on
a child if it thinks that compulsory measures are
appropriate. Under these requirements most
children are allowed to remain at home under
the supervision of a social worker, but some may
live with foster parents or in a residential
establishment while under supervision.
Supervision requirements are reviewed at least
once a year until ended by a children’s hearing.
In Northern Ireland the juvenile court may
place children who are in need of care,
169
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
protection or control into the care of a fit
person (including a health and social services
board or trust), or may make them subject to a
supervision order.
The Government is to produce a national
childcare management strategy later in 1998
with the aim of improving standards for
children in public care.
Fostering and Children’s Homes
Local authorities have a duty to ensure that the
welfare of children being looked after away from
home is properly safeguarded as regards their
health, education, contact with their families
and general quality of life. When appropriate,
children in care are placed with foster parents,
who receive payments to cover the child’s living
costs. Alternatively, the child may be placed in
residential care. Children’s homes are provided
for a range of purposes and may also be
registered as schools. They may be run by local
authorities, voluntary or private organisations
and are subject to formal inspections.
Parents of children in care retain their
parental responsibilities but act as far as
possible as partners with the authority. Local
authorities are required to produce a plan for
the future of each child in their care and to
prepare a child for leaving their care and to
continue to advise him or her up to the age of
21; they are also required to have a complaints
procedure with an independent element to
cover children in their care.
A review of the safeguards in England and
Wales for children living away from home was
set up in 1996 after a series of allegations of
child abuse in residential homes dating back to
the 1970s. Its report (The Utting Report),
published in 1997, recommended that the
Government should: implement a
comprehensive strategy for residential child
care; legislate to regulate private foster care; and
extend legislation to include registration of all
boarding schools and small children’s homes.
The Government is preparing to implement the
recommendations.
Recent Trends
The number of children looked after by local
authorities in England has declined since 1992
and the proportion of foster placements has
gradually risen. The number of children in
local authority day care has declined sharply
since 1994. The number of children on child
protection registers, after falling in 1992-93,
has remained relatively stable.

Adoption
Local authority social services departments
are required by law to provide an adoption
service, either directly or by arrangement
with approved voluntary adoption societies. It
is illegal to receive an unrelated child for
adoption through an unapproved third party.
The Registrars-General keep confidential

Adopted people may be given details of
their original birth record on reaching the age
of 18 (or 16 if adopted in Scotland), and
counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
enables adopted adults and their birth parents
to be given a safe and confidential way of
making contact if that is the wish of both
parties. A person’s details are entered only if
they wish to be contacted. In Scotland a
similar service is provided through BirthLink.

particular, who are available for adoption is

children have been adopted annually. Of
those, about half are adopted by one legal
parent and a new partner, following marriage
or remarriage.
Finance
In 1995-96 nearly 50% of local authorities’
spending on personal social services was on
elderly people (see pie chart). The biggest
single item of expenditure was residential care
for older people, which accounted for 25% of
all gross personal social services spending.
During the same period the greater part of
local authorities’ spending on children’s
services involved the provision of community
homes, fostering and field social work.
Following the Comprehensive Spending
Review (see p. 389), the Government is to
invest nearly £3,000 million in local authority
social services.

provided by partnerships between universities
and colleges of higher and further education.
At present the Central Council for
Education and Training in Social Work
(CCETSW) is the statutory body responsible
for promoting and regulating social work
training. Following a review in 1997 of the
functions of the CCETSW, the Government
plans to replace the existing body with a
General Social Care Council. This would
combine the regulation of professional social
work training with that of standards of conduct
and practice for social services staff. A separate
regulatory body for Scotland is also proposed.
Professional social workers (including those
in the NHS) are employed mainly by the
social services departments of local authorities
(local authority social work departments in
Scotland; and Health, and Social Services
Trusts in Northern Ireland). There is also a
growing independent sector.
Each of the four countries of the UK has a
personal social services training strategy whose
objectives include increasing the supply of
qualified social workers, and improving the
quality of both qualifying training and the
training of the existing workforce.

Social Security
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need by providing income during
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from disablement.
As the largest single area of government
spending, social security amounts to about
30% of all public expenditure, compared with
13.5% in 1949-50, the first full year after the
introduction of the Welfare State. Total
spending on benefits is expected to increase
from £94,100 million in 1997-98 to £98,300
million in 1998-99. The area projected to
grow fastest during this period is spending on
people over working age.
There are many reasons for this growth in
expenditure, not least the increasing number
and range of benefits, as social security has
expanded to cover both a wider range of
contingencies and the changing shape and
expectations of society.

Changes in the benefits system over
50 years
• In 1948 two-thirds of claimants
drawing national assistance—as
Income Support was then called—
were over retirement age. Now over
two-thirds are below retirement age.
• While the numbers drawing the state
retirement pension have doubled
since 1948, the main growth in
disability benefits, for example, has
been among people below retirement
age.
• The same is true of housing benefits,
and the number of children living in
households drawing the minimum
income benefit has increased over
threefold since the 1960s.
helping people improve their position); it has
failed to adapt to social change, consigning
lone parents and long-term sick and disabled
people to a life of dependence; and it is also
susceptible to fraud.
The Green Paper New Ambitions for our
Country, published in March 1998, sets out
the framework for welfare reform, based on
eight principles, together with a number of
measures of success for each principle, to
gauge progress over the next 10 to 20 years.
The central aim is to replace a cycle of
dependency and insecurity with an ethic of
work and savings.
Reforms will tackle three key problems:
inequality and social exclusion (see p. 115),
especially among children and pensioners;
barriers to paid work, including financial
disincentives; and fraud that is taking money
out of the system and away from genuine
claimants.
MODERNISING THE SYSTEM
The Welfare Reform Green Paper
The Government considers that the need for
change to the benefits system is
overwhelming. It says that despite increasing
levels of spending, the present system has
failed to prevent poverty, dependence and
social exclusion. One person in five now lives
on less than half of the average income,
compared with one in ten in 1979. Similarly
the proportion of households with no one
working has doubled since 1979 to one in five.
The system is so complex that many
unemployed people do not realise how much
better off they could be by working. The
present system is passive, concentrating on
processing claims and paying benefits (without
The Eight Principles
The Government has identified eight
principles to guide its reform programme:
• the new welfare state should help and
encourage people of working age to work
when they are capable of doing so;
• the public and private sectors should
work in partnership to ensure that,
wherever possible, people are insured
against foreseeable risks and make
provision for their retirement;
• the new welfare state should provide public
services of high quality to the whole
community, as well as cash benefits;
• those who are disabled should get the
support they need to lead a fulfilling life
with dignity;
172
SOCIAL PROTECTION
• the system should support families and
children as well as tackling child poverty;
• there should be specific action to attack
social exclusion and help those in
poverty;
• the system should encourage openness
and honesty, and there should be greater
transparency about entitlement and costs;
and
• the system of delivering modern welfare
should be flexible, efficient and easy for
people to use.
Fighting Fraud
Recent measures to improve the prevention
and detection of fraud in the social security
system, which costs the taxpayer an estimated
£4,000 million a year, include:
• The Social Security Administration
(Fraud) Act 1997, which has powers to
deal with Housing Benefit fraud,
including landlord fraud. The Act,
among other measures:
- creates a new criminal offence of
obtaining benefit by false
representation;
- permits certain government
departments and local authorities to
share data with each other;
- allows local authorities to demand
information from certain landlords
about their property holdings;
- enables local authority investigators to
gain entry to business premises and to
examine business records; and
- offers people who commit benefit
fraud the choice of paying a financial
penalty instead of facing prosecution.
• The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate, which
came into operation in November 1997,
examines and reports on standards of
performance in the administration of all
social security benefits, in particular anti¬
fraud work, within the Department of
Social Security’s agencies and local
authorities.
Actions to counter benefit fraud saved over
£70 million in 1996—97 compared with £20.7
million in 1993—94.
ADMINISTRATION
Administration of social security in Great
Britain is handled by five separate executive
agencies of the Department of Social Security
(DSS), together employing a total of around
94,000 staff:
• the Benefits Agency administers and pays
the majority of benefits;
• the Child Support Agency assesses and
collects maintenance payments for
children (see p. 179);
• the Contributions Agency1 handles
National Insurance (NI) contributions;
• the Information Technology Services
Agency computerises the administration
of social security; and
• the War Pensions Agency delivers
services to war pensioners.
In Great Britain the Housing and Council
Tax Benefit schemes are administered by local
authorities. In Northern Ireland, NI
contributions and social security benefits are
administered by the Social Security Agency.
The Housing Benefit scheme is administered
by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
and the Rate Collection Agency; council tax
does not apply in Northern Ireland, where
domestic ‘rates’ are still collected.
Advice about Benefits
The DSS produces a range of leaflets and
posters and a website providing general
information on entitlement and liability. The
leaflets and posters are available in English
and a number of other languages. The Benefit
Enquiry Line is a confidential telephone
service offering general advice on benefits to
people with disabilities and their carers. The
number is: 0800 88 22 00.
1 From April 1999, the Agency will merge with the Inland
Revenue to provide customers with a single point of
contact for tax and National Insurance matters.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance (NI)
benefits such as Retirement Pension,
Incapacity Benefit, contributory Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Maternity Allowance and
Widow’s Benefit, is dependent upon the
payment of contributions. There are five
classes of contributions. The rates given
below are effective from April 1998 to
April 1999:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. Employees with earnings
below £64 a week do not pay Class 1
contributions. Contributions on earnings
at or above a lower earnings limit of £64
a week in non-contracted out
employment are at the rate of 2% of the
first £64 of total earnings and 10% of the
balance, up to the upper earnings limit of
£485 a week. Employers’ contributions
are subject to the same threshold. On
earnings above the threshold,
contributions rise in stages from 3% of
total earnings up to a maximum of 10%
when earnings are £210 or more a week;
there is no upper earnings limit. The
contribution is lower if the employer
operates a ‘contracted-out’ occupational
pension scheme (see p. 176).
• Class 1A—paid by employers who
provide their employees with fuel and/or
a car for private use. A Class 1A
contribution is payable on the cash
equivalent of the benefit provided.
• Class 2—paid by self-employed people.
Class 2 contributions are at a flat rate of
£6.35 a week. The self-employed may
claim exemption from Class 2
contributions if their profits are expected
to be below £3,590 for the 1998—99 tax
year. Self-employed people are not
eligible for unemployment and industrial
injuries benefits.
• Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Contributions are
at a flat rate of £6.25 a week.
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower limit
(£7,310 a year), and up to a set upper limit
(£25,220 a year) in addition to their Class
2 contribution. Class 4 contributions are
payable at the rate of 6%.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to
be liable. Self-employed people over
pensionable age do not pay contributions.
NI Reform
Major reforms to NI contributions were
announced in the March 1998 Budget. These
are designed to improve incentives to work,
and cut down on bureaucracy.
• At present employees who earn at or
above the lower earnings limit pay NI
contributions on the whole of their
earnings. From April 1999 neither
employees nor employers will pay NI
contributions on earnings below the
lower earnings limit.
• From April 1999, the amount an
employee can earn before employer NI
contributions are charged will be aligned
with the personal allowance for income
tax (see p. 394).
• The present system of multiple
contributions rates for employers will be
replaced by a single employer rate of
12.2%.
BENEFITS
Social security benefits can be grouped into
three types:
• means-tested, available to people whose
income and savings are below certain
levels;
• contributory, paid to people who have
made the required contributions to the
National Insurance Fund,2 from which
benefits are paid; and
2 The National Insurance Fund is a statutory fund into
which all NI contributions payable by employers,
employees and self-employed people are deposited, and
from which contributory benefits and their administration
costs are paid.

• benefits which are neither means-
tested nor contributory (mainly paid
to cover extra costs, for example of
disability, or paid universally, for
example Child Benefit).
General taxation provides over half the
income for the social security programme,
employers’ NI contributions around a quarter
and employees’ NI contributions about a fifth.
Appeals about claims for benefits are decided
by independent tribunals. For most
contributory benefits there are two conditions.
First, before benefit can be paid at all, a
certain number of contributions must have
been paid. Second, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless contributions have been
paid or credited to a specific level over a set
period. A reduced rate of benefit is payable
dependent on the level of contributions paid
or credited. For example, a great many of
those receiving retirement pensions and
widows’ benefits receive a percentage-based
rate of benefit. Benefits are increased annually
in line with percentage increases in retail
prices. The main benefits (payable weekly) are
summarised on pp. 175-83. Rates given are
those effective from April 1998 until
April 1999.
Retirement
A state Retirement Pension is a taxable
weekly benefit payable, if the contribution
conditions have been met, to women at the
age of 60 and men at the age of 65. Legislation
was introduced in 1995 to equalise the state
pension age for men and women at 65. The
change will be phased in over ten years,
starting from April 2010. Women born before
6 April 1950 will not be affected; their pension
age will remain at 60. The new pension age of
65 will apply to women born on or after 6
April 1955. Pension age for women born
between these dates will move up gradually
from 60 to 65.
The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of £64.70 for a single
person and £103.40 for a married couple,
together with an additional earnings-related
pension (sometimes called ‘SERFS’—state
earnings-related pension). Pensioners may
have unlimited earnings without affecting
their pensions. Those who have put off their
retirement during the five years after state
pension age may earn extra pension.
A non-contributory retirement pension of
£38.70 a week is payable to people aged 80 or
over who have lived in Britain for at least 10
years since reaching the age of 60, and who
have not qualified for a contributory pension.
People whose pensions do not give them
enough to live on may be entitled to Income
Support (see p. 178).
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded for
people whose opportunities to work are
limited while they are looking after a child or a
sick or disabled person. Men and women may
receive the same basic pension, provided they
have paid full-rate NI contributions when
working. The earnings-related pension
scheme will eventually be calculated as 20%
rather than 25% of earnings, to be phased in
over ten years from 1999. However, the
pensions of people retiring this century will be
unaffected.
As part of its plan to improve the income of
women in retirement, the Government is to

divorcing couples. The arrangements are
expected to be in force from April 2000.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their employees
from the state scheme for the additional
earnings-related pension and provide their
own occupational pension instead. Their
pension must be at least as good as the state
additional pension. Joining an employer’s
contracted-out scheme is voluntary: employers
are not free to contract out employees from
the earnings-related pension scheme without
the employees’ consent. The State remains
responsible for the basic pension.
Occupational pension schemes have 9.3
million members. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
176
SOCIAL PROTECTION
pensionable age, who are unable or do not
want to transfer their pension rights, are now
offered some protection against inflation.
Workers leaving a scheme have the right to a
fair transfer value. The trustees or managers
of pension schemes have to provide full
information about their schemes. Average
weekly income from an occupational pension
is around £50 for men and £30 for women.
As an alternative to their employers’
scheme or the state additional earnings-related
pension scheme, people are entitled to choose
a personal pension available from a bank,
building society, insurance company or other
financial institution. In 1995—96, 13.8 million
people contracted out of the state earnings-
related pension scheme and took out personal
pensions. Legislation passed in 1995 requires
occupational schemes to provide equal
treatment between men and women and to
make personal pensions more flexible and
attractive to a broader age-range.
The Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints of maladministration against
occupational and personal pension schemes and
adjudicates on disputes of fact or law. A pensions
registry helps people trace lost benefits.
Pensions Review
In July 1997 the Government announced a
wide-ranging review of pensions. It considers
that the failure over the past 20 years to develop
an adequate pensions strategy has resulted in
widening inequalities among pensioners. Its
long-term objective is to ensure that everyone
has the opportunity to build up an adequate
pension to guarantee security in retirement.
The review is looking at the central areas
of insecurity for elderly people including all
aspects of the basic pension and its value,
and second pensions including SERPS
(see p. 175). The Government intends to
retain the basic state pension as the foundation
of pension provision and SERPS for those
who wish to remain in it. It will aim to achieve
a broad-based agreement for the long-term
future of pensions.
It also wants to support and strengthen the
framework for occupational pensions. A
consultation document was published in
November 1997 containing proposals on
stakeholder pensions for those who cannot join
an employer’s occupational pension scheme
because of low earnings. Plans are also being
developed for citizenship pensions for carers
who are unable to contribute to a second
pension in their own right.
As part of the review, the Government has
commissioned a report on the present state of
pension provision in the UK and likely future
trends. It has also set up a working group to
look at ways of improving awareness of pensions
issues. The Government intends to publish an
initial framework for change in late 1998.
Unemployment
Jobseeker’s Allowance
Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) is a benefit for
people needing financial support because of
unemployment. Claimants must be actively
seeking work, and be capable of, and available
for, work. They must normally be aged at least
18 years and under pension age. JSA can be
either contribution-based or income-based:
• Contribution-based JSA\ those who have
paid enough NI contributions are entitled
to a personal JSA for up to six months
(£50.35 for a person aged 25 or over),
regardless of any savings or partner’s
income.
• Income-based JSA: those on a low income
are entitled to an income-based JSA,
payable for as long as the jobseeker
requires support and continues to satisfy
the qualifying conditions. The amount a
claimant receives comprises an age-
related personal allowance (£50.35 for a
person aged 25 or over), allowances for
dependent children and premium
payments for those with extra expenses,
for example, disabled children.
Benefit is paid at rates determined by family
circumstances on a basis similar to Income
Support (see below).
Back to Work Bonus
Recipients of JSA (see above) and people aged
under 60 who receive Income Support can
177
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
benefit from a Back to Work Bonus. This is
intended to increase incentives to take up or
keep part-time work, and encourage people to
move off benefit and into employment, Those
who have been unemployed for three months
or more and are working part-time may keep
the first £5 of their earnings (£10 for couples;
£15 for lone parents, disabled people and
some people in special occupations) in any
week in which they work while receiving
benefit. An amount equal to half of any
earnings above that level counts towards the
build-up of a bonus amount. When the
unemployed person moves off JSA because of
an increase in earnings or hours of work, he or
she will be able to claim a tax-free lump sum
of up to £1,000. The part-time (up to 24
hours a week) earnings of a partner can also
contribute towards building up a Back to
Work Bonus, which can be paid if the couple
leave benefit as a result of an increase in the
partner’s earnings or hours of work.
The Government is to evaluate the
effectiveness of the Back to Work Bonus in
contributing to its Welfare-to-Work
objectives.
Income Support
Income Support is payable to certain people
aged 16 or over who are not required to be
available for work, and whose income and
savings are below certain set levels. They
include lone parents, pensioners, carers and
long-term sick and disabled people. Income
Support is made up of: a personal allowance
based on age and on whether the claimant is
single, a lone parent or has a partner; age-
related allowances for dependent children and
additional sums known as premiums; and
housing costs. From this total amount other
income, including some other social security
benefits, is deducted.
Income support is not payable if savings
exceed £8,000. Savings between £3,000 and
£8,000 will reduce the amount received. For
people living permanently in residential care
or a nursing home, the allowance is not
payable if savings exceed £16,000; and savings
between £10,000 and £16,000 will affect the
amount received.
The Government has stated its concern
about some one million pensioners who fail to
claim the income support to which they are
entitled and has commissioned research into
the reasons for this.
Earnings Top-up
While Family Credit (see p. 180) helps people
with dependent children to be better off in
work, there has been no similar provision for
single people and couples without children. A
new benefit—Earnings Top-up—has been
introduced on a pilot basis in eight areas of the
UK to test whether topping up wages for
workers without dependent children helps
them get jobs and stay in work. The new
benefit is being tested at two different levels,
with different rates for couples and single
people, and is the first social security benefit
to be introduced on a pilot basis. An intensive
research and evaluation programme has
already begun.
See chapter 11 for details of the
Government’s Welfare-to-Work programme,
which offers opportunities to work for all
people of working age who have, in its opinion,
been left to depend on benefit for too long.
Families
Most pregnant working women receive
Statutory Maternity Pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18
weeks to any woman who has been working
for the same employer for 26 weeks and who
earns on average at least £64 a week. She will
receive 90% of her average weekly earnings
for the first 6 weeks and a lower rate of £57.70
a week for the remaining 12 weeks.
Women who are not eligible for Statutory
Maternity Pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, or have recently changed jobs
or left their job, may qualify for a weekly
Maternity Allowance, which is payable for
up to 18 weeks. This amounts to £57.70 a
week for employees and £50.10 a week for the
self-employed and those not in work. All
pregnant employees have the right to take 14
weeks’ maternity leave.
An additional payment of £100 from the
Social Fund (see p. 180) may be made if the
178
SOCIAL PROTECTION
mother or her partner receive Income
Support, income-related Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Family Credit or Disability
Working Allowance. It is also available if a
baby is adopted.
The main social security benefit for children
is Child Benefit. This is a tax-free, non¬
contributory payment of £11.45 a week for the
eldest qualifying child of a couple, and £9.30
for each other child. A higher rate of £17.10 is
payable for the eldest qualifying child of a
person bringing up a child on their own,
whether they are the child’s parent or not.
Child Benefit is payable for children up to the
age of 16, and for those up to 19 who continue
in full-time non-advanced education. It is
generally not payable to people whose entry to
the UK is subject to immigration control.
A person claiming Child Benefit for an
orphaned child they have taken into their
family may be entitled to Guardian’s
Allowance. This is a tax-free non¬
contributory benefit of £11.30 a week,
reduced to £9.90 a week if a higher rate of
Child Benefit is in payment. In certain
circumstances Guardian’s Allowance can be
paid when only one parent is dead.
Child Support Agency
An estimated 1 million lone parents in the UK
bring up 1.8 million children in households
where no one is working. The Child Support
Agency (CSA) and its counterpart in
Northern Ireland are responsible for assessing
child maintenance and, where requested by
either parent, collecting and enforcing child
maintenance payments from, and for tracing,
absent parents.
If any person is living with and caring for a
child, and one, or both, of the child’s parents
are living elsewhere in the UK, he or she may
apply to have child support maintenance
assessed and collected by the CSA (or its
Northern Ireland counterpart). If that person
or their present partner claims Income
Support, income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Family Credit or Disability
Working Allowance, they may be required to
apply for child support maintenance if asked
to do so by the CSA (or its Northern Ireland
counterpart).
Assessments for child support maintenance
are made using a formula which takes into
account each parent’s income and makes
allowance for essential outgoings. (A system of
departures from the formula allows the
amount of maintenance payable to be varied in
a small number of cases.) A child maintenance
bonus worth up to £ 1,000 may be payable to
parents living with and caring for a child who
have been in receipt of Income Support or
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and in
receipt of child maintenance when they leave
benefit for work.
The Green Paper Children First: a New
Approach to Child Support was published in
July 1998, setting out the Government’s
proposals for a new local, customer-focused
child support scheme based on a radically
simpler method of assessment. The paper also
proposes that parents living with and caring
for a child who are on Income Support be
allowed to keep up to £10 a week of any
maintenance paid for their children. The new
scheme is unlikely to be introduced before
2001. However, many improvements are
already underway or planned. These include:
extended working hours; a simpler and more
efficient process for making and appealing
decisions; and reorganisation of the Child
Support Agency to centralise processing work
and free local staff to concentrate on meeting
clients face to face.
Childcare Costs
Families claiming Family Credit, Disability
Working Allowance, Housing Benefit and
Council Tax Benefit, and who pay for
childcare for children aged under 12, can have
up to £60 a week in formal childcare costs
offset against their earnings when their benefit
entitlement is worked out. Since June 1998 the
disregard for childcare costs has been
increased from a maximum of £60 to £100 a
week for families who pay childcare costs for
two or more children in the family, and the
maximum eligible age increased from 11 to 12.
From October 1999 the maximum childcare
disregards will be increased to £100 for
families where there is one child, and to
£ 150 for families who have two or more
children.
179
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
As part of its Welfare-to-Work programme
(see chapter 11), the Government has
implemented a national childcare strategy that
will help lone mothers to get work instead of
being dependent on benefits (see p. 117).
Family Credit
Family Credit is a tax-free benefit payable to
low-income working families with children. It
is payable to couples or lone parents. At least
one parent must work for at least 16 hours a
week. The amount payable depends on a
family’s net weekly income; the number and
ages of the children in the family; the amount
of certain childcare charges paid; and the
number of hours worked.
A maximum amount of Family Credit
(consisting of an adult credit, plus a credit for
each child varying with age, and an extra
credit if one parent works for at least 30 hours
a week), is payable if the family’s net weekly
income is less than £79.00. If income is more
than £79.00, 70 pence of every £1 of the
excess is deducted from the maximum
payable.
Child Benefit, Child Benefit (Lone Parent)
and the first £15 of any maintenance in
payment are not counted as income. And
certain childcare charges can be offset against
earnings before entitlement to Family Credit
is calculated. The capital limit for Income
Support (see p. 178) also applies to Family
Credit.
From October 1999 Family Credit will be
replaced by Working Families’ Tax Credit
(WFTC). By introducing a higher income
threshold before WFTC is withdrawn and
withdrawing it at a rate of 55% rather than
70% as with Family Credit, WFTC is
designed to improve work incentives and to
encourage people to move into and remain in
employment. It is central to the
Government’s major programme of tax and
benefit reform, representing a step towards
greater integration of the tax and benefits
systems. At the same time, a new childcare
tax credit, forming part of WFTC, will be
introduced. It will be worth 70% of eligible
childcare costs up to £100 a week for families
with one child and £150 for families with two
or more children, thus giving greater help
with childcare costs than at present available
within Family Credit.
Social Fund
Payments, in the form of loans or grants, may
be available to people on low incomes to help
with expenses which are difficult to pay for
out of regular income. There are two kinds.
Discretionary payments are:
• budgeting loans for important
intermittent expenses;
• community care grants to help, for
example, people resettle into the
community from care, or to remain in the
community, to ease exceptional pressure
on families, to set up home as part of a
planned resettlement programme and to
meet certain travel expenses; and
• crisis loans to help people in an emergency
or as a result of a disaster where there is
serious risk to health or safety. People do
not have to be receiving any form of
benefit to qualify for this loan.
The total discretionary budget for 1998-99 is
£501.2 million.
The Social Fund also provides regulated
payments (payments that are not cash-limited)
to help people awarded certain income-related
benefits with the costs of maternity or
funerals, or with heating during very cold
weather and winter fuel payments.
Widows
Widow’s Payment. Widows under the age of
60—or those over 60 whose husbands were
not entitled to a state retirement pension when
they died—receive a tax-free single payment
of £1,000 following the death of their
husbands, provided that their husbands have
paid a minimum number of NI contributions.
Women whose husbands have died of an
industrial injury or prescribed disease may
also qualify, regardless of whether their
husbands have paid NI contributions.
Widowed Mother’s Allowance, a taxable
benefit of £64.70 a week, is payable to a
widowed mother with at least one child for
whom she is getting Child Benefit. Additional
180
SOCIAL PROTECTION
tax-free amounts of £9.90 for a child for
whom the higher rate of Child Benefit is
payable, and £11.30 for each subsequent child
are available.
Widow’s Pension. A taxable, weekly benefit
of £64.70 a week is payable to a widow who is
55 years or over when her husband dies or when
her entitlement to Widowed Mother’s
Allowance ends. A percentage of the full rate is
payable to widows who are aged between 45 and
54 when their husbands die or when their
entitlement to Widowed Mother’s Allowance
ends. Special rules apply for widows whose
husbands died before 11 April 1988.
Entitlement continues until the widow
remarries or begins drawing retirement
pension. Payment ends if she lives with a man
as his wife.
A man whose wife dies when both are over
pension age inherits his wife’s pension rights
just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
Sickness and Disablement
A variety of benefits are available for people
unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying Statutory Sick Pay to employees
from the fourth day of sickness for up to a
maximum of 28 weeks. There is a single rate
of Statutory Sick Pay for all qualifying
employees provided their average weekly
earnings are at least £64 a week. The weekly
rate is £57.70.
Incapacity Benefit is for people who
become incapable of work while they are
employed. Entitlement to Incapacity Benefit
begins when entitlement to Statutory Sick Pay
ends or, for those who do not qualify for
Statutory Sick Pay, from the first day of
sickness. There are three types:
• short-term benefit for people under
pension age: lower rate of £48.80 a week
for the first 28 weeks; and a higher rate of
£57.70 a week between the 29th and
52nd week;
• short-term benefit for people over
pension age, with a single rate of £62.05;
and
• long-term benefit rate of £64.70 a week
(after 52 weeks of incapacity).
Extra benefits may be paid for dependent
adults and children. Incapacity Benefit is
taxable from the 29th week of incapacity.
The medical test of incapacity for work
usually applies after 28 weeks’ sickness. It
assesses ability to perform a range of work-
related activities rather than the ability to
perform a specific job.
Severe Disablement Allowance is a tax-
free benefit for people who have not been able
to work for at least 28 weeks because of illness
or disability but who cannot get Incapacity
Benefit because they have not paid enough NI
contributions. The benefit is £39.10 a week,
plus additions of up to £13.60 depending on
the person’s age when they became incapable
of work. Additions for adult dependants and
for children may also be paid. Claims may be
made by people aged between 16 and 65. Once
a person has qualified for the allowance, there
is no upper age limit for receipt. New
claimants must satisfy the same incapacity test
as that used in Incapacity Benefit (see above).
People who become incapable of work after
their 20th birthday must also be medically
assessed as at least 80% disabled for a
minimum of 28 weeks. People already in
receipt of certain benefits, such as the higher
rate of the Disability Living Allowance care
component (see below), will automatically be
accepted as 80% disabled.
Other Benefits
Disability Living Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to help severely
disabled people aged under 65 with extra costs
incurred as a result of disability. Entitlement
is measured in terms of personal care and/or
mobility needs. There are two components: a
care component which has three weekly
rates—£51.30, £34.30 and £13.60; and a
mobility component which has two weekly
rates—£35.80 and £13.60, payable from age 5
or older.
Attendance Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to provide
financial help to severely disabled people aged
65 or older with extra costs incurred as a result
of disability. It is measured in terms of
personal care needs by day and/or night. The
two rates are £51.30 and £34.30.
181
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
A non-contributory Invalid Care
Allowance of £38.70 weekly may be payable
to people between 16 and 65 who have given
up the opportunity of a full-time paid job
because they are providing regular and
substantial care of at least 35 hours a week, to
a severely disabled person in receipt of either
Attendance Allowance or the higher or middle
care component of Disability Living
Allowance. An additional carer’s premium
may be paid if the recipient is also receiving
Income Support, income-related Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Housing Benefit or Council Tax
Benefit.
Disability Working Allowance (DWA)
is a tax-free, income-related benefit for people
who work at least 16 hours a week but have an
illness or disability that limits their earning
capacity. Awards are for fixed periods of six
months. To claim, a person must be aged 16
or over and have a qualifying benefit, such as
Disability Living Allowance, or an analogous
benefit. The amount paid depends on whether
the person has a partner, and the age and
number of children living with them. The
capital limit for DWA is £16,000.
From October 1999 DWA will be replaced
by a Disabled Person’s Tax Credit payable
under the same rules as those for the new
Working Families Tax Credit (see p. 180).
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
disease caused by a particular type of
employment. The main benefit is the tax-free
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit:
up to £104.70 a week is usually paid after a
qualifying period of 15 weeks if a person is at
least 14% or more physically or mentally
disabled as a result of an industrial accident or
a prescribed disease.
Basic Disablement Benefit can be paid in
addition to other NI benefits, such as Incapacity
Benefit. It can be paid whether or not the
person returns to work and does not depend on
earnings. The degree of disablement is assessed
by an independent adjudicating medical
authority and the amount paid depends on the
extent of the disablement and on how long it is
expected to last. Except for certain progressive
respiratory diseases, disablement of less than
14% does not attract Disablement Benefit. In
certain circumstances additional allowances may
be payable.
Housing and Council Tax Benefits
Housing Benefit is an income-related, tax-
free benefit which helps people on low
incomes meet the cost of rented
accommodation. The amount paid depends on
personal circumstances, income, savings, rent
and other people sharing the home. It also
normally depends on the general level of rents
for properties with the same number of rooms
in the locality.
Most single people under 25 years old who
are not lone parents and who are renting
privately have their Housing Benefit limited to
the average cost of a single non-self-contained
room (that is, shared use of kitchen and toilet
facilities) in the locality.
Council Tax Benefit helps people to
meet their council tax payments (the tax set by
local councils to help pay for services—see
p. 65). The scheme offers help to those
claiming Income Support and income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance and others with low
incomes. It is subject to rules broadly similar
to those governing the provision of Housing
Benefit (see above). A person who is solely
liable for the council tax may also claim
benefit for a second adult who is not liable to
pay the council tax and who is living in the
home on a non-commercial basis.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement as a result
of service in the armed forces or for certain
injuries received in the merchant navy or civil
defence during wartime, or to civilians injured
by enemy action. The amount paid depends on
the degree of disablement: the pension for
100% disablement for an officer is £5,797 a
year; for other ranks itis£111.10a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for care and
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
182
SOCIAL PROTECTION
£7.40 and £22.90 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40% or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and
other dependants. (The standard rate of
pension for a private soldier’s widow is £83.90
a week.) War Widow’s Pension is also payable
to a former war widow who has remarried and
then become widowed again, divorced or
legally separated.
The War Pensioners’ Welfare Service helps
and advises war pensioners, war widows and
other dependants. It works closely with ex-
Service organisations and other voluntary
bodies which give financial help and personal
support to those disabled or bereaved as a
result of war.
Concessions
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service charges
(see p. 193), grants towards the cost of
spectacles, legal aid and free school meals (see
pp. 134, 193, 237). People on low incomes, all
pensioners, widows and long-term sick people
on Incapacity Benefit receive extra help to meet
the cost of VAT on their fuel bills.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners are
usually entitled to reduced transport fares.
Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which replace
lost earnings are subject to tax, while those
intended to meet a specific need are not (see
Table 12.5). Various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or a
need to support dependants.
Benefit Controls on People from Abroad
Residence Test
All claimants must be habitually resident in the
Common Travel Area (that is, the UK, the
Republic of Ireland, the Channel Isles or the
Isle of Man) before a claim for Income
Support, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit can be
paid. The test brings the UK into line with
most other European countries, which already
limit access to their benefit systems to those
who have lived in the country for some time.

Asylum Seekers
Generally only people who claim refugee
status as soon as they arrive in the UK can
claim income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Income Support, Housing Benefit and
Council Tax Benefit. Their eligibility to
receive this will stop if their asylum claim is
refused by the Home Office. People who claim
asylum after they have arrived in the UK are
not entitled to benefit.
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include Child
Benefit and those for sickness and maternity,
unemployment, retirement, invalidity,
accidents at work and occupational diseases.
The UK has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries
which also provide cover for some NI benefits
and family benefits.

The Government has announced a ten-year plan to modernise the National
Health Service. It has also launched a new public health strategy, setting goals
for improving the overall health of the nation which recognise the impact that
poverty, poor housing, unemployment and a polluted environment have on
health. Proposals outlining the Government's strategy for reducing smoking
are to be published during 1998.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides
a full range of medical services, available to
all residents, regardless of their income.
Central government is directly responsible
for the NHS, which is administered by a
range of health authorities and health boards
throughout the UK. The Department of
Health is responsible for national strategic
planning in England, and within that
department, the NHS Executive, with its
eight regional offices (unique to England), is
responsible for developing and implementing
policies for the provision of health services.
At present, The Scottish Office Department
of Health, the Welsh Office and the
Department of Health and Social Services
in Northern Ireland have similar
responsibilities. (But see pp. 15, 21 and 27
for planned transfer of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Office responsibilities under
the devolution programme.) Policies and
initiatives for health in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are largely consistent with
those for England, but may adopt distinctive
approaches which reflect the health variations
in the different parts of the UK.
There are 100 health authorities in
England and 5 in Wales, 15 health boards in
Scotland and 4 health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland, all of which are
responsible for identifying the healthcare
needs of the people living in their area. They
secure hospital and community health
services and arrange for the provision of
services by family doctors, dentists,
pharmacists and opticians, as well as
administering their contracts. The health
authorities and boards co-operate closely
with local authorities responsible for social
work, environmental health, education and
other services. There are community health
councils (local health councils in Scotland
and area health and social services councils in
Northern Ireland) covering all parts of the
country, representing local opinion on the
services provided.
185
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Among the major targets which the
Government has promised to deliver by
the end of this Parliament are:
• to reduce waiting lists in England to
100,000 below the figure inherited at
the May 1997 General Election;
• to deliver higher and more consistent
standards of treatment and care
throughout the NHS;
• to begin to reduce inequalities in
health, in particular targeting
premature deaths from heart disease
and stroke, cancer and mental illness;
and
• to improve the lives and prospects of
children looked after by local
authorities.
 z 
Major Policy Developments
PUBLIC HEALTH
In February 1998 the Government published a
consultation paper—Our Healthier Nation—
with proposals for a public health strategy that
would tackle the underlying causes of ill
health in England. Similar strategies have
been published for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The two main aims of Our
Healthier Nation are:
• to improve the health of the population
as a whole by increasing the length of
people’s lives and the number of years
people spend free from illness;
• to improve the health of the worst off in
society and to narrow the health gap.
The strategy proposes to set new goals for
improving the health of the population, taking
account of the effect of poverty,
unemployment, poor housing and a polluted
environment on health. Persistent inequalities
in health exist between different occupational
and ethnic groups, between geographical areas
and between men and women in the UK.
The Government hopes that by tackling
the wider influences on health it can have an
impact on health inequalities. Action already
taken includes measures to improve food
safety (see chapter 27), to discourage smoking,
and to find out more about the effects of air
pollutants commonly found in the home.
New Target Areas
The Green Paper proposes action to reduce
preventable death in four major areas, where
targets have been identified which will seek
improvements by the year 2010:
• heart disease and stroke: to reduce the
death rate among people under 65 by at
least a third (from 66.2 to 44.1 per
100,000 population);
• accidents: a reduction of at least one fifth
(from 20 to 16 per 100 people);
• cancer: to reduce the death rate among
people under 65 by at least one fifth
(from 81 to 64.8 per 100,000); and
• mental health: to reduce the death rate
from suicide and undetermined injury by
at least one sixth (from 9.2 to 7.6 per
100,000).
The Green Paper emphasises the need for
action at local level, involving health and local
authorities as well as voluntary organisations
and community groups, the private sector and
individuals. It plans to develop the health
promoting roles of the local authority
departments dealing with social services,
education, housing, recreation, public
transport, traffic, environmental health and
consumer protection. A White Paper
containing the final strategy will be published
later in 1998. Similar work is in progress in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Healthy Settings
The Government plans major initiatives in
England to tackle health inequalities and
improve health overall in three areas: healthy
schools (focusing on children); healthy
workplaces (focusing on adults); and healthy
neighbourhoods (focusing on older people). It
considers that the drive to promote better
health requires concerted action by the
Government as a whole, in partnership with
local organisations. In each area the
186
HEALTH SERVICES
Government will build on good ideas that are
already in progress and spread the good
practice.
One example of a healthy neighbourhood
scheme is the partnership between
Manchester Health Authority, Partington
Community Enterprise, and the local branch
of the Children’s Society, which has set up a
fresh fruit and vegetable co-operative run by
local volunteers. The Children’s Society
provides premises from which the co-op is run
and a minibus for deliveries or shopping trips
for local residents. The co-op is run for the
whole community although extra help is
focused on older and disabled people.
In 1997 the Government commissioned an
independent review of the latest available
information on inequalities in health and
expectation of life in England. The review is
aiming to identify the priority areas in which
the Government needs to develop policy, and
will publish a report later in 1998.
The Government’s new approach to health
has been marked by the appointment of a
Minister for Public Health, one of whose roles
is to ensure that policies across government
can be evaluated for their potential impact on
people’s health—an agenda which challenges
every department of government. Similar
action is in train in other parts of the UK.
Tobacco Control
Cigarette smoking is the greatest single cause
of preventable illness and death in the UK. It
is associated with around 120,000 premature
deaths a year—nearly one fifth of all deaths.
Health Education Authority figures released
in 1997 estimate the annual cost to the NHS
in England alone for treating related diseases
(for example, heart disease, lung cancer and
bronchitis) at between £ 1,400 million and
£1,700 million. The largest increase in
smoking rates is among teenagers, especially
girls.
In 1996 it is estimated that
• 13% of children aged 11 to 15 in England
(14% in Scotland) regularly smoked
cigarettes;
• 28% of adults aged 16 and over in
England (32% in Scotland) smoked
Healthy Living Centres
A network of Healthy Living Centres,
partly funded by £300 million from the
National Lottery (see p. 120), is being set
up throughout the UK in order to improve
the health of people of all ages, however fit
they are. However, the Centres will give
priority to schemes which reach those with
worse health than average or who may not
be using existing services. In England the
initiative will complement the Health
Action Zones (see p. 191), which also aim
to tackle inequalities in health and target
areas of deprivation. The scheme is
designed to be flexible so that projects can
be specifically tailored to meet the
differing needs of different communities.
One example is the Bromley by Bow
Centre, Tower Hamlets, London, which
began when a small church congregation
opened its building to the local
community. It is now an integrated
community project covering health,
education, arts and the environment.
Services and activities include: a day

government priority. There is wide consensus
among tobacco control experts that a broad
range of measures is needed, and the
Government is taking action on a number of
fronts.
Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Controls
The Government has stated its intention to
ban tobacco advertising. At present all tobacco
advertising is banned on television, and
cigarette advertisements are banned on radio;
other forms of advertising and promotion of
tobacco products are regulated by two
voluntary agreements between the
Government and the tobacco industry.
An EC Directive to ban tobacco advertising
and sponsorship was formally adopted by the
EU Council of Ministers in May 1998.
Member states have three years to implement
the basic provisions of the Directive; a further
two years are available beyond that for
sponsored events. All forms of tobacco
advertising and sponsorship covered by the
Directive must cease by 2006. The timescale
for implementation in UK law will be set out
in the White Paper to be published later in
1998 (see below).
Legislative Proposals
The Government is to publish a White Paper
on all aspects of tobacco control, together with
its plans for implementing the ban on tobacco
advertising, later in 1998. The Minister for
Public Health hosted a summit in July 1997
where the full range of issues was considered,
including: the scope of the advertising ban;
consumer protection; price, tax and fiscal
measures; public education; smoking in public
places; and helping people to stop smoking.
The conclusions of the summit are being used
to inform the content of the White Paper.
The NHS has a key role to play as the
White Paper proposals are developed and
implemented. The issues for the NHS range
from achieving a smoke-free NHS to
developing the role of health professionals in
public education and services to help people
give up smoking.
REFORMS IN MANAGEMENT
Management reforms introduced under the
NHS and Community Care Act 1990 created a
form of competition in the running of the
NHS—the so-called ‘internal market’. This

Scientific Committee on Tobacco
and Health
The Report of the Scientific Committee on
Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) was
published in 1998, the first major UK report
on tobacco and health for 10 years. The
report states that tobacco smoking is the
single most important avoidable cause of
chronic ill health and that avoiding smoking
would prevent a third of UK cancer deaths.
It also concluded that long-term passive
smoking in non-smokers causes a 20%-30%
increased risk of lung cancer. This could
account for several hundred lung cancer
deaths a year in the UK.
SCOTH reported that half of all active
smokers are killed by the habit unless they
are able to quit. However, so many smokers
in the UK have now managed to stop that
tobacco deaths under the age of 70 have
halved, from 80,000 in 1956 to 40,000 in
1995.
was achieved by making a division between
purchasers and providers of healthcare.
Under this system: ‘purchasers’ (health
authorities/health boards and some general
practitioners—GPs—see p. 195) were given
budgets to buy healthcare from ‘providers’
(acute hospitals; organisations providing care for
the mentally ill, people with learning disabilities
and the elderly; and ambulance services). To
become a provider in the internal market, health
organisations became NHS Trusts,
independent organisations with their own
managements, competing with each other. The
first Trusts came into operation in 1992. By
1995, all hospital and community healthcare,
other than in the Scottish island Health Board
areas, was provided by NHS Trusts.
Over the same period, many GPs were also
given their own budgets with which to buy
healthcare from NHS Trusts in a scheme
called GP fundholding. Not all GPs joined
this scheme and their budgets continued to be
controlled by health authorities/health boards,
which bought healthcare in bulk from NHS
Trusts. Patients of GP fundholders were often
able to obtain treatment more quickly than
patients of non-fundholders. This led to
accusations of the NHS’s operating a two-tier
system, contrary to the founding principles of
the NHS of fair and equal access for all to
healthcare.
Broadly similar changes were introduced
under separate legislation in Northern Ireland,
where health and personal social services are
provided on an integrated basis by health and
social services boards.
Current Reforms
In December 1997 the Government published
its White Paper, The New NHS: Modern,
Dependable, which outlines a ten-year
programme of modernisation of the NHS in
England. Similar proposals have been
published for Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland (see Further Reading). These differ in
some details from those in England but are
designed to achieve the same aim.
The White Paper proposes to abolish the
competitive internal market, whose business
culture, the Government considers, has been
at odds with the ethos of the NHS and those
who work in it. Instead a new system of
integrated care would be introduced to deliver
quicker, higher-quality services to patients.
This would form the basis for a ten-year
programme to renew and improve the NHS
through evolutionary change rather than
organisational upheaval. The Government
would retain the separation between planning
and providing services, but would end
competition and, subject to parliamentary
approval, replace it with a new statutory duty
for NHS Trusts to work in partnership with
other NHS organisations.
The Government has begun to cut the
NHS administration budget and has
announced its intention of saving £1,000
million during the course of the present
Parliament. It has already redirected the funds
into patient care, starting with screening for
women at risk of breast cancer (see p. 206) and
new intensive care facilities for children (see p.
199).
The following White Paper proposals are
subject to parliamentary approval:
Health Authorities. Health authorities will be
reduced in number and will be given stronger
189
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
powers to improve the health of their residents
and oversee the effectiveness of the NHS
locally. Over time, they will relinquish most of
their commissioning responsibilities. They
will take the lead in drawing up three-year
Health Improvement Programmes for
improving the health of their area—in
consultation with local NHS Trusts and
Primary Care Groups (see below), but also
with local authorities, voluntary bodies and
education and research institutions. The
Programmes will start in 1999. Health
authorities will allocate funds to Primary Care
Groups on an equitable basis, and hold them
to account. Links with social services will be
strengthened.
Primary Care Groups. Subject to legislation,
GP fundholding will be abolished in April
1999 and replaced by Primary Care Groups in
each area, putting GPs and community nurses
in charge of shaping services for all patients.
The Groups, which will be established as a
committee of the local health authority, will be
responsible for commissioning services for
their local communities and accountable to
health authorities. GPs and community nurses
will have a choice about the form their
primary care takes. For example, they will
have the power to become free-standing
primary care NHS trusts, able to run
community hospitals and community health
services. Typically Groups may serve about
100,000 patients. They will have a single
unified budget, which will give GPs maximum
choice in how patients’ needs are met, and no
part of which will be capped. All Primary Care
Groups will be expected to work closely with
social services to provide properly integrated
care.
NHS Trusts. NHS Trusts will remain
responsible for treatment and care, but will
also be party to the local Health Improvement
Programmes (see above). Short-term contracts
will be ended and NHS Trusts will agree
long-term service agreements with Primary
Care Groups. These service agreements will
generally be organised around care groups
(such as children) or disease areas (such as
heart disease). In this way, hospital clinicians
will have a greater say in shaping local services

for patients. From 1999 NHS Trusts will, for
the first time, have a statutory duty to co¬
operate with other parts of the NHS and to
meet quality standards. They will be required
to take part (alongside Primary Care Groups,
universities and local authorities) in
developing the Health Improvement
Programmes under the leadership of the
health authority. NHS Trusts will be more
accountable to the public and will publish
details of their performance.
As part of the Government’s drive for an
open, accountable and more efficient health
service, each NHS Trust will publish the costs
of treatments and services they deliver from
August 1998.
New Quality Standards
The White Paper proposes new standards of
quality and efficiency that will guarantee
better services for patients. National Service
190
HEALTH SERVICES
Frameworks will set national standards for a
defined service throughout the country.
Starting in April 1999, the frameworks will
specify the types of service that should be
available in all primary care, local hospitals
and specialist centres. They will also set down
quality standards that will have to be met
across the NHS. The programme will start
with taking forward the existing frameworks
for cancer (see p. 206) and paediatric intensive
care, and will begin to develop new
frameworks for mental health and coronary
heart disease.
The White Paper also sets out proposals to
establish a National Institute for Clinical
Excellence from 1999 to promote clinical and
cost-effectiveness, drawing up new guidelines
and ensuring that they reach all parts of the
health service. Its membership will be drawn
from the health professions, the NHS,
academics, health economists and patients.
Subject to parliamentary approval, an
independent Commission for Health
Improvement will be established from 1999 to
oversee the quality of clinical services at local
level, and to tackle shortcomings. It will be
able to intervene if the quality of clinical
services fails to come up to standard. The
Commission will both investigate and identify
the source of the problem, and work with the
organisation on lasting remedies. It will have
powers to visit every hospital at least every
three to four years to ensure that the standards
set by the National Service Frameworks are
being met. Patients themselves will be
represented on the Commission and its
findings will be published.
National Performance Framework
The White Paper proposes a comprehensive
framework for measuring and improving
standards of performance, efficiency and
patient care. For the first time, the NHS will
make comparisons and publish the results on
issues of concern to patients, doctors and
nurses, and health managers. The framework
will measure, among other things, death rates,
emergency readmissions for elderly people,
the costs of NHS treatment, and the length of
stay of patients in hospital. The Government
intends comparison of the results to drive up
New Initiatives in Patient Care
• NHS Direct, a new 24-hour telephone
advice line staffed by specially trained
nurses, will give on-the-spot advice
on injuries and ailments. Three pilot
schemes began in March 1998;
further schemes, covering 10 million
people, will begin in April 1999. Most
of the schemes will be run by the local
ambulance service, but one or more
will involve GP co-operatives. The
whole of the UK is expected to be
covered by 2000.
• Every GP surgery and hospital is to
be connected to NHSnet, the NHS’s
own information superhighway,
leading to quicker test results,
telemedicine, up-to-date specialist
advice in the doctor’s surgery and on¬
line booking of outpatients’
appointments. Demonstration sites
will be established in every region by
the end of 1998, and by 2002 these
services are expected to be available
across the country.
standards across the country and iron out local
variations in quality of performance.
Health Action Zones
In April 1998 the first ‘health action zones’
were set up in 11 areas of England.
Concentrated in areas of deprivation, where
the health of local people could be improved
by better integrated arrangements for
treatment and care, health action zones, which
receive government funding, involve local
partnerships between the health service, local
councils, voluntary groups and local
businesses. Their job is to make measurable
improvements in the health of local people
and in the quality of treatment and care.
Working closely with the Department of
Health, the participants will explore ways for
breaking through current organisational
boundaries to tackle inequalities, and
delivering better services and healthcare,
191
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
building upon and encouraging co-operation
across the NHS. Up to 15 further zones will
be launched in April 1999.
Examples include:
• In Tyne and Wear a new partnership
approach to the health of elderly people
is under way, with a new system of
assessing high risk, better access to public
transport, improved special housing, and
a programme to improve home insulation
and reduce hypothermia.
• In Bradford, a new community-based
diabetes service is being set up—a
partnership between the health authority,
general practice and community and
NHS Trusts to deliver integrated,
preventive, specialist and primary care.
A similar initiative to encourage local
healthcare partnerships has been launched in
Scotland.
Review of London’s Health Services
The report of an independent review of health
services in London was published in February
1998. The Government has accepted, and is
implementing, all of its recommendations.
These include, among other things, the
formation of a single health region for London
to ensure a London-wide strategy for health. As
a result of the report’s conclusion that, contrary
to the view of the previous administration,
there were not more acute hospital beds
available in London than the English average,
the Government has decided that any future
changes in bed numbers in London hospitals
will be in line with those in the rest of England.
The National Health Service
The NHS is based upon the principle that
there should be a full range of publicly funded
services designed to help the individual stay
healthy. The services are intended to provide
effective and appropriate treatment and care
where necessary while making the best use of
available resources. All taxpayers, employers
and employees contribute to their cost so that
those members of the community who do not
require healthcare help to pay for those who
do. Some forms of treatment, such as hospital
care, are generally provided free; others may
be charged for (see p. 193).
ADMINISTRATION
Expenditure
The Health Programme is funded mainly by
central government and consists of:
• NHS Hospital and Community Health
Services (HCHS), providing all hospital
care and a wide range of community
services;
• NHS Family Health Services (FHS),
providing general medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and some ophthalmic
services, and covering the cost of
medicines prescribed by GPs;
• Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS), providing services
most effectively administered centrally
(for example, certain public health
functions and support to the voluntary
sector); and
• the administrative costs of the health
departments.
The Voluntary Sector
Government grant aid to voluntary
organisations working in health and personal
social services goes primarily to national
organisations dealing with children, elderly
people, carers and people from ethnic
minorities, as well as those looking after
people with mental illness, physical or
learning disabilities, or suffering from the
effects of HIV/AIDS or the misuse of alcohol
or drugs. Grant aid to the voluntary sector in
England in 1997—98 was £52 million.
Health authorities/boards and local
authorities also make grants to local
organisations.
Finance
Almost 81% of the cost of the health service is
paid for through general taxation. The rest is
met from:

contributions (see chapter 12), paid by
employed people, their employers, and
self-employed people (12.8%);
• charges towards the cost of certain items
such as drugs prescribed by family
doctors, and general dental treatment
(2.3%);
• capital refunds from NHS Trusts
(3.2%); and
• other receipts, including land sales and
the proceeds of income generation
schemes (0.9%).
Health authorities may raise funds from
voluntary sources. Certain hospitals increase
revenue by taking private patients, who pay
the full cost of their accommodation and
treatment.
Some 500 million prescriptions, worth
almost £4,400 million, are dispensed each year
in England. In 1997-98 an estimated 85% of
medical prescription items were supplied free.
Prescription charges are not paid by: children
under 16 years (or young people under 19 who
are in full-time education); pregnant women
and women who have had a baby in the past
year; people aged 60 and over; patients with
certain medical conditions; war and armed
forces disablement pensioners (for
prescriptions which relate to the disability for
which they receive a war pension); and people
or families with low incomes.
Between £70 million and £100 million in
England and Wales is lost each year through
prescription charge evasion and some £ 15
million through theft and forgery. The
Government has announced a number of
measures to tackle this. These include
proposals for a new criminal offence of
evading prescription charges; rewarding
pharmacies for detecting stolen or
counterfeited prescription forms; and greater
use of information technology to improve
investigation and detection of fraud by NHS
contractors.
There are proportional charges for most
types of NHS dental treatment, including
examinations. However, the following people
are entitled to free treatment: women who
begin a course of treatment while pregnant or
within 12 months of having a baby, children
up to 18, full-time students under 19, and
adults on low incomes.
Since 1989 free NHS sight tests have been
restricted to children, full-time students under
the age of 19, adults on low incomes and people
who have, or are at particular risk of, eye disease.
In July 1998 the Government announced that it
would be restoring free sight tests to people aged
60 and over from April 1999.
Family practitioners (doctors, dentists,
optometrists and community pharmacists) are
self-employed (or, in the case of pharmacists,
employed by a pharmacy company) and have
contracts with the NHS. GPs are paid by a
system of fees and allowances designed to
reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. Dentists providing treatment in
their own surgeries are paid by a combination
of capitation fees for children registered with
the practice, continuing care payments for
adults registered, and a prescribed scale of fees
for individual treatments. Community
pharmacists dispense from their own or their
company’s premises and are refunded the cost
of the items supplied, together with
professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service receive
approved fees for each sight test carried out.
193
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Following the results of the
Comprehensive Spending Review (see
p. 389), the Government is to invest
additional funds into modernising the
NHS over the next three years.
In England, an investment of £20,000
million will provide, among other things:
• more NHS staff to enable NHS
hospitals to treat an extra 3 million
patients;
• a new £500,000 NHS Modernisation
Fund for specifically planned and
monitored improvements in
standards of NHS buildings, plant,
equipment, staff training and
information technology; and
• £8,000 million for new hospitals,
clinics and GP premises.
NHS Workforce
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly 1 million
people. Staff costs account for approximately
70% of current spending on hospitals and
community health services.

Openness in the NHS
The Code of Practice on Openness in the
NHS is designed to make NHS organisations
more accountable and provide greater public
access to information. The Code applies to
NHS Trusts, health authorities/health boards
and local health practitioners such as GPs,
dentists and pharmacists. It sets out the
information that NHS Trusts and health
authorities/health boards should publish or
otherwise make available.
The NHS Code contains, among other
things:
• information about what services are
provided, the targets and standards set
and results achieved, and the costs and
effectiveness of the service;
• details of important proposals on health
policies or proposed changes in the way
the services are delivered; and
• information about how people can have
access to their own personal health
records.
NHS Complaints System
Complaints about all NHS-funded services
are dealt with at two distinct levels. The
procedures aim to resolve complaints speedily
at a local level; where complainants are
dissatisfied with the response at local level, a
new system of review by an independent panel
is an option. Patients can refer complaints to
the Health Service Commissioner if they are
dissatisfied with the response from the NHS.
Health Service Commissioners
Health Service Commissioners (one each for
England, Scotland and Wales) are responsible
for investigating complaints directly from
194
HEALTH SERVICES
members of the public about health service
bodies. The three posts are at present held by
one person (with a staff of about 250), who is
also Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman—see p. 50). As
Health Service Commissioner, he reports
annually to Parliament. In Northern Ireland
the Commissioner for Complaints has a
similar role.
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered hardship as a result of:
• a failure in a service provided by a health
service body;
• a failure to provide a service which the
patient was entitled to receive; or
• maladministration by an NHS authority—
that is, something that the NHS authority
failed to do or did in the wrong way.
Complaints must be sent to the
Commissioner in writing, and the health
service body concerned should first have been
given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
In 1997-98 the Commissioner received
2,660 complaints about the NHS—20% more
than the previous year. He completed 120
investigations.
Patient’s Charters
Patient’s Charters set out the rights of patients
and the standards of service they can expect to
receive from the NHS. The responsibility for
implementing the Patient’s Charters rests with
all parts of the NHS.
The original Patient’s Charter in England
came into force in 1992 and an expanded
version was issued in 1995, covering dental,
optical and pharmaceutical services and the
hospital environment. The Patient’s Charter
sets national standards, which are not legal
rights but specific standards of service that the
NHS aims to provide. These cover respect for
the individual patient; waiting times for
ambulances, clinical assessment in Accident
and Emergency departments and
appointments in out-patient clinics; and
cancellation of operations. Separate but
similar Patient’s Charters have been developed
for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
All health authorities in England and Wales
and health boards and NHS Trusts in
Scotland have also produced local charters,
with statements of the standards of service
patients can expect to receive. GP practices
are encouraged to produce their own charters,
setting out the standards of service they offer
their patients.
Planned Changes
The Government sees the existing Charter as
simplistic, concentrating too much on the
easily measurable. It considers that it fails to
give proper weight to the quality of clinical
care and patients’ own experiences of how well
the service has been delivered. The existing
Patient’s Charter will be replaced in 1998 with
a new NHS Charter, which will concentrate
on the quality and success of treatment, and
aim to provide a better balance between the
rights of patients and their responsibilities
towards the NHS.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The Family Health Services are those given to
patients by doctors (GPs), dentists, opticians
and pharmacists of their own choice. They
remain the first point of contact most people
have with the NHS. In England there are over
270 million consultations with GPs each year.
Often those who visit their GP or dentist need
no clinical treatment but healthy lifestyle
counselling and preventive healthcare advice
instead. The last decade has seen continued
growth of the Family Health Services in line
with long-standing government policy to build
up and extend these services in order to
improve health and relieve pressure on the far
more costly secondary care sector (that is,
hospital and specialist services).
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case
of illness, give advice and may prescribe a
suitable course of treatment or refer a patient
to the more specialised services and hospital
consultants. Most GPs in the UK work in
partnerships or group practices. Primary
healthcare teams also include health visitors
and district nurses, midwives, and sometimes
social workers and other professional staff
195
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
employed by the health authorities. Most GPs
in Great Britain and about half in Northern
Ireland work in health centres. As well as
providing medical and nursing services, health
centres may have facilities for health
education, family planning, speech therapy,
chiropody, assessment of hearing,
physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental,
pharmaceutical and ophthalmic services,
hospital out-patient and supporting social
work services may also be provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary healthcare staff in recent years. For
example, between 1987 and 1997 the number of
GPs in England rose steadily at a rate of 0.8%,
with women accounting for all of this increase.
Doctors had on average about 7% fewer
patients on their lists in 1997 than in 1987.
Similarly, the number of general dental
practitioners continues to grow (rising to
16,336 in 1997—an increase of 12.5% over
1987). The average number of courses of
treatment for each dentist has fallen marginally.
New Initiatives in Primary Care
In recent years GPs have gained powers on
behalf of their patients in a changed
relationship with consultants. The
Government acknowledges that the GP
fundholding schemes have produced benefits
in terms of improved patient care and is keen
to work in partnership with them to build
better services. It intends to retain the lead
role for primary care but remove the
disadvantages that have come from the present
system (see p. 189). The NHS (Primary Care)
Act 1997 is designed to allow flexibility in the
delivery of primary healthcare services for
patients. It enables GPs, dentists, NHS
Trusts and NHS employees to work with
health authorities and health boards to develop
new ways of delivering primary care under
local contracts.
General Medical Services Pilot Schemes
A number of pilot schemes to pioneer new
ways of providing patient care in general
practice have been running since April 1998.
Examples include:
• A Primary Care Practice in Isleworth,
West London, in one of the more
deprived parts of the country, is
employing one GP, and provides a wide
range of health services from counselling
to speech therapy, physiotherapy to
dentistry, and social security benefits
advice to social worker support. The new
centre brings together the skills of
primary, community health and social
services staff under one roof, with the
aim of improving health and meeting the
diverse needs of the local community.
• A pilot scheme in Chertsey, West Surrey,
involves two GP partnerships currently
working from the same health centre
entering into a single service contract
with the health authority. The scheme is
developing a number of changes
including extending the role of doctors
and nurses to establish one-stop clinics;
diverting administrative resources into
patient care; improving communications
with community nursing services; and
developing local service guidelines for
chronic disease management.
Dental Services
In 1997 the Government launched its
Investing in Dentistry scheme in England, to
help improve dental care in areas of poor
availability and poor oral health. Similar
schemes are in operation in Scotland and
Wales. Help includes grants to dentists to help
expand or set up new practices in return for
long-term commitment to the NHS, and
support for newly qualified dentists and
women returning from a career break. Up to
£19 million has been made available between
1997_98 and 1998-99. The Government is to
introduce a new strategy for NHS dentistry
during 1998.
Community Pharmacists
The Government is to publish proposals later
in 1998 for developing the role of community
pharmacists within the NHS to make better
use of their skills. Current pilot projects
involve repeat and instalment dispensing,

which has the potential to improve monitoring
of treatment and reduce GP paperwork and
drug waste; and schemes where pharmacists
provide support for patients with medication-
related problems, such as complex regimes or
difficulties in taking medication effectively.
Midwives, Health Visitors and District
Nurses
Midwives provide care and support to women
throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal
period (up to 28 days after the baby is born).
Midwives work in both hospital and
community settings.
Health visitors are responsible for the
preventive care and health promotion of
families, particularly those with young
children. They identify local health needs and
work closely with GPs, district nurses and
other professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere
outside hospital; they also play an important
role in health promotion and education.
Since April 1998, district nurses and health
visitors, based in GP practices, have been able
to prescribe from a limited list of drugs and
medical appliances. This is intended to reduce
significantly the time patients have to wait for
relief of their symptoms.
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
District general hospitals offer a broad range
of clinical specialities, supported by a range of
other services such as anaesthetics, pathology
and radiology. Almost all have facilities for the
admission of emergency patients, either
through Accident and Emergency
departments or as direct referrals from GPs.
Treatments are provided for in-patients, day
cases, out-patients and patients who attend
wards for treatment such as dialysis. Some
hospitals also provide specialist services which
cover more than one region or district. These
are known in England as supra-regional or
supra-district services covering, for example,
heart and liver transplants, craniofacial
services, and rare eye and bone cancers. (In
Scotland similar services are contracted for
centrally.) There are also specialist hospitals
such as the world-famous Hospital for Sick
Children at Great Ormond Street, Moorfields
Eye Hospital, and the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery, all in London.
These hospitals combine specialist treatment
facilities with the training of medical and other
students, and international research.
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were
built in the 19th century; some trace their
origins to much earlier charitable foundations.
Much has been done to improve and extend
existing hospital buildings and many new
hospitals have been or are being opened.
Recent policy has been to provide a balanced
hospital service centred around a district
general hospital, complemented as necessary
by smaller, locally based hospitals and
facilities.
Greater Accountability for NHS Trusts
Each NHS Trust (see p. 190) is run by a board
of executive and non-executive directors.
Trusts are free to employ their own staff and
set their own rates of pay, although staff
transferring to Trust employment retain their
existing terms and conditions of service.
Trusts are also free to carry out research and
provide facilities for medical education and
other forms of training. They may treat
private patients to generate income provided
this does not interfere with NHS obligations.
Since February 1998 all Trust board
meetings must be open to the public.
Measures have also been taken to make boards
more representative of the local communities
they serve, by ensuring that appointments
procedures include representatives of ordinary
NHS users, patients and carers.
Waiting lists
Half of all admissions to hospital are
immediate. The other half have a waiting-time
before the admission takes place. Of patients
admitted from waiting lists, half are admitted
within six weeks, and around two-thirds
within three months.
At the time of the General Election in May
1997 there were increasing numbers of
patients waiting for admission to hospital and

lengthening inpatient and outpatient waiting
times. In November 1997, the Government
announced a plan for reducing NHS waiting
lists and times, and has stated that by the end
of the present Parliament, NHS waiting lists
will be 100,000 shorter than the record 1.1
million figure of May 1997.
In England the plan includes:
• extra funding specifically targeted on
reducing waiting lists;
• waiting list targets set in every NHS
region for the coming year, the national
target being that by April 1999 waiting
lists will at least be shorter than the 1.1
million figure of May 1997;
• a performance fund to reward health
authorities who are on target to cut their
waiting lists by the agreed amounts; and
• a new national team to help the NHS to
meet the targets. This has approved a
number of projects to pilot ways of
tackling waiting lists.
Schemes being introduced by health
authorities include increasing the numbers of
beds, wards and staff; extending theatre times
and treatments; and introducing weekend and
evening surgery.
Similar action is under way in Scotland.
Additional funding has been provided and a
performance fund is available to reward NHS
Trusts which achieve prompt reductions in
waiting lists and waiting times through
effective management and/or strategic or
innovative actions. A high level support force
has been established to help secure long-term,
sustained reductions. A number of projects
designed to meet this objective are now in
progress, including one-stop, and nurse-led,
clinics.
Private Finance Initiative
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was
launched in 1992 to promote partnership
between the public and private sectors on a
commercial basis (see chapter 23). In the
health service it involves the use of private
finance in NHS capital projects for the design,
construction and operation of buildings and
support services. The Government introduced
legislation in 1997 to reinvigorate the system
by clarifying powers of NHS Trusts to sign
PFI agreements, and, following a review of
PFI hospital building schemes in England,
announced a major new hospital building
programme. Under this, 25 major hospital
schemes in England—with a capital value of
198
HEALTH SERVICES
around £2,200 million—have been approved
to proceed. Eleven major PFI schemes in
Scotland worth £408 million are also
proceeding. The hospitals will be designed,
built, maintained and owned by the private
sector, which will lease the completed facilities
back to the NHS. Clinical services will
continue to be provided by NHS staff, and the
NHS will remain in control of the key
planning and clinical decisions.
Mobile Intensive Care for Children
In July 1997 the Government announced
plans to improve paediatric intensive care
(PIC) services in England. These include the
development of a 24-hour retrieval service, to
ensure that critically ill children needing
transfer to a PIC unit are accompanied by
doctors and nurses trained in paediatric
intensive care. The Government has provided
funding of £5 million for 1997-98 to assist in
improving PIC services in England.
Organ Transplantation
The United Kingdom Transplant Support
Service Authority (a Special Health Authority
of the NHS), provides a 24-hour support
service to all transplant units in the UK for
the matching and allocation of organs for
transplant. During 1997, 1,692 kidney
transplants were performed. A similar service
exists for corneas and, in 1997, over 2,300
were transplanted.
There are seven designated thoracic
transplant centres in England, and one in
Scotland. In 1997, 266 heart, 103 lung, and 44
heart/lung transplants were performed. There
are six designated liver transplant units in
England and one in Scotland. In 1997, 670
liver transplants were performed. The world’s
first combined heart, lungs and liver
transplant operation was carried out at
Addenbrooke’s Hospital in 1986.
A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their willingness to
become organ donors in the event of their
death. The NHS Organ Donor Register is a
computer database of those willing to be organ
donors. By June 1998 it contained 4.8 million
names. Commercial dealing in organs for
transplantation is illegal in the UK.
Blood Transfusion Services
Blood transfusion services are run by the
National Blood Authority in England, the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service,
the Welsh Blood Service and the Northern
Ireland Blood Transfusion Agency. The UK
is self-sufficient in blood and blood products.
In England alone around 2.4 million
donations are given each year by voluntary
unpaid donors and separated into many
different life-saving products for patients. Red
cells, platelets and other products with a
limited ‘shelf life’ are prepared at blood
centres. The production of plasma products is
undertaken at the Bio Products Laboratory in
Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the Protein
Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the four national bodies co¬
ordinates programmes for donor recruitment,
retention and education, and donor sessions
are organised regionally, in towns, villages and
workplaces. Donors are normally aged
between 17 and 70. Blood centres are
responsible for blood collection, screening,
processing and supplying hospital blood
banks. They also provide wide-ranging
laboratory, clinical, research, teaching and
advisory services and facilities. These are
subject to nationally co-ordinated quality
audit programmes.
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free
for cases of sudden illness or collapse, for
accidents and for doctors’ urgent calls. Rapid
response services, in which paramedics use
cars and motorcycles to reach emergency
cases, have been introduced in a number of
areas, particularly London and other major
cities with areas of high traffic density.
Helicopter ambulances serve many parts of
the country and an integrated air ambulance
service is available throughout Scotland.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are free to NHS patients considered by their
199
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
doctor (or dentist or midwife) to be medically
unfit to travel by other means. In many areas
the ambulance service organises volunteer
drivers to provide a hospital car service for non¬
urgent patients. Patients on low incomes may
be eligible for reimbursement of costs of
travelling to hospital.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation services are available for elderly,
young, and mentally ill people, and for those
with physical or learning disabilities who need
such help to resume life in the community.
These services are offered in hospitals, centres
in the community and in people’s own homes
through co-ordinated work by a range of
professionals.
Medical services may provide free artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports,
wheelchairs, and other appliances. Following
assessment, very severely physically disabled
patients may be provided with environmental
control equipment which enables them to
operate devices such as alarm bells, radios and
televisions, telephones, and heating appliances.
Nursing equipment may be provided on loan
for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of
facilities to help patients in the transition from
hospital to their own homes, including the
provision of equipment; help with cleaning,
shopping and cooking; care from domestic
help workers; and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers.
Voluntary organisations also provide services,
complementing the work of the statutory
agencies.
Hospices
Hospice or palliative care is a special type of
care for people whose illness may no longer be
curable; it enables them to achieve the best
possible quality of life during the final stages.
The care may be provided in a variety of
settings: at home (with support from specially
trained staff), in a hospice or palliative care
unit, in hospital or at a hospice day centre.
Hospice or palliative care focuses on
controlling pain and other distressing
symptoms and providing psychological support
to patients, their families and friends, both
during the patient’s illness and into
bereavement.
Palliative care was first developed in the UK
in 1967 by the voluntary hospices and continues
to be provided by them in many areas, but is
now also provided within NHS palliative care
units, hospitals and community services.
Hospices and palliative care services mostly
help people with cancer, although patients with
other life-threatening illnesses are also cared
for. There are also several hospices providing
respite care for children from birth to 16 years
of age.
The National Council for Hospices and
Specialist Palliative Care Services is an umbrella
organisation which brings together both
voluntary and health service providers in order
to provide a co-ordinated view of the service; it
covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Its
Scottish counterpart is the Scottish Partnership
Agency for Palliative and Cancer Care.
Private Medical Treatment
Some NHS hospitals share expensive
equipment with private hospitals, and NHS
patients are sometimes treated (at public
expense) in the private sector where it
represents value for money. The scale of
private practice in relation to the NHS is,
however, relatively small.
It has been estimated that about three-
quarters of those receiving acute treatment in
private hospitals or NHS hospital pay beds are
funded by health insurance schemes, which
make provision for private healthcare in return
for annual subscriptions. According to the
Consumers’ Association, 12.7% of people in
the UK subscribe to such schemes compared
with fewer than 2% in the 1950s. Around 60%
of these are covered by group schemes, some
arranged by firms on behalf of employees.
Many overseas patients come to the UK for
treatment in private hospitals and clinics.
Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.

Services include free dental treatment; health
education; and vaccination and immunisation
of children against certain infectious diseases
(see p. 205).
A woman is entitled to care throughout her
pregnancy, the birth and the postnatal period.
Care may be provided by a midwife, a
community-based GP, a hospital-based
obstetrician, or a combination of these. The
birth may take place in a hospital maternity
unit, a midwife/GP-led unit, or at home.
After the birth, a midwife will visit until the
baby is at least ten days old and after that a
health visitor’s services are available.
Throughout her pregnancy and for the first
year of her baby’s life, a woman is entitled to
free prescriptions and dental care.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance is provided for pre-school
children in clinics run by the community
health trusts, and increasingly by GPs. This
enables doctors, dentists and health visitors to
oversee the physical and mental health and
development of pre-school children.
Information on preventive services is given
and in some clinics welfare foods are
distributed. The school health service offers
healthcare and advice for schoolchildren,
including medical and dental inspection and
treatment where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or emotional
problems. In recent years special efforts have
been made to improve co-operation between
the community-based child health services
and local authority education and social
services for children. This is particularly
important in the prevention of child abuse and
for the health and welfare of children in care
(see p. 169).
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
the UK in 1978, as a result of the technique of
in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of infertility
and for the science of embryology. The social,
ethical and legal implications were examined by
a committee of inquiry under Baroness
Warnock (1984) and led eventually to the
passage of the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990, one of the most
comprehensive pieces of legislation on assisted
reproduction and embryo research in the world.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA) licenses and controls
centres providing certain infertility
treatments, undertaking human embryo
research or storing gametes or embryos. The
HFEA maintains a code of practice giving
guidance to licensed centres and reports
annually to Parliament.
The law prohibits surrogacy arrangements
made on a commercial basis and prohibits any
advertising concerning surrogacy. An
independent review of aspects of surrogacy
law was set up in 1997. Its terms of reference
are to consider whether payments, including
expenses, to surrogate mothers should
continue to be allowed and, if so, on what
basis; to examine whether there is a case for
regulating surrogacy arrangements through a
recognised body; and, in the light of the
above, to advise whether changes are needed
to the present legislation.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Ethical Issues
The Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing
was set up in 1996 to consider the ethical,
social and scientific aspects of genetic testing.
In 1997 it published a code of practice on
genetic testing supplied to the public. The
Human Genetic Advisory Commission, which
met for the first time in 1997, takes a broad
view of developments in human genetics and
aims to foster public confidence in its
application.
Family Planning
The Government’s public health strategy aims
to ensure the provision of effective family
planning services. Free family planning advice
and treatment is available from GPs or from
family planning clinics. Clinics are also able to
provide condoms and other contraceptives
free of charge. The Department of Health is
working closely with the Government’s Social
Exclusion Unit (see p. 115) to develop a
strategy on teenage pregnancy.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, a time limit of
24 weeks applies to the largest category of
abortion—risk to the physical or mental health
of the pregnant woman—and also to abortion
because of a similar risk to any existing
children of her family. There are three
categories in which no time limit applies: to
prevent grave permanent injury to the
physical or mental health of the woman; where
there is a substantial risk of serious foetal
handicap; or where continuing the pregnancy
would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant
woman greater than if the pregnancy were
terminated. The Act does not apply in
Northern Ireland.
Between 1996 and 1997:
• the number of legal abortions in England
and Wales increased by 1.3% to 179,590
(in Scotland by 0.8% to 12,080);
• abortions on women resident in England
and Wales increased by 1.4% to 170,005;
• abortions carried out under the NHS
increased by 2,073 (1.7%), while non-
NHS abortions increased by 22 (0.04%)
and abortions on non-resident women
rose to 9,585, an increase of 0.1%. These
abortions represented 5.3% of all
abortions carried out in England and
Wales; and
• the overall abortion rate for women
resident in England and Wales was 13.2
abortions for every 1,000 women aged 14
to 49, an increase of 1.2% compared with
1996. In Scotland, the figures were 11
abortions for every 1,000 women aged 15
to 44, an increase of 0.01% compared
with 1996.
Substance Misuse
Drug Misuse
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines, is a serious social and
health problem, and the Government is
making the fight against such misuse a
priority. It has reviewed current anti-drugs
work and has drawn up a new drugs strategy
for the UK. (See chapter 14 for details,
including the work of Drug Action Teams.)
The health departments are contributing to
the new strategy through their responsibilities
for treatment, policy and publicising public
health messages on prevention and reducing
harm. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
have their own distinctive strategies; these too
have been under review.
Research on various aspects of drug misuse
is funded by several government departments.
The Government is advised on matters
relating to drug misuse and connected social
problems by the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs (in Scotland the Scottish
Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse).
Prevention
As part of the Government’s anti-drugs
strategy (see p. 217), a new Drugs Prevention
Advisory Service is being set up from April
1999. This will replace the Home Office
Drugs Prevention Initiative which, since 1990,
has been piloting different approaches to
community-based drugs prevention in many
areas. The Initiative has provided funding for
202
HEALTH SERVICES
In a wide-ranging review of drug
strategies, the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs says that drug misuse
cannot be tackled without linked
employment, education, housing and
crime prevention measures. Its proposals
for action cover all areas of daily life—
from schools and nightclubs, to home and
the workplace—to get to grips with the
complex social problems linked to misuse.
This new approach considers that drug
problems do not exist in isolation from
other factors, and that broader issues such
as social deprivation and attitudes to legal
drugs such as alcohol and tobacco must
form part of drug prevention strategies
which place responsibility on society as
well as on the individual.
local drugs prevention teams in 12 areas in
England. The teams aim to show what local
communities working together can do to tackle
problems associated with drugs misuse. The
1998-99 budget for the Initiative is some £2
million. At present over 70 local projects are
being implemented. They are aimed at young
people (including some projects within the
criminal justice system designed to confront
the links between drugs and crime); at parents;
and at whole communities. The Initiative has
been underpinned by an extensive programme
of research, and the findings will be published
during 1999.
The new Drugs Prevention Advisory
Service will work with all Drug Action Teams
in England to encourage good drugs
prevention practice, based on available
evidence, and to assist in developing
appropriate demonstration programmes to
help spread knowledge about what works in
this area. There will be nine regional teams,
covering the whole of England.
The Government makes funds available
through local education authorities in England
and Wales to provide in-service training for
teachers involved in drug-prevention work in
schools. As part of the National Curriculum in
England and Wales (see chapter 10), children
in primary and secondary schools receive
education on the dangers of drug misuse.
In Scotland, education authorities are
encouraged to address health education
including drug education within a
comprehensive programme of personal and
social education.
Government national mass media publicity
campaigns have been run since 1985 to
persuade young people not to take drugs, and
to advise parents, teachers and other
professionals on how to recognise and combat
the problem.
UK National Drugs Helpline
A national drugs and solvents telephone
helpline provides 24-hour free confidential
advice, counselling and information
throughout the UK to anyone concerned
about the health implications of drugs or
solvent misuse. The telephone number is
0800 77 66 00.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
Treatment for drug dependence includes:
residential detoxification and rehabilitation;
community drug dependency services; needle
and syringe exchange schemes to combat the
spread of HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne
infections; advice and counselling; and after¬
care and support services. An increasing
number of GPs treat drug misusers, but only a
limited number of doctors are licensed to
prescribe certain controlled drugs to them,
such as heroin and cocaine. However, any
doctor may prescribe methadone as a
substitute drug for drug misusers. All doctors
must notify the authorities of any patient they
consider to be addicted to certain controlled
drugs.
A number of non-statutory agencies work
with, and complement, health service
provision. Advice and rehabilitation services,
including residential facilities, for example, are
provided by many voluntary organisations.
The total amount available to health
authorities in England for drug treatment
services in 1998-99 is over £42 million. In
addition, a grant is payable each year to local
authorities to enable them to support

HIV/AIDS services.
Solvent Misuse
Government policy aims to prevent solvent
misuse through educating young people,
parents and professionals about the dangers
and signs of misuse, and, where practicable,
restricting the sales of solvent-based liquefied
gas and aerosol products to young people.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it
is an offence to supply such substances to
children under 18 if the supplier knows or has
reason to believe they are to be used to induce
intoxication. In Scotland proceedings can be
taken under the common law.
The Department of Health funds a
hospital-based unit in London to collect and
publish annual mortality statistics associated
with solvent misuse. The statistics for 1996
show the number of deaths having risen to 75,
compared with 69 deaths in 1995.
Alcohol Misuse
Alcohol is consumed by over 90% of the adult
population. In 1994, 27% of men and 13% of
women in England and Wales (24% of men
and 9% of women in Scotland) were drinking
above the then recommended sensible limits
(21 units a week for men and 14 units for
women). In England alone, this is the
equivalent of around 9 million adults. Between
8.8 and 14.8 million working days each year
are lost through alcohol-related absence. The
most widely accepted estimate of the cost of
alcohol misuse in England and Wales is
£2,700 million a year.
The Government seeks to tackle alcohol-
related problems through a co-ordinated
programme of action across government
departments, and involving health and local
authorities, the independent sector, employers
and the alcohol industry.
Part of the funds allocated to the Health
Education Authority (see p. 206) are for
promoting the sensible drinking message in
England, and equivalent bodies are similarly
funded in other parts of the UK. In Scotland,
pilot projects have been launched at local level
to tackle underage drinking.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the
NHS include in-patient and out-patient
services in general and psychiatric hospitals
and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (GPs, community
psychiatric nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing treatment
and rehabilitation in hostels, day centres and
advisory services also play an important role.
The development of services to help
problem drinkers and their families is being
taken forward within the framework of
community care. Local authorities are
required to identify the need for alcohol
misuse services in their area, and to list the
services provided in their community care
plans (see p. 165). They are then responsible
for arranging for the needs of individuals with
alcohol problems to be assessed, and for
buying an appropriate course of care.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. In
England the voluntary agency Alcohol
Concern plays a prominent role in improving
services for problem drinkers and their
families; increasing public awareness of
alcohol misuse and harm-free drinking; and
improving training for professional and
voluntary workers. The Scottish Council on
Alcohol undertakes similar work in Scotland.
Research and surveys on various aspects of
alcohol misuse are funded by several
government departments.
The Government is preparing a new
strategy on alcohol.
Communicable Diseases
Health authorities/health boards have a key
responsibility for prevention and control of
outbreaks of infectious disease, liaising closely
with colleagues in environmental health
departments of local authorities. They are
assisted by the Public Health Laboratory
Service, which aims to protect the population
from infection through the detection,
diagnosis, surveillance, prevention and control
of communicable diseases in England and
Wales. Similar facilities are provided in
204
HEALTH SERVICES
Scotland by the Scottish Centre for Infection
and Environmental Health and, in Northern
Ireland, by the Department of Health and
Social Services, the Northern Ireland Public
Health Laboratory and other hospital
microbiology laboratories.
Immunisation
Health authorities/health boards carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis, whooping
cough and haemophilus influenzae type B
infection (‘Hib’). Immunisation is voluntary,
but parents are encouraged to protect their
children. GPs who achieve targets of 70% and
90% uptake of child immunisation receive
special payments.
Annual immunisation rates are now at their
highest ever levels—for example, the uptake of
diphtheria, tetanus and polio immunisation by
the age of two in 1996-97 was 96%. The
incidence of such childhood diseases is at its
lowest ever level. Since the introduction of the
Hib vaccine in 1992, Hib meningitis has been
almost completely eliminated in young children.
AIDS
Up to the end of June 1998 a total of 15,565
cases of AIDS had been reported in the UK,
of whom 10,522 (68%) were homosexual or
bisexual males. The total number of
recognised HIV infections was 32,242, of
whom 26,957 (84%) were male. The
majority—19,348 (60%)—were homosexual
or bisexual males, but 6,665 (21%) were non¬
drug-using heterosexuals.
HIV infection is found throughout England
and Wales among those groups at greatest risk,
but rates are much higher in London than
elsewhere. Transmission is still occurring in
some homosexual/bisexual men, and injecting
drug users are still taking part in high-risk
behaviour, with younger users and women in
particular sharing injecting equipment.
Prevalence in pregnant women in London has
remained relatively high at one in 556.
Key elements of the Government’s
HIV/AIDS strategy include:
• encouraging appropriate behaviour
change by increased targeting of sections
of the population at particular risk,
including homosexual and bisexual men
and drug misusers;
• sustaining and improving general public
awareness;
• continuing to make HIV testing facilities
more widely known, and encouraging
health authorities to commission
additional accessible HIV testing sites;
and
• continued funding for the voluntary
sector.
A concerted approach is being maintained,
spanning government, the NHS, local
authorities and the voluntary sector (including
women’s groups, religious communities and
organisations working with ethnic minorities).
In England NHS funding for HIV/AIDS
treatment and care to health authorities
amounted to £228.4 million in 1998-99. In
Scotland £9.9 million has been made available
to health boards for HIV/AIDS treatment and
care in 1998-99.
Voluntary agencies concerned with
HIV/AIDS include the Terrence Higgins
Trust, London Lighthouse, Body Positive and
the National AIDS Trust. Both London
Lighthouse and the Mildmay Mission
Hospital, in London, provide hospice care and
community support. The Government
distributes grants on a yearly basis, taking into
account developing health priorities and the
ability of voluntary bodies to raise funds from
other sources.
TB
The worldwide resurgence of TB
(tuberculosis) in recent years is having a small
but important impact on trends in the UK.
The provisional figure for notifications of TB
in 1997 was 6,430 compared with 5,745 in
1987. Data suggest that certain parts of the
community—older white people who were
exposed to TB when they were younger,
homeless people, those infected with HIV, and
certain ethnic minority populations—are at an
increased risk from TB. The disease remains a
public health concern, especially for inner city
205
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
health authorities (the Inner London boroughs
alone account for nearly 40% of notified cases
in England). One half of cases in England are
in the non-white ethnic population from areas
of the world with a high prevalence of TB. A
detailed survey of notifications is in progress
and is expected to provide important
information on trends and incidence.
Cancer Care
Care and treatment of cancer forms an
enormous part of the NHS’s work, consuming
nearly 7% of its total budget. A framework for
the future development of cancer services (the
Calman-Hine Report) was announced in 1995.
This recommended that services should be
organised at three levels, with primary care
seen as the initial focus of care; cancer units
created in many local hospitals of a sufficient
size to support a multidisciplinary team with
the expertise and facilities to treat commoner
cancers; and cancer centres situated in larger
hospitals to treat less common cancers and to
support smaller cancer units by providing
services not available in all local hospitals.
Health authorities/health boards are now
planning to implement the changes
recommended.
The Government is committed to
improving the provision and availability of
high-quality cancer services and is directing
savings achieved from cuts in the cost of the
NHS internal market (see p. 188) into patient
care. As a first step, £10 million was made
available in 1997 for breast cancer services to
speed up access to diagnosis, reduce waiting
times for treatment and support networks of
specialist breast cancer teams. By 2000
everyone with suspected cancer will be able to
see a specialist within two weeks of their GP’s
deciding they need to be seen urgently, and
requesting an appointment. By April 1999
these arrangements will be guaranteed for
everyone with suspected breast cancer.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer is recognised as a major health
problem in the UK: some 14,000 women die
from it each year; and 1 in 12 women will
develop it. The UK was the first country in
the European Union to introduce a nationwide
breast screening programme, under which
women aged between 50 and 64 are invited for
mammography (breast X-ray) every three
years by computerised call and recall systems.
In 1996-97:
• 75% of women in England (72% in
Scotland) aged 50 to 64 invited for
screening were screened;
• 1.1 million women of all ages in England
were screened within the programme;
• 6,160 cases of cancer were diagnosed
among women screened in England.
The nationwide cervical screening
programme aims to reduce death from cancer
of the cervix by inviting women aged between
20 and 64 (20 and 60 in Scotland) to take a free
smear test at least every five years. Health
authorities must ensure that the results of a
smear test are returned from the laboratory to
the patient within a month.
Special payments are made to GPs who
achieve targets of 50% and 80% for the uptake
of smear tests. The Government estimates that
almost all GPs now earn bonus payments for
meeting cervical screening targets. In Scotland
over 85% of women invited to attend have been
screened over the last five years.
Deaths from cervical cancer in England and
Wales have fallen since the programme began,
dropping from 1,942 in 1988 to 1,222 in 1997,
and in Scotland from 191 in 1988 to 144 in 1997.
Health Education
Responsibility for health education in the UK
lies with four separate health education
authorities, which work alongside the national
health departments. All four authorities are
part of the NHS. They are the Health
Education Authority; Health Promotion
Wales; the Health Education Board for
Scotland; and the Health Promotion Agency
for Northern Ireland. Their aims are:
• to provide information and advice about
health directly to members of the public;
• to support other organisations and health
professionals who provide health
education to members of the public; and
206
HEALTH SERVICES
• to advise the Government on health
education.
In addition, the Health Education
Authority has the major executive
responsibility for public education in the UK
about AIDS. It also helps in the provision of
training for HIV/AIDS workers, and provides
a national centre of information and advice on
health education. Major campaigns carried out
by the health education authorities include
those focusing on coronary heart disease,
cancer, smoking and alcohol misuse.
Almost all NHS health authorities/health
boards have their own health education
service, which works closely with health
professionals, health visitors, community
groups, local employers and others to
determine the most suitable local programmes.
Increased resources in the health service are
being directed towards health education and
preventive measures. GPs receive special
payments for health promotion programmes.
Nutrition
Despite the growing public awareness in
recent years of the importance of a healthy
diet, the proportion of adults who are obese or
overweight has increased. In 1996, 17% of
women and 16% of men aged 16-64 in
England were classified as obese, compared
with 8% and 6% respectively in 1980 in Great
Britain. The likelihood of obesity is higher in
manual than in non-manual social classes for
both men and women.
Medical research has shown that a diet
which is low in fats, especially saturates, and
rich in fruits, vegetables and starchy foods
contributes to good health and can reduce the
risk of certain serious illnesses, such as
coronary heart disease and stroke.
The latest report of the Committee on the
Medical Aspects of Food and Nutritional
Policy—The Nutritional Aspects of the
Development of Cancer—was published in
March 1998. It contains recommendations on
diet and nutrition to help reduce risk of
cancers. Research suggests that diet could
contribute to a third of all cancers. Its
recommendations are being considered by the
Government. The Scottish Diet Action Plan,
published in 1996, sets a framework for
improving diet in Scotland through a multi¬
sectoral approach.
The major supermarket chains and most
food manufacturers have introduced voluntary
labelling schemes indicating the energy, fat,
protein and carbohydrate content of food.
Nutrition labelling is compulsory on products
for which a nutritional claim is made.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health provides public health
protection through control of: physical
environment; atmospheric pollution and noise;
contaminated land, food and water; unfit
housing; health and safety; communicable
diseases; and statutory nuisances. In the UK no
single government department is responsible for
environmental health as a whole, although the
Department of Health advises other government
departments on the health implications of their
policies. Environmental health services are
provided by local government.
Professionally trained environmental health
officers are employed principally by local
authority councils. They are concerned with
inspection, health education and regulation.
The Institute for Environment and Health,
established by the Medical Research Council,
is concerned mainly with research and
management of research into the hazards to
which people may be exposed through the
environment. In Scotland the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health
provides surveillance and advisory services on
environmental health matters.
The Department of Health, Welsh Office
and Scottish Office have established National
Focus, a unit based in Cardiff, to co-ordinate
work on response to chemical incidents and
surveillance of health effects of environmental
chemicals. A major research programme to
find out more about the health effects of
chemical pollutants in the environment was
announced in January 1998, funded jointly by
the Department of Health and the DETR.
Safety of Food
Under the Food Safety Act 1990, it is illegal to
sell or supply food that is unfit for human
207
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
consumption or falsely or misleadingly
labelled. The Act covers a broad range of
commercial activities related to food
production, to the sources from which it is
derived, such as crops and animals, and to
articles which come into contact with food.
There are also more detailed regulations
which apply to all types of food and drink and
their ingredients. Local authorities are
responsible for enforcing food law in two main
areas: Trading Standards Officers deal with
the labelling of food, its composition and most
cases of chemical contamination;
Environmental Health Officers deal with
hygiene, with cases of microbiological
contamination of foods, and any food which
for any reason is unfit for human
consumption. See chapter 27 for proposals for
a new independent Food Standards Agency.
CJD and Public Health
In 1996 the Government announced the
identification of a new variant of CJD
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), an extremely rare
spongiform encephalopathy in humans. The
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee (SEAC) concluded that the most
likely explanation, in the absence of any
credible alternative, is that these cases are
linked to exposure to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) before the introduction of the
ban on specified bovine offals in 1989.
While there remains no unequivocal
scientific evidence that CJD is linked to BSE,
the Government is providing additional
funding for research into CJD and BSE,
including the work carried out at the national
CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, which
monitors the incidence of the disease. (See
chapter 27 for details of government measures
to control the spread of BSE.)
SAFETY OF MEDICINES
Only medicines that have been granted a
marketing authorisation issued by the
European Medicines Evaluation Agency
(EMEA) or the Medicines Control Agency
(MCA) may be sold or supplied to the public.
Marketing authorisations are issued following
scientific assessment on the basis of safety,
quality and efficacy.
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists in
the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for undergraduate
teaching; the NHS provides hospital and
community facilities for training. Full
registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school and
hospital, and the community, with a further
year’s experience in a hospital. For a dentist,
five years’ training at a dental school is
required.
Following a review of specialist medical
training, the Government considers that the
introduction of a new specialist registrar
grade, which reduces from three to two the
number of specialist training grades, will
increasingly allow doctors to complete their
training at an earlier age. This change,
together with other policies to increase
consultant numbers and reduce junior
doctors’ hours, are expected to increase the
amount of service provided to NHS patients
by consultants.
The regulating body for the medical
profession is the General Medical Council
and, for dentists, the General Dental Council.
The main professional associations are the
British Medical Association and the British
Dental Association.
Nurses, Mid wives and Health Visitors
Nursing students undertake the pre¬
registration Diploma in Higher Education
(Project 2000) programme, which emphasises
health promotion as well as care of the sick
and enables students to work either in
hospitals or in the community. The
programme lasts three years and consists of
periods of college study combined with
practical experience in hospital and in the
community.
Midwifery education programmes for
registered general/adult nurses take 18
208
HEALTH SERVICES
months, but the direct entry programme lasts
three years. Health visitors are registered adult
nurses who have a further specialist
qualification in health visiting. District nurses
are registered adult nurses who have a further
specialist qualification in district nursing and
care for clients in the community.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions. Four National Boards—for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland—are responsible for ensuring that the
education and training policies of the Council
are carried out. The main professional
associations are the Royal College of Nursing,
the Royal College of Midwives and the
Community Practitioners and Health Visitors
Association.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists.
Registration requires four years’ training in a
school of pharmacy, followed by one year’s
practical experience in a community or
hospital pharmacy approved for training by
the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain or the Pharmaceutical Society of
Northern Ireland (regulatory bodies for the
profession).
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight; training for the former takes four years,
including a year of practical experience under
supervision. Dispensing opticians take a two-
year full-time course with a year’s practical
experience, or follow a part-time day-release
course while employed with an optician.
Other Health Professions
Chiropodists, dieticians, medical laboratory
scientific officers, occupational therapists,
orthoptists, physiotherapists and
radiographers, and most recently, orthotists
and prosthetists may, after graduating, apply
for state registration. Each profession has its
own board under the general supervision of
the Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. An application to create a further
board for arts therapists was approved in 1997.
State registration is mandatory for
employment in the NHS and local authorities.
Dental therapists and dental hygienists are
almost exclusively recruited from certified
dental nurses who have taken at least one
year’s training. Dental therapists then take a
two-to-three-year training course and dental
hygienists take a course lasting two years; both
carry out specified dental work under the
supervision of a registered dentist.
National and Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs and SVQs—see p. 137)
have been developed for healthcare support
workers, ambulance personnel, operating
department practitioners, physiological
measurement technicians and administrative
and clerical staff.
Complementary Medicine
Complementary medicine (or complementary
therapies) can cover a range of therapies and
practices, the best known being osteopathy,
chiropractic, homoeopathy, acupuncture and
herbalism. With the exception of
homoeopathy, complementary medicine is
usually available only outside the NHS. There
is a wide variety of regulatory and professional
arrangements ranging from statutory
regulation to little or no regulation at all. The
Government is providing funding to
encourage professional self-regulation.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European Economic
Area (EEA—see p. 78) have special health
arrangements under which EEA nationals
resident in a member state are entitled to
receive emergency treatment, either free or at
a reduced cost, during visits to other EEA
countries. Treatment is provided, in most
cases, on production of a valid Form El 11
209
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
which, in the UK, people should obtain from
a post office before travelling. There are also
arrangements for people who go to another
EEA country specifically for medical care, or
who require continuing treatment for an
existing condition. Unless covered by the
El 11 arrangements, visitors to the UK are
generally expected to pay for routine, non¬
emergency treatment, or if the purpose of
their visit is to seek specific medical treatment.
The UK also has a number of separate
bilateral agreements with certain other
countries, including Australia and New
Zealand.

The Crime and Disorder Act 1998, applicable mainly in England and Wales but
with some UK-wide provisions, is the central feature of the Government’s
criminal policy. Its main themes are:
• reforming youth justice to focus efforts on preventing offending by children
and young people;
• building safer communities through local partnerships and by giving better
protection against anti-social and criminal behaviour; and
• reforming the criminal justice system to improve its performance, reduce
delays and promote public confidence in its operation.
A radical overhaul of the civil justice system is in progress; measures will be
implemented in April 1999. The Government has also announced a new ten-
year strategy for tackling the misuse of drugs.
Introduction
Although the UK is a unitary state, it does not
have a single legal system. Instead, England
and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
have their own systems, with considerable
differences in law, judicial procedure and
court structure. This situation arises from the
different arrangements that existed in the
constituent parts when they were united (see
p. 32). Since 1707 the existence of a single
Parliament for England, Wales and Scotland
and, in civil proceedings, of a common final
court of appeal (the House of Lords), has
resulted in substantial similarity on many
points, while a large volume of modern
legislation applies throughout the UK. In all
three systems there is a common distinction
between criminal law and civil law.
Criminal and Civil Law
Laws can be classified as either criminal or
civil. Criminal law deals with wrongs affecting
the community for which a prosecution may
be brought in the criminal courts. Civil law is
about deciding disputes between two or more
parties—individuals, companies or other
211
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
organisations—and for providing a means of
legal scrutiny of the actions of public bodies.
The purpose of civil proceedings is not to
punish, but to obtain compensation or some
other appropriate remedy, although in
England and Wales the payment of damages
may sometimes have a punitive element.
The distinction between civil and criminal
matters is imprecise. Courts may be classified
as criminal courts and civil courts, but in
England and Wales and Northern Ireland
magistrates’ courts have both a civil and
criminal jurisdiction as have the sheriff courts
in Scotland. Conduct may amount to both a
civil and criminal wrong. However, the court
of trial and the rules of procedure and
evidence will usually differ in civil and
criminal cases.
Increasingly, civil remedies and the
criminal process are being used together to
deal with social problems. The Crime and
Disorder Act 1998 introduces an anti-social
behaviour order, which is a civil order
designed to prevent continued criminal and
sub-criminal anti-social acts. Breach of this
civil order constitutes a criminal offence.
Other recent examples of this overlap are
orders relating to protection from harassment,
and sex offender orders, designed to prevent
behaviour by sex offenders that poses a serious
risk to the public.
Sources of Law
Statutes passed by Parliament are the ultimate
source of law. There are no legal limits on
what may be done by Act of Parliament,
although a legal duty exists to comply with
European Community (EC) law. A statute
may also confer power on a minister, local
authority or other executive body to make
delegated legislation. Provided that the person
exercising the power keeps within what
Parliament intended, delegated legislation is
equivalent to statute. A court cannot declare a
statute to be invalid, and a statute may reverse
a decision by the courts with which Parliament
disagrees. Parliament can repeal an Act,
wholly or partly, replacing it with new
provisions. Sometimes this will follow
recommendations for law reform from an
official committee, or from the Law
Commission, a statutory body established to
examine and report on law reform matters.
Some Acts create new law, while others
consolidate the law by drawing together
existing law on a given topic. Occasionally, all
of the law on a particular topic is codified.
Modern statutes are usually brought into
effect by an order made by a minister of the
Crown. This allows provisions to be brought
into effect when it is practical to do so. The
operation of a statutory provision may be
tested by the use of a pilot scheme: several
new initiatives in respect of young offenders
are being tested in this way in 1998 and 1999.
Occasionally, if circumstances or policies
change, provisions are not brought into effect,
and may be repealed.
Many key areas of law have, over the
centuries, developed through the decisions of
the courts. This is known as common law. The
doctrine of binding precedent means that
decisions of higher courts bind those courts
lower down in the hierarchy of courts. This
ensures consistency of judicial approach.
Judges give reasons for their decisions, and
principles of law are stated, developed and
modified. The common law can develop new
rules, or modify existing ones, but judges
generally take great care not to develop the
common law in novel ways involving policy
choices best left to Parliament. When the
legality of government action is being tested, a
court will try to ensure that it is not
overstepping its proper role; it should avoid
examining the merits of the particular action
or policy being challenged.
European Sources
European Community law, which applies in
the United Kingdom by virtue of membership
of the European Union (see p. 67), derives
from the EC treaties, from the Community
legislation adopted under them, and from the
decisions of the European Court of Justice.
That court has the ultimate authority, under
the Treaty of Rome, to decide points of
Community law. Where a point arises before
the UK court, it may refer the point of law to
the Court of Justice for it to decide that point.
Sometimes a court must make a reference to
the European Court.
212
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
The decisions of the Court of Justice do not
directly bind UK courts, but the United
Kingdom is under treaty obligations to uphold
Community law. Consequently, British courts
are obliged to apply European law, even at the
expense of not applying the provision of an
Act of Parliament. If a rule of statute or
common law is incompatible with Community
law, it is Community law that will be applied
by a UK court.
European Convention on Human Rights
The European Convention on Human Rights
is an international treaty containing a
statement of basic human rights, such as right
to life, prohibition of torture, right to a fair
trial, respect for private and family life, and
freedom of expression and assembly. These
rights are not absolute, and usually have to be
balanced against competing public interests
(for example public health, public safety and
security). Although there are few positive
rights in English law, an individual is entitled
to do whatever is not prohibited, and to
protect those entitlements through the courts.
Although the Convention was ratified by
the UK in 1951, it has not, until 1998, been
part of UK law. The judgments of the Court
of Human Rights are binding in international
law, and the UK has responded to adverse
findings by amending domestic law to rectify
deficiencies. However, the Convention has not
been directly enforceable in the UK, and
individuals have had to have recourse to an
application to the Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg.
Parliament has now passed the Human
Rights Act 1998. This requires all public
authorities, including courts of law, to act in
accordance with the Convention, and enables
individuals to rely on their Convention rights
in any legal proceedings and to bring a claim
against a public authority which has limited
those rights. The Act requires a court to have
regard to the principles developed under the
Convention by the Court of Human Rights
and to give effect to legislation, as far as
possible, in a way which is compatible with
Convention rights. A court cannot declare
invalid an Act of Parliament which is
incompatible with the Convention, but the
higher courts may make a declaration of
incompatibility, which will entitle a minister
in certain circumstances to make delegated
legislation (see p. 47) to amend the offending
Act of Parliament.
Personnel of the Law
The law is enforced by judicial officers,
ranging from judges in the House of Lords
and the superior courts to the stipendiary and
lay justices who, together with juries in certain
cases, are responsible for deciding disputed
cases. The law also depends on officers of the
court who have general or specialised
functions of an administrative, and sometimes
of a judicial, nature in the courts to which they
are attached.
Courts are presided over by judges. Judges
are legally qualified, being appointed by the
Crown on the advice of the Lord Chancellor
(or, in Scotland the Secretary of State)1 from
the ranks of practising barristers and advocates
or solicitors. They have independence of
office, and can only be removed in rare and
limited circumstances involving misconduct
or incapacity. They are not subject to
ministerial control or direction.
Lay magistrates in England and Wales, and
district court justices in Scotland, are trained
in order to give them sufficient knowledge of
the law, including the rules of evidence, and of
the nature and purpose of sentencing. In
Northern Ireland members of a lay panel who
serve in juvenile courts undertake training
courses. Lay magistrates are advised on the
law by magistrates’ clerks. The Lord
Chancellor appoints lay magistrates from
names submitted by local advisory
committees; district court justices in Scotland
are appointed by the Secretary of State for
Scotland on the recommendation of local
justices of the peace advisory committees.
Some courts have one or more full-time,
legally qualified, magistrates (stipendiaries). In
Northern Ireland, resident magistrates, drawn
from practising solicitors or barristers, have
powers similar to those of stipendiary
1 After devolution (see p. 19), most judges will be appointed
on the advice of the Prime Minister.
213
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
magistrates. There are over 30,000 lay
magistrates and 90 stipendiary magistrates in
England and Wales, and 4,000 district court
justices in Scotland.
Although people are free to conduct their
own cases if they so wish, barristers—or
advocates in Scotland—and solicitors
generally represent the interests of parties to a
dispute, and it is rare for an accused person in
a criminal case to be unrepresented. There are
over 9,000 practising barristers in England and
Wales and nearly 71,640 practising solicitors;
Scotland has about 400 practising advocates
and some 8,250 solicitors. Barristers practise
as individuals, but join a group of other
barristers, in Chambers. Advocates practise as
individuals and do not operate from Chambers
as barristers do. Solicitors usually operate in
partnership with other solicitors. Large firms
of solicitors will comprise not only qualified
staff, but also legal executives and support
staff. Certain legal functions may be
performed by non-lawyers—licensed
conveyancers can act in conveyancing matters
(the transfer of interests in land).
Traditionally, rights of audience in the
higher courts—the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, House of Lords, Court of
Appeal, High Court and Crown Court, High
Court of Justiciary (Scotland) and Court of
Session (Scotland)—have mostly been limited
to barristers and advocates, who are regarded
as specialist court pleaders. The power to
extend those rights of audience has existed
since 1990, including in some circumstances
the power to extend them to persons beside
solicitors, barristers and advocates (such as
non-qualified legal staff known as legal
executives). In June 1998 the Government
proposed that all qualified barristers,
advocates and solicitors should have rights of
audience in the higher courts, provided they
meet relevant experience and training
requirements. This would include solicitors
directly employed by government
departments, the Crown Prosecution Service
(CPS) and local authorities.
The two branches of the profession have
separate professional bodies: the Bar Council
for barristers (in Scotland, the Faculty of
Advocates); and the Law Society (or the Law
Society of Scotland) for solicitors. The
profession is self-regulating, with the
professional bodies exercising disciplinary
control over their members.
The Legal Services Ombudsman for
England and Wales conducts investigations
into the way professional bodies handle
complaints against barristers, solicitors and
licensed conveyancers. The Scottish Legal
Services Ombudsman performs a similar task.
Measures Against Crime
Crime Statistics
There are two main measures of the likely
scale of crime in the UK—the recording of
offences by the police, and periodic surveys
among representative samples of crime
victims. In 1997:
• recorded crime in England and Wales
totalled almost 4.6 million offences (see
Table 14.1). In the same year 420,640
crimes were recorded in Scotland and
62,200 in Northern Ireland;
• clear up rates were 28% in England and
Wales, 31.4% in Northern Ireland and
39% in Scotland;
• in England and Wales about 91% of
offences recorded by the police were
against property, while 8% involved
violence. In Scotland, 83% of recorded
crimes involved property, as did 84% in
Northern Ireland.
• in England and Wales, car crime, the
single most common offence, accounted
for about 25% of all recorded crimes.
The misuse of illegal drugs (see p. 217) has
been an increasing factor in the incidence of
property crime. According to recent Home
Office research, more than six out of ten
suspects held in police stations test positive for
illegal drugs. Although, overall, recorded
crime has been falling throughout the UK (for
five consecutive years in England and Wales
and six in Scotland), crimes of violence show a
rising trend. In particular, the number of
sexual offences recorded in England and
Wales rose by 7% in 1997.
In April 1998 the Government amended
the way notifiable offences in England and

Wales are recorded, changing the counting
rules so that the number of crimes
corresponds more closely to the number of
victims. This should lead to greater
comparability between the recorded crime
figures and the results of victim surveys.
British Crime Survey
The biennial British Crime Survey (BCS) asks
a large representative sample of people in
England and Wales about their experience as
victims of household and personal crime in the
previous year. The aim is to provide a count of
crime that includes incidents not reported to
the police and is not affected by changes in the
way police record crime. The BCS can
provide a more complete picture than police
figures of the extent of crime, and gives a
better measure of trends, as willingness to
report types of crime to the police is variable.
The survey can also show which types of
people are most at risk from particular
categories of crime, and what people think of
the police and judiciary, and about related
issues such as fear of crime. The 1998 BCS
estimated that there were 16.4 million crimes
during 1997 (an overall fall of 14% since the
last survey which covered crime in 1995).
Most were against property; although there
was a 7% decrease in burglaries between 1995
and 1997 and vehicle crime also fell; violent
crime fell by 17%.
The 1996 Scottish Crime Survey estimated
that just under 1 million crimes were
committed against individuals and private
households in Scotland during 1995. This was
8% fewer than the number estimated in the
1993 survey.
Crime Prevention
Crime prevention is an important strand of
government criminal justice policy. The
Crime Prevention Agency within the Home
Office develops and co-ordinates prevention
and reduction initiatives in England and
Wales. Its work is overseen by the Crime
Prevention Agency Board, bringing together
the main bodies involved—the Home Office,
the Association of Chief Police Officers,
Crime Concern (an independent organisation
which develops new approaches to crime
reduction and community safety and
encourages business participation in crime
prevention), local government authorities,
police authorities and business. The Agency
supports the police crime prevention effort
through its Crime Prevention College in
North Yorkshire, which is the national centre
for training police officers in prevention skills.
There is a Crime Prevention Council in
Scotland and a Crime Prevention Panel in
Northern Ireland.
Local crime prevention activity includes:
• Neighbourhood Watch schemes, in
which residents look out for suspicious
activity in their area and inform the
police accordingly;
215
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• Crime Prevention Panels, which meet
regularly to examine crime problems in
their area and to suggest practical
solutions; and
• Youth Action Groups, encouraging
young people to tackle problems relevant
to them—for example bullying,
vandalism or drug abuse.
The widespread introduction of closed-
circuit television (CCTV) surveillance systems
is helping in preventing and detecting crime,
and in deterring criminals, in high streets,
shopping centres, schools, industrial estates
and other areas.
In July 1998 the Home Secretary
announced a new Crime Reduction Strategy,
supported by £250 million over three years
from April 1999, to develop and implement an
integrated and cost-effective initiative to
reduce crime and make communities safer.
Crime and Disorder Act 1998
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 creates a
framework designed to keep individuals,
particularly young offenders, out of the
criminal justice system, and to ensure timely
action to prevent reoffending. Particular
emphasis is placed on preventing offending
behaviour by persons under 18 (see p. 226).
The Act requires police services and local
authorities in England and Wales to develop
statutory partnerships for crime prevention
and the promotion of community safety. The
partnerships must examine local levels of
crime and disorder, consult local people and
then set targets for tackling the problems that
have been identified. The statutory provisions
do not, however, apply to Scotland, where
police forces and local authorities already
enter into such partnerships.
Prohibitive anti-social behaviour orders
may be applied to individuals or groups whose
threatening and disruptive conduct harasses
the local community. Anyone in breach of
such an order will be guilty of a criminal
offence. The Act also empowers the courts to
grant an order against convicted sex offenders,
prohibiting behaviour which causes concern
for public safety (for example, loitering near
schools). Anti-social behaviour orders and sex
offender orders are applicable throughout
the UK.
Control of Weapons
The UK has strict legislative controls on
firearms. The police license the possession of
firearms and have powers to regulate their
safekeeping and movement. A ban on the
private ownership of machine guns, high-
powered self-loading rifles and burst-fire
weapons has been extended to include all
handguns. It is illegal to manufacture, sell or
import certain weapons such as
knuckledusters. Penalties relating to the
carrying of knives have been increased.
Helping Victims and Witnesses
In England and Wales a government-funded
organisation, Victim Support, provides
practical help and emotional support to
victims of crime with the help of 12,000
volunteer visitors. It also runs the Witness
Service, which advises victims and other
witnesses attending Crown Court centres.
Similar support schemes operate in Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
In June 1998 the Government published a
report {Speaking up for Justice) on the way in
which victims and witnesses are treated by the
criminal justice system in England and Wales.
The report makes recommendations to give
greater protection to vulnerable witnesses and
those subject to intimidation, from the initial
crime investigation stage through to the trial
and beyond. These include:
• a ban on cross-examination of victims of
rape and serious sexual assault by
defendants who are unrepresented in
court;
• live closed-circuit television links and
screens for witnesses likely to be
distressed by being in court and facing
defendants;
• video-recorded evidence for vulnerable
adults and recorded pre-trial cross-
examination for witnesses suffering from
mental or physical disabilities; and
• measures to help child witnesses give
evidence and understand questioning in
court.
216
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
A similar initiative has been taken in
Scotland.
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland may be eligible
for compensation from public funds under the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. In
Northern Ireland there are separate statutory
arrangements for compensation for criminal
injuries, and for malicious damage to
property.
Tackling Drug Misuse
The Government has stated that the problem
of drug misuse remains formidable. Record
levels of drug seizures reveal the increasing
threat of a widening range of trafficking
routes to the UK (see also p. 88), against a
background of expanding global production.
In England, the previous Government’s
drugs strategy for 1995-98 sought to involve
the voluntary and private sectors, local
authorities, schools, parents, health
professionals and criminal justice agencies in a
comprehensive programme to reduce supply,
demand and misuse of illegal drugs. It aimed
to take action by vigorous law enforcement,
accessible treatment and an emphasis on
education and prevention. To implement the
strategy at local level Drug Action Teams
were set up, comprising senior representatives
from the key statutory agencies—the police,
probation and prison services, customs, and
health and local authorities—working with the
voluntary sector, local media, parents and
young people. Separate strategies were
developed for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
In January 1998 the Government’s newly
appointed Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator (or ‘Drug
Czar’) assumed responsibility for co¬
ordinating the fight against drugs in the UK.
Following his review of the overall direction of
government action and consequent
recommendations, the Government published
a new ten-year strategy (Tackling Drugs to
Build a Better Britain) in April 1998. The
cross-government strategy—focusing mainly
on England, but reflecting the UK and
international dimension of the problem—has
four main elements:
• helping young people resist drug misuse
in order to achieve their full potential in
society;
• protecting communities from drug-
related anti-social and criminal
behaviour;
• enabling people to overcome drug
problems through treatment; and
• stifling the availability of illegal drugs on
the streets.
The main new initiatives propose:
• channelling seized assets from drug
dealers into anti-drug work;
• providing appropriate drug education to
all children aged from 5 to 16;
• piloting drug treatment and testing
orders for offenders;2
• setting targets for reducing drug misuse
based on evidence and experience during
the first year; and
• shifting resources to preventing, rather
than reacting to, the problem.
In April 1998 the Government also
announced plans to implement a Scottish
Drug Misuse Information Strategy to provide
access to reliable information, strengthen
decision-making and measure progress.
In 1997-98 Government expenditure on
tackling drug misuse across the UK was an
estimated £1,400 million. An extra £217
million will be invested in anti-drugs activity
over the years 1999-2002.
Countering Terrorism
In the light of serious terrorist attacks that
have taken place in the UK, it is the
Government’s view that the ordinary criminal
law is not sufficient to deal with terrorism
effectively. The law has been supplemented
by the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary
Provisions) Act 1989 (PTA) and successive
2 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is introducing drug
treatment and testing orders throughout the UK for drug-
misusing offenders aged 16 and over. An order will include
a requirement that the offender submits to drug treatment
and testing under appropriate supervision.
217
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions)
Acts (EPA), and most recently amended and
reinforced by the Criminal Justice (Terrorism
and Conspiracy) Act 1998 (see below).
The PTA has a UK-wide application while
the EPA applies only in Northern Ireland.
Both Acts are temporary and must be renewed
by Parliament each year. They are intended to
strike a balance between providing powers that
are necessary to protect the public and
safeguarding the rights of individuals. They
give the security forces wider powers to
question and arrest people suspected of
involvement in terrorism and to search
property, including vehicles.
The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and
Conspiracy) Act 1998 aims to underpin the
Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland
(see p. 14) by making it easier to secure the
conviction of members of proscribed
organisations which are not observing a
complete and unequivocal ceasefire. It also
makes it an offence to conspire in the UK to
commit terrorist or other serious offences in
another country.
The Government intends to rationalise and
modernise these temporary arrangements and
is drawing up proposals to introduce
permanent UK-wide counter-terrorism
legislation in due course.
Police Service
The Home Secretary and the Scottish and
Northern Ireland Secretaries, together with
police authorities and chief constables, are
responsible for providing an effective and
efficient police service in the UK.
Organisation
There are 52 police forces, organised on a local
basis—43 in England and Wales, eight in
Scotland and one (the Royal Ulster
Constabulary—RUC)3 in Northern Ireland.
The Metropolitan Police Service and the City
of London force are responsible for policing
London. The police service is financed by
central and local government.
Police strength in England and Wales is
about 127,000 (of which the Metropolitan
Police numbers around 26,000). There are
some 14,800 officers in Scotland and 8,500 in
the RUC. Each force in Great Britain has
volunteer special constables who perform
police duties in their spare time, without pay,
acting in support of regular officers. They
number about 20,000 in all.
Police forces are maintained in England and
Wales by local police authorities. In the 41
police areas outside London, they normally
have 17 members—nine locally elected
councillors, three magistrates and five
independent members. The Home Secretary
is currently the police authority for the
Metropolitan Police, although the
Government has put forward proposals for a
new body with a majority of elected
representatives. For the City of London
Police, the authority is a committee of the
Corporation of London. Police authorities, in
consultation with the chief constables and
local community, set local policing objectives,
while the Government sets key objectives for
the police as a whole. The police authorities in
Scotland are composed of elected councillors.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
appoints the Police Authority.
Provincial police forces are headed by chief
constables (appointed by their police
authorities with the Secretary of State’s
approval), who are responsible for the
direction and control of their forces and for
the appointment, promotion and discipline of
all ranks below assistant chief constable. On
matters of efficiency they are generally
answerable to their police authorities. The
Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is
appointed on the recommendation of the
Home Secretary.
Independent inspectors of constabulary
report on the efficiency and effectiveness of
police forces.
3 New legislation provides for the continuance of the RUC
as the body of constables in Northern Ireland, but
introduces the concept of the Northern Ireland Police
Service to include all those staff (including civilians) under
the day-to-day management of the chief constable. Under
the terms of the Good Friday Agreement (see p. 15), an
independent commission is inquiring into policing in
Northern Ireland with the aim of proposing future policing
structures and arrangements which will attract widespread
community support.
218
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
National Crime Bodies
The National Criminal Intelligence Service
(NCIS), which was put on an independent
statutory footing in April 1998, has the leading
role in collecting and analysing criminal
intelligence for use by police forces and other
law enforcement agencies in the UK. It has a
headquarters and south-east regional office in
London, five other regional offices in England
and offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The NCIS co-ordinates the activities of the
Security Services in support of the law
enforcement agencies against organised crime,
and liaises with the International Criminal
Police Organisation (INTERPOL), which
promotes international co-operation between
police forces. It also provides the channel for
communication between the UK and
EUROPOL (see p. 88).
In April 1998 a National Crime Squad,
with 1,400 officers, replaced six regional crime
squads in England and Wales. Its role is to
prevent and detect organised and serious
crime across police force and national
boundaries and to support provincial forces in
their investigation of serious crime. The
Scottish Crime Squad performs the same
function in Scotland.
Information Systems
The Police Information Technology
Organisation (PITO) is responsible for
specifying and procuring the delivery of
national information technology systems (such
as the Police National Computer) for the police
service, and for promoting the National
Strategy for Police Information Systems
(NSPIS—which develops common information
technology applications) at force level.
The Police National Computer provides all
police forces in the UK with rapid 24-hour-a-
day access to operationally essential
information, particularly vehicle information.
Phoenix, the Criminal Justice Record Service,
gives the police direct on-line access to
national records of arrests, cautions, bail
decisions and convictions. In England and
Wales a national automated fingerprint
identification system (NAFIS), linked to the
Police National Computer, will be available to
all forces by the year 2001. In Scotland the
Scottish Criminal Records Office provides a
fully automated criminal and fingerprint
records service, and a project for integrating
the Scottish Criminal Justice Information
System is in progress.
Forensic Science Service
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is a
Home Office executive agency, providing
scientific support in the investigation of crime
and expert evidence to the courts. Its
customers include the police, the Crown
Prosecution Service (CPS), Customs and
Excise, coroners and defence solicitors. The
FSS serves all police forces in England and
Wales through six regional laboratories. It also
operates the national DNA database, which
provides intelligence information to police
forces by matching DNA profiles taken from
suspects to profiles from samples left at the
scenes of crime. In addition, it provides
support to law enforcement agencies overseas.
In Scotland forensic science services are
provided by forces’ own laboratories.
Northern Ireland has its own laboratory.
Powers and Procedures
England and Wales
Police powers and procedures are defined by
legislation and accompanying codes of
practice. Evidence obtained in breach of the
codes may be ruled inadmissible in court. The
codes must be readily accessible in all police
stations.
• Stop and search—Police officers can stop
and search people and vehicles if they
reasonably suspect to find stolen goods,
offensive weapons or implements that
could be used for burglary and other
offences. An officer must record the
grounds for the search, and anything
found, and the person stopped is entitled
to a copy. Senior police officers can
authorise broader stop and search
operations in specified localities if they
believe that serious incidents of violence
may take place, or to prevent acts of
terrorism.
219
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• Arrest—The police may arrest a suspect
on a warrant issued by a court, but can
arrest without warrant for arrestable
offences (for which the sentence is fixed
by law or for which the term of
imprisonment is five years or more). This
category includes serious arrestable
offences such as murder and rape. There
is a general power of arrest for all other
offences if it is inappropriate to proceed
by way of a court summons, or if an
officer believes a suspect may injure
someone else or damage property.
• Detention and questioning—Suspects
must be cautioned before the police can
ask any questions about an offence. They
must be told that they do not have to say
anything, but that anything they do say
may be given in evidence in court, and
that it may be harmful to their defence if
they fail to mention something during
questioning which they later rely on in
court. For arrestable offences, a suspect
can be detained in police custody
without charge for up to 24 hours.
Someone suspected of a serious arrestable
offence can be held for up to 96 hours,
but not beyond 36 hours unless a
warrant is obtained from a magistrates’
court.
Interviews with suspects at police
stations are generally tape-recorded
when the police are investigating
indictable offences and in certain other
cases. Suspects are entitled to a copy of
the recording if charged or told that they
will be prosecuted.
If someone thinks that their detention
is unlawful, they may apply to the High
Court for a writ of habeas corpus against
the person responsible, requiring them to
appear before the court to justify the
detention. Habeas corpus proceedings take
precedence over others.
• Charging—Once there is sufficient
evidence, the police have to decide
whether a detained person should be
charged with an offence. If the police
institute criminal proceedings against a
suspect, the CPS (see p. 221) then takes
control of the case.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
The police in Scotland can arrest someone
without a warrant, under wide common law
powers, if they are seen or reported as
committing a crime or are a danger to
themselves or others. They also have specific
statutory powers of arrest for some offences.
In other cases they may apply to a Justice of
the Peace for a warrant. As in England and
Wales, Scottish police have powers to enter a
building without a warrant if they are
pursuing someone who has committed, or
attempted to commit, a serious crime. A
court can grant the police a warrant to search
premises for stated items in connection with a
crime, again as in England and Wales. The
police may search anyone suspected of
carrying an offensive weapon. Someone
suspected of an imprisonable offence may be
held for police questioning without being
arrested, but for no more than six hours
without being charged. If arrested, suspects
must be charged and cautioned. The case is
then referred to the procurator fiscal (see
p. 229). Tape recording of interviews with
suspects is common practice.
The law in Northern Ireland relating to
police powers in the investigation of crime
and to evidence in criminal proceedings is
similar to that in force in England and Wales.
Firearms
The policy in Great Britain is that the police
should not generally be armed but that there
should be specialist firearms officers,
deployed on the authority of a senior officer
where an operational need arises. Most forces
operate armed response vehicles, that can be
deployed quickly to contain firearms
incidents. In Northern Ireland police officers
are issued with firearms for their personal
protection.
Police Discipline
A police officer may be prosecuted if
suspected of a criminal offence. Officers are
also subject to a disciplinary code designed to
deter abuse of police powers and maintain
public confidence in police impartiality. If
220
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
found guilty of breaching the code, an officer
can be dismissed.
Members of the public can make
complaints against the police if they feel that
they have been treated unfairly or improperly.
In England and Wales the investigation of
such complaints by the force concerned is
overseen, or in more serious cases supervised,
by the independent Police Complaints
Authority. In Scotland complaints against
police officers involving allegations of criminal
conduct are referred to the procurator fiscal
for investigation. The Scottish Inspectorate of
Constabulary considers representations from
complainants dissatisfied with the way the
police have handled their complaints.
In Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints is being
superseded, under new legislation, by a Police
Ombudsman.
Community Relations
Within every police authority there are
police/community liaison consultative
arrangements, involving representatives from
the police, local government and community
groups. Efforts are made to develop relations
with young people through contact with schools.
Lay visiting schemes enable local people to make
unannounced visits to police stations at any time
of the day or night to check on conditions.
Home Office and police service initiatives
aim to ensure that racially motivated crime4 is
treated as a police priority. Forces’ responses
to racial incidents are monitored by the
Inspectorate of Constabulary. Discriminatory
behaviour by police officers, towards other
officers or members of the public, is an offence
under the police disciplinary code.
Police forces recognise the need to recruit
more women and members of the ethnic
minorities in order to ensure the police fully
represent the community. In England and
Wales there are currently about 18,500 women
officers; about 2,300 officers are from ethnic
minorities. The corresponding figures for
Scotland are some 2,230 women officers and
51 officers from ethnic minorities.
4 New racially aggravated offences have been created
under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
The Home Office provides funds for
specialist support to the police service in
community and race relations training.
Legal System of
England and Wales
Responsibility for the administration and
management of the English legal system is
divided between various government
departments and agencies.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary and sits as a member of the judicial
committee of the House of Lords. He also
presides over the House of Lords in its
legislative capacity, and is a senior cabinet
minister heading a government department, the
Lord Chancellor’s Department, which has
overall responsibility for the court system,
including the Supreme Court (comprising the
Court of Appeal, High Court and Crown
Court) and the county courts in England and
Wales. That responsibility is exercised through
the Court Service. He has overall responsibility
for magistrates’ courts. He advises the Crown
on the appointment of most members of the
higher judiciary, and appoints most
magistrates. He has responsibility for the civil
justice process, for promoting general reforms
of the civil law and for the legal aid schemes.
The Home Secretary has overall
responsibility for criminal law, the police
service, the prison system, the probation and
after-care service, and for advising the Crown
on the exercise of the royal prerogative of
mercy.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal legal
advisers, providing advice on a range of legal
matters, including proposed legislation. They
may represent the Crown in appropriate
domestic and international cases of difficulty or
public importance, although do not always do
so. As well as exercising various civil law
functions, the Attorney General has final
responsibility for enforcing the criminal law.
The Solicitor General is the Attorney’s deputy.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS—see
below) is headed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP), who is independent, but
superintended by the Attorney General. Other
prosecuting authorities include the Serious
221
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Fraud Office, which answers to the Attorney
General, and bodies such as the Inland
Revenue, Customs and Excise
Commissioners, local authorities and trading
standards departments which prosecute cases
within their own sphere of activity. Private
prosecutions by individuals are permitted in
respect of most crimes, but some require the
consent of the Attorney General and they may
be taken over by the Director of Public
Prosecutions. They are few in number.
Some administrative functions are
performed by senior members of the judiciary:
the Lord Chief Justice,5 for example, has some
responsibilities for the organisation and work
of the criminal courts. Other functions are
performed by statutory committees. The Civil
Procedure Rules Committee, created by the
Civil Procedure Act 1997, is responsible for
the making of rules that govern the civil
justice process, and comprises members of the
judiciary, members of the legal profession and
lay representatives.
Responsibility for the management of
functions often lies with executive bodies or
agencies. Examples include the Prison
Service, Forensic Science Service, the Legal
Aid Board, and the new Youth Justice Board,
which starts work in October 1998.
The Government is advised by a range of
bodies of a statutory and non-statutory nature.
These include the Inspectorates for the police,
the magistrates’ courts service, the probation
service, the Audit Commission, the Criminal
Justice Consultative Committee, law reform
bodies such as the Law Commission and ad
hoc Royal Commissions and departmental
committees.
PROSECUTION AND THE CRIMINAL
COURTS
Prosecution Arrangements
Crown Prosecution Service
Most criminal prosecutions are dealt with by
the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
5 The Lord Chief Justice is head of the Queen’s Bench
Division of the High Court, and ranks second only to the
Lord Chancellor in the judicial hierarchy.
Created in 1985, the CPS is a national
organisation, with headquarters based in
London and York, and offices throughout
England and Wales. It currently comprises 13
Areas, casework being devolved to local
offices. The police obtain evidence, and
compile case files on offences to be
prosecuted. It is these files that form the basis
of CPS work. The evidence in the file is
reviewed by the CPS in order to ensure that
the charge laid by the police can be sustained
and is in the public interest. If the charge is
inappropriate it may be varied or, if the
evidence is not sufficient, it may be
downgraded, or the case discontinued.
Following some criticisms of
overcentralisation, the CPS is now being
reorganised. It will in future comprise 42
Areas, each to correspond with a police force
area, and designed to achieve devolution of
responsibility and accountability. This is
meant to ensure that all but the most senior
lawyers spend more time prosecuting and that
proper and effective administrative support
and services are provided locally. Each of the
42 Areas will be headed by a Chief Crown
Prosecutor supported by an Area Business
Manager, with responsibility for liaison with
other criminal justice agencies and the detailed
management and administration of the Area.
The prosecution process will be under the
direct control of the Chief Crown Prosecutor,
and the role of CPS national headquarters will
be focused on setting a national framework for
prosecution and resourcing and monitoring
the 42 Areas.
Serious Fraud Office
Cases of serious or complex fraud are
prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office.
Investigations are conducted by teams of
lawyers, accountants, police officers and other
specialists. The Office has wide powers that
go beyond those normally available to the
police and prosecuting authorities.
Initial Stages
For minor offences, the police may decide to
caution the offender rather than prosecute. A
222
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Structure of the Courts in England and Wales
caution does not amount to a conviction, and
will not take place unless the person admits
the offence. Under the Crime and Disorder
Act 1998, cautioning for young offenders is to
be replaced with the final warnings scheme
(see p. 226).
If the police decide to charge a person, that
person may be released on bail to attend a
magistrates’ court. If not granted police bail,
the defendant must be brought before a
magistrates’ court (or, if under 18, a youth
court) as soon as possible. There is a general
right to bail, but magistrates may withhold
bail if there are substantial grounds for
believing that an accused person would
abscond, commit an offence, or otherwise
obstruct justice.
If bail is refused, an accused has the right to
apply again, subject to certain limitations, to
the Crown Court or to a High Court judge in
chambers. He or she must be told of this right.
In certain circumstances, the prosecution may
appeal to a Crown Court judge against the
granting of bail by magistrates.
Once a person has been charged, it is for
the CPS to decide whether the case should
proceed, in the light of guidelines in the Code
for Crown Prosecutors, issued under statute
by the DPP. A prosecution will proceed if a
prosecutor is satisfied that there is, on the
evidence, a realistic prospect of conviction,
and, if so, that it is in the public interest for
the prosecution to proceed.
The Criminal Courts
Criminal offences are divided into: summary
offences, which are the least serious and are
triable only in a magistrates’ court; and
indictable ones, which are subdivided into
‘indictable-only’ offences (such as murder,
manslaughter or robbery) which must be tried
on indictment6 at the Crown Court by judge
and jury, and either-way offences, which may
be tried either summarily or on indictment.
Either-way offences, such as theft and burglary,
can vary greatly in seriousness. A magistrates’
court decides whether an either-way case is
6 An indictment is a written accusation against a person,
charging him or her with serious crime triable by jury.
223
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
serious enough to warrant trial in the Crown
Court, but if the magistrates decide in favour of
summary trial, the accused person can elect to
have trial by jury in the Crown Court.
Magistrates’ courts deal with about 97% of
criminal offence prosecutions in England and
Wales.
Where a case is to be tried on indictment, the
magistrates’ court must be satisfied that there is
a case to answer. In most cases this is accepted
by the defence and the magistrates do not need
to consider the evidence. If the defence
challenge the case, the magistrates consider the
documentary evidence: no witnesses are called
to give evidence. If there is a case to be
answered, the accused is committed for trial.
A magistrates’ court usually comprises three
lay magistrates (see also p. 213), known as
justices of the peace (JPs), who sit with a court
clerk to advise them on law and procedure. The
court clerk will be qualified to act as such,
although not always a qualified lawyer. In some
areas a stipendiary (paid professional) magistrate
sits instead of the JPs. Stipendiary magistrates
are now increasingly common, although most
cases are dealt with by lay magistrates.
Responsibility for running the magistrates’
courts service locally rests with magistrates’
courts committees (MCCs). There are at
present 96 MCCs made up of lay magistrates
selected by their colleagues. The number of
MCCs is to be reduced, and their areas
increased, to improve efficiency and to bring
their boundaries to closer alignment with those
of other criminal justice agencies, such as the
police and CPS.
Youth courts are specialist magistrates’
courts, which sit separately from those dealing
with adults. They deal with all but the most
serious charges against people aged at least 10
(the age of criminal responsibility) and under
18. JPs who have been specially trained sit in
youth courts. Proceedings are held in private.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 venues,
in six regional areas called circuits, and is
presided over by High Court judges, circuit
judges and part-time recorders. The type of
judge who will preside over a case, with a jury
of 12 members of the public, will depend on
which Crown Court the case is being heard in:
not all Crown Courts deal with cases of the
same level of seriousness.
Trial
Criminal trials have two parties: the
prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved beyond reasonable
doubt by the prosecution.
Pre-Trial Procedure
An accused person has a right at all stages to
remain silent; however, an adverse inference
may be drawn from a failure to mention facts
when questioned or charged. Changes in the
law have led to a greater level of pre-trial
disclosure by both prosecution and defence.
Under these:
• the prosecution must disclose material in
its possession that it does not intend to
use in the trial (unused material) but
which might weaken its own case;
• in limited circumstances sensitive
information can be protected from
disclosure;
• an accused person must (in an indictable
case) give a general indication of the
nature of any defence, including details
of an alibi; the prosecution must then
disclose any unused material which
assists the defence case; and
• a judge may, in a case to be tried on
indictment, hold a pre-trial hearing, and
give a preliminary ruling on a question of
law.
Trial Procedure
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court. The burden of proof is on the
prosecution, and strict rules of evidence
govern how matters may be proved. Certain
types of evidence may be excluded because of
their prejudicial effect, or because of their
unreliability. Documentary statements by
witnesses are allowed with the consent of the
other party or in limited circumstances at the
discretion of the court. Otherwise evidence is
taken from witnesses testifying orally. Any
person who is capable of giving intelligible
testimony can testify. A child in some
circumstances can testify through a live TV
224
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
link, and the court may consider a video-
recorded interview as the evidence of the
child, subject to the defence having the right
to question the child in cross-examination.
These provisions are designed to protect
children from the adverse effects of going to
court. The position relating to other
vulnerable witnesses is under review.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the case to the jury, and
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
The jury verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not
guilty’, the latter resulting in acquittal. Juries
may, subject to certain conditions, reach a
verdict by a majority of at least 10-2.
If an accused is acquitted, there is no right of
prosecution appeal, and the accused cannot be
tried again for that same offence. An acquittal
may be set aside and a retrial ordered if the
acquittal has been tainted by a conviction for
interfering with or intimidating a juror.
A jury is independent of the judiciary and
any attempt to interfere with its members is a
criminal offence. People aged between 18 and
70 whose names appear on the electoral register
are, with certain exceptions, liable for jury
service; their names are chosen at random.
Sentencing
The court will sentence the offender after
considering all the relevant information,
which may include a pre-sentence report and
any other necessary specialist report, and a
plea in mitigation by a defence advocate. The
powers of the magistrates’ court in respect of
sentence are limited to a maximum period of
12 months’ imprisonment for two or more
offences; the offender may be sent to the
Crown Court for sentence if the magistrates
feel their powers of sentence are insufficient.
A custodial sentence can be imposed only
where the offence is so serious that a custodial
sentence alone is justified. A term of up to two
years’ imprisonment may be suspended. A
second serious violent or sexual offence
requires a court to impose a life sentence. Life
imprisonment is the mandatory sentence for
murder, and is available for certain other
offences. A life sentence enables an offender to
be released when it is considered he or she no
longer poses a risk to the community, and has
been punished enough.
Prisoners may be released having served
only part of their sentence (see p. 235); more
serious offenders are released only on the
recommendation of the Parole Board. The
decision to release a murderer is that of the
Home Secretary. Prisoners will often be
subject to supervision after release, and certain
sex offenders are obliged to notify their name
and address to the police.
For offences not so serious as to require a
custodial sentence, community sentences may
be imposed. These can include probation
orders (involving supervision in the
community—see p. 236), community service
(work within the community), combination
orders (a mixture of probation and community
service), and curfew orders (requiring the
offender to remain at a specified place for
specified periods, monitored by electronic
tagging).
About 75% of offenders are punished with
a fine. A court may also impose compensation
orders, which require the offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence; or impose a
conditional discharge, whereby the offender
may be resentenced for the original offence if
the discharge is broken by reoffending.
Young Offenders
Offenders aged 10 to 17 years come within the
jurisdiction of youth courts, but may also be
tried in an adult magistrates’ court or in a
Crown Court, depending on the nature of the
offence. Existing non-custodial penalties
include: conditional discharge; fines and
compensation orders (where the parents of
offenders may be ordered to pay); supervision
orders (where the offender would have to
comply with certain requirements, which
might possibly include a stay in local authority
accommodation); and attendance centre
orders; 16 and 17 year olds may also be given
the same probation, community service,
combination and curfew orders as older
offenders.
225
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Custodial sentences are available to the
courts where no alternative is considered
appropriate. The main custodial sentence for
those aged 15 and over is currently detention
in a young offender institution. Remission of
part of the sentence for good behaviour,
release on parole and supervision on release
are available. A Secure Training Order may be
given to those aged 12 to 14 who fulfil certain
strict criteria.
A number of measures have been taken
under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to
prevent offending and reoffending by young
people. Local authorities will be required to
produce annual youth justice plans detailing
how youth justice services in their areas will
be provided and funded. They will also have
to establish one or more youth offending
teams whose membership will be drawn from
the police, social services, the probation
service, health and education authorities and
the voluntary sector. As well as supervising
existing community sentences, these teams
will provide and supervise a range of new
orders and powers under the Act (see below).
The Act introduces a statutory final
warning scheme to replace the practice of
repeat cautioning. The scheme is intended to
provide a swift response to early incidences of
criminal behaviour, and a final warning will
also trigger referral to a youth offending team
to draw up a rehabilitation programme to
address the factors which led the young
person into offending.
New orders include: a reparation order,
which will require young offenders to make
non-financial reparation to the victim(s) of
their offence or to the community which they
have harmed; and an action plan order, which
will require them to comply with an
individually tailored action plan intended to
address their offending behaviour. These new
orders, together with the final warning
scheme, are being piloted in certain specified
areas for 18 months from the end of
September 1998. There will also be a detention
and training order, which will combine custody
and community supervision; this is expected
to be implemented by mid-1999.
The new criminal orders will be
complemented by a range of other powers.
These include parenting orders, which will
require a parent or guardian to attend
counselling and guidance sessions and to
comply with specified requirements; and child
safety orders, which place a child under 10 who
is at risk of becoming involved in crime or is
behaving in an anti-social manner under the
supervision of a specified, responsible officer.
A Youth Justice Board will, from October
1998, monitor the youth justice system,
promote good practice and advise the Home
Secretary on the operation of the system and
the setting of national standards.
Appeals
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the High Court, on points of
law, and to the Crown Court, by way of
rehearing. Appeals from the Crown Court go
to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A
further appeal can be made to the House of
Lords on points of law of public importance.
A prosecutor cannot appeal against an
acquittal, but mechanisms exist to review
over-lenient sentences and rulings of law.
Alleged miscarriages of justice in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland are reviewed by
the Criminal Cases Review Commission,
which is independent of both Government
and the courts. Referral of a case requires
some new argument or evidence not
previously raised at the trial or on appeal.
Coroners’ Courts
The coroner (usually a senior lawyer or
doctor) must hold an inquest if the deceased
died violently, unnaturally, suddenly, if the
cause is unknown, or in prison or in other
specified circumstances. The coroner’s court
establishes how, when and where the deceased
died. A coroner may sit alone or, in certain
circumstances, with a jury.
THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Jurisdiction in civil matters is split between the
High Court and the county courts. Some 90%
of all cases are dealt with by the county courts,
but most civil disputes do not go to court at all.
Many are dealt with through statutory or
voluntary complaints mechanisms, or through
226
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
mediation and negotiation. Arbitration is a
common form of adjudication in commercial
and building disputes. Ombudsmen have the
power to determine complaints in the public
sector, and, on a voluntary basis, in some private
sector activities (for example, banking,
insurance and pensions).
A large number of tribunals exist to
determine disputes. About 80 different types
of tribunal are supervised by a statutory
supervisory body, the Council on Tribunals,
and deal with disputes such as liability for tax
(Inland Revenue Commissioners), eligibility
for social benefit (Social Security Appeals
Tribunals) and the compulsory treatment of
an individual for mental health problems
(Mental Health Review Tribunals).
Courts
The High Court is divided into three
Divisions (see chart on p. 223).
• The Queen’s Bench Division deals with
disputes relating to contracts, general
commercial matters (in a specialist
Commercial Court), and liability in tort
(general civil wrongs, such as accidents
caused by negligence, or defamation of
character). A Queen’s Bench Divisional
Court has special responsibility for
dealing with applications for judicial
review of the actions of public bodies,
and has the power to declare the action of
a public individual, department or body
unlawful.
• The Chancery Division deals with
disputes relating to land, wills,
companies and insolvency.
• The Family Division deals with matters
relating to divorce and the welfare of
children.
The county courts deal with claims in
contract and in tort, with family matters
(including divorce and the welfare of children)
and a wide range of statutory matters. All
personal injury cases involving amounts below
£50,000 begin in a county court. Actions
involving amounts below £25,000 are tried in
a county court, unless they are of particular
importance or complexity. Cases involving
sums between £25,000 and £50,000 are
allocated between county courts and the High
Court according to the criteria of ‘substance,
importance, complexity and judicial
availability’. The High Court tries cases
involving amounts above £50,000, unless they
are so straightforward as not to merit trial in
that forum. The county courts have a ‘small
claims’ procedure, designed to provide a
cheap, informal and speedy means of resolving
small disputes, without the need for legal
representation. The small claims limits are at
present £3,000 (but see p. 228), with the
exception of personal injury claims, where the
limit remains at £1,000.
Magistrates’ courts have limited civil
jurisdiction, in family matters (when they sit
as a Family Proceedings Court) and in
miscellaneous civil orders.
Appeals
Appeals in civil cases in the county courts or
High Court generally go the Court of Appeal
(Civil Division). Appeals from magistrates’
courts in civil matters go to the High Court,
on matters of law, or to the Crown Court, if
the case is to be re-heard. A further appeal on
points of law of public importance goes to the
House of Lords.
Reform of the Civil Justice System
Civil litigation has, in many cases, become
slow, cumbersome and expensive. The pace,
conduct and extent of litigation is left in the
hands of the parties, with no effective control
of excesses, and is largely adversarial in
nature, with each side employing their own
experts, and costs rising as parties seek to meet
the case against them. Rules of court are often
flouted, with limited sanctions for breach.
A thorough review of the civil justice
system is being undertaken. The aim is to
create a unified system to deal with civil
claims, based on the principle that the conduct
of the litigation should not be left solely to the
parties. Courts will become more proactive in
case management. The essential features of
the new scheme, to be implemented in April
1999, are:
227
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
a small claims jurisdiction extended up to
£5,000;
a new fast-track for straightforward cases
not exceeding £15,000. This will be a
strictly limited procedure designed to
take cases to trial within a short but
reasonable timescale. There will be fixed
costs, and limited obligations to supply
documents to the other parties. The
hearing will usually be no more than one
day. There will be no oral evidence from
experts, unless the court otherwise
directs;
• a new multi-track, for cases above
£15,000, spanning both High Court and
county court cases and providing
appropriate and proportionate case
management. Individual hands-on case
management will be concentrated on
those cases which require significant
attention and will most benefit from it.
Other cases in the multi-track will
proceed on standard or individually
tailored timetables, according to standard
or individual directions;
• within the multi-track there will be
effective consideration of the case at two
key stages at least: a case management
conference early in the case; and a pre¬
trial review, shortly before trial;
• cases will be managed and heard by the
appropriate level of judge and will be able
to move flexibly within the system to
ensure this; and
• the cases will be managed by procedural
judges who, for the heavier cases
requiring full judicial control, may be a
High Court or circuit judge. The
procedural judge will: conduct the initial
scrutiny of all cases to allocate them to
the appropriate management track;
conduct the case management conference
unless it is more appropriate for the trial
judge to do so; generally monitor the
progress of the case and investigate if
parties are failing to comply with
timetables or directions.
To establish the framework, legislation
passed in 1997 provides for:
• a Civil Justice Council, an advisory body
to keep the civil justice system under
review and make proposals for research;
and
• a Civil Procedure Rule Committee, with
the power to make rules of court for all
civil, non-matrimonial litigation, creating
a unified system of procedure.
Legal System of Scotland
Scots law belongs to a small group of ‘mixed’
legal systems which have legal principles, rules
and concepts modelled on both Roman and
English law. The main sources of Scots law
are judge-made law, certain legal treatises
having ‘institutional’ authority, legislation,
and EC law. The first two sources are
sometimes referred to as the common law of
Scotland. Legislation, as in the rest of the UK,
consists of statutes (Acts of Parliament) or
subordinate legislation authorised by
Parliament.
PROSECUTION AND THE CRIMINAL
COURTS
Awaiting Trial
When arrested, an accused person in Scotland
may be released by the police to await
summons, on an undertaking to appear at
court at a specified time, or be held in custody
to appear at court on the next working day.
Following that appearance, the accused person
may be remanded in custody until trial or
released by the court on bail. If released on
bail, the accused person must undertake to
appear at trial when required, not to commit
an offence while on bail, and not to interfere
with witnesses or obstruct justice. The court
may impose additional conditions on the
accused (for example, to keep away from
certain people or locations). There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by an accused
person against the refusal of bail, or by the
prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by
either against the conditions imposed.
Bail will not granted where an accused
person is charged with murder, culpable
homicide, rape or attempted rape, and has any
previous conviction for such a crime (in the
228
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
case of culpable homicide, involving a prison
sentence).
Prosecution Arrangements
The Lord Advocate (the principal Law
Officer of the Crown in Scotland) is
responsible for prosecutions in the High
Court, sheriff courts and district courts. In
contrast to England, the police in Scotland
cannot initiate criminal proceedings, and
private prosecutions are extremely rare. The
Lord Advocate discharges his responsibility
for criminal prosecution through the Crown
Office, which is staffed by legally qualified
civil servants and run by the Crown Agent,
who is head of the Procurator Fiscal Service.
Procurators fiscal are the Lord Advocate’s
local representatives, with one for each sheriff
court. They are lawyers and full-time civil
servants subject to the direction of the Crown
Office. They must be either advocates or
solicitors, but are usually solicitors.
Prosecutions in the High Court are
prepared by procurators fiscal and Crown
Office officials, and are conducted by the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for
Scotland; they in turn delegate the bulk of
their work to advocates depute, collectively
known as Crown Counsel, of whom there are
13. In all other criminal courts the decision to
prosecute is made, and prosecution carried
out, by procurators fiscal.
The police report gives details of alleged
crimes to the local procurator fiscal who has
discretion whether or not to prosecute. He or
she may receive instructions from the Crown
Council on behalf of the Lord Advocate, who
in turn is answerable to Parliament.
The office of coroner does not exist in
Scotland. Instead the local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into sudden or suspicious
deaths and may report the findings to the
Crown Office. When appropriate, a fatal
accident inquiry may be held before the sheriff;
this is mandatory in cases of death resulting
from industrial accidents and deaths in custody.
Criminal Courts
There are three criminal courts in Scotland:
the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court
and the district court. Cases are heard under
one of two types of criminal procedure:
• In solemn procedure in both the High
Court of Justiciary and the Sheriff Court,
an accused person’s trial takes place
before a judge sitting with a jury of 15 lay
people. As in England and Wales, the
alleged offence is set out in a document
called an indictment. The judge decides
questions of law and the jury decide
questions of fact and may reach a
decision by a simple majority. They may
decide to find the accused ‘guilty’, ‘not
guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the last two are
acquittals and have the effect that the
accused cannot be tried again for the
same offence.
• In summary procedure in sheriff and
district courts, the judge sits without a
jury and decides questions of both fact
and law. The offence charged is set out in
a document called a summary complaint.
In Scotland the court in summary cases is
required to call an additional hearing
(intermediate diet) at some time between the
court appearance and the trial to establish the
state of readiness of both the defence and the
prosecution. Solemn procedure in the sheriff
court also requires a hearing to find out
whether the case is ready to go for trial. The
prosecution in solemn cases must give the
defence advance notice of the witnesses it
intends to call and of the documents and other
items on which it will rely.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme
criminal court in Scotland, sitting in
Edinburgh, Glasgow and other major towns
and cities. It tries the most serious crimes and
has exclusive jurisdiction in cases involving
murder, treason and rape.
The 49 sheriff courts deal mainly with less
serious offences committed within their local
area or the sheriff court district over which
they have jurisdiction. These courts are
organised in six sheriffdoms, and at the head
of the judiciary of each sheriffdom is the
sheriff principal. There are over 100
permanent sheriffs, most of whom are
appointed to particular courts. Fifteen are
‘floating’ sheriffs who may take cases in any
229
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
court. In addition, there is a panel of
temporary sheriffs who may undertake duties
in any sheriffdom.
The sheriff has jurisdiction in both
summary and solemn criminal cases. In the
summary court, the sheriff may impose prison
sentences of up to three months, or in some
cases 12 months, or a fine not exceeding the
‘prescribed sum’, that is up to £5,000 for a
common law offence. Under solemn
procedure, the sheriff may impose
imprisonment for up to three years and
unlimited financial penalties, and has an
additional power of remit to the High Court of
Justiciary if he or she thinks a heavier sentence
should be imposed. The sheriff also has
available a range of non-custodial sentences,
principally community service and probation.
District courts, which deal with minor
offences, are the administrative responsibility
of the local authority. The longest prison
sentence which can be imposed is generally 60
days and the maximum fine is £2,500. The
bench of a district court will usually be
constituted by one or more lay justices of the
peace. Subject to the approval of the Secretary
of State, a local authority may also appoint a
stipendiary magistrate, who must be a
professional lawyer of at least five years’
standing, and who has the same summary
criminal jurisdiction and powers as a sheriff.
At present, only Glasgow has stipendiary
magistrates sitting in the district court.
Sentencing
In Scotland a court must obtain a social enquiry
report before imposing a custodial sentence if
the accused is aged under 21 or has not
previously served a custodial sentence. A report
is also required before making a probation or
community service order, or in cases involving
people already subject to supervision.
Non-custodial sentences
Non-custodial sentences available to the
courts include fines, and community service
orders, for which the minimum number of
hours is 80 and the maximum, under solemn
procedure, 300. Restriction of liberty orders,
restricting an offender’s movements for up to
12 months, are being piloted in three areas.
Compliance is monitored by electronic means.
Offenders must be aged 16 or over.
Supervised attendance orders provide an
alternative to imprisonment for fine default,
and incorporate aspects of work and training.
Appeals
The High Court of Justiciary also sits (in a
court of at least two judges) as the Scottish
Court of Criminal Appeal. In both solemn and
summary procedure, a convicted person may
appeal against conviction, or sentence, or
both. The Court may authorise a retrial if it
sets aside a conviction. There is no appeal
from this court in criminal cases.
CIVIL COURTS
The main civil courts are the Court of Session
(the supreme court, subject to appeal only to
the House of Lords in London) and the sheriff
court (the principal local court).
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh, and
may hear cases at first instance as well as those
transferred to it and appealed from sheriff
courts and from tribunals. A leading principle
of the court is that cases originating in it are
both prepared for decision, and decided, by
judges sitting singly whose decisions are
subject to review by several judges. The total
number of judges is 27, of whom 19, called
Lords Ordinary, mainly decide cases in the
first instance. This branch of the court is
called the Outer House. The other eight
judges are divided into two divisions of four
judges each, forming the Inner House. The
First Division is presided over by the Lord
President of the Court of Session and the
Second Division by the Lord Justice-Clerk.
The main business of each division is to
review the decisions of the Lords Ordinary or
inferior courts which have been appealed to it.
In addition to its criminal jurisdiction, the
sheriff court deals with most civil litigation in
Scotland. Its jurisdiction is very wide. The
value of the subject matter with which the court
can deal has, with very few exceptions, no upper
limit, and a broad range of remedies can be
granted. Cases dealt with include, among other
things, debts, contract, reparation, rent
restrictions, actions affecting the use of
230
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
property, or affecting leases and tenancies, and
actions in relation to children. It also deals with
actions between husband and wife, and can vary
Court of Session decrees dealing with parental
rights and responsibilities or awards of custody
or financial provision. The sheriff court has
concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of
Session in actions for divorce. There is a right of
appeal in some cases from the sheriff to the
Sheriff Principal and thence, in some cases, to
the Court of Session.
Civil Proceedings
The formal proceedings in the Court of
Session are initiated by serving the defender
with a summons or, in sheriff court cases in
ordinary actions, an initial writ. A defender
who intends to contest the action must inform
the court; if he or she fails to do so, the court
normally grants a decree in absence in favour
of the pursuer. Where a case is contested, both
parties must prepare written pleadings. Time
is allowed for either party to adjust their
pleadings in the light of what the other has
said. At the end of this period a hearing will
normally be arranged.
In summary actions involving sums
between £750 and £1,500 in the sheriff court,
a statement of claim is incorporated in a
summons. The procedure is designed to
enable most actions to be settled without the
parties having to appear in court. Normally,
they, or their representatives, need appear
only when an action is defended.
In cases below £750 a special small claim
procedure enables those who do not have legal
advice to raise claims themselves. The
procedures are similar to, but less formal than,
the summary procedure. In addition to the
courts, there is a wide range of tribunals which
administer justice in special types of case.
Many of these are common to the rest of
Great Britain; others, such as the Land Court,
the Lands Tribunal and the Children’s
Hearings, are peculiar to Scotland.
Children
Criminal proceedings may be brought against
any child aged 8 years or over, but the
instructions of the Lord Advocate are
necessary before anyone under 16 years of age
is prosecuted.
Most children under 16 who have
committed an offence or are considered to be
in need of care and protection may be brought
before a children’s hearing. The hearing,
consisting of three lay people appointed from
a Panel nominated by the Secretary of State,
determines in an informal setting, often with
the child and his or her parents, whether
compulsory measures of care are required and,
if so, the form they should take. An official
known as the reporter to the children’s
hearing decides whether the child should
come before a hearing. If the grounds for
referral for a hearing are not accepted by the
child or parent, the case goes to the sheriff for
proof to establish the grounds. If the sheriff
finds the grounds established, he or she sends
the case back to the reporter to arrange a
children’s hearing. The sheriff also hears
appeals against a hearing’s decision.
Government proposals to reduce the time
taken for cases to be processed by the
children’s hearing system were published in
February 1998.
Young people aged between 16 and 21
serve custodial sentences in young offender
institutions. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE
SCOTTISH LEGAL SYSTEM
Courts Administration
Responsibility for organising and
administering the Supreme Courts and the
sheriff courts is shared by the courts
themselves and the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The Supreme Courts, the Court of
Session and the High Court of Justiciary enact
the rules regulating their own procedure and
the procedures of the sheriff courts and the lay
summary courts. The Rules Council, Court of
Session and Criminal Courts and the Sheriff
Court Rules Council, consisting of judges and
legal practitioners, advise the courts about
amending the rules.
231
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Ministerial Supervision
The Secretary of State for Scotland
recommends the appointment of all members
of the judiciary other than the most senior
ones (who are appointed on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister),
appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session, and is
responsible for the administration and staffing
of the sheriff courts. These functions are
carried out on his behalf by an executive
agency, the Scottish Court Service. The
Secretary of State is also responsible for
Scottish criminal law, crime prevention, the
police, the penal system, legal aid, and
substantive civil law.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland, both government
ministers, are the chief legal advisers to the
Government on Scottish questions and the
principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of prosecutions and other litigation
in Scotland. The Lord Advocate also has
ministerial responsibility, among other things,
for the law of evidence (civil and criminal), for
jurisdiction and procedures of the civil courts
in Scotland, for enforcement of the orders of
those courts, and for relations between the
Scottish civil courts and legal system and
other legal systems.
SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
The role of the Scottish Parliament (see also
p. 19) will be to make laws in relation to
devolved matters in Scotland. In these
devolved areas, it will be able to amend or
repeal existing Acts of the UK Parliament and
to pass new legislation of its own in relation to
devolved matters. It will also be able to
consider and pass private legislation,
promoted by individuals or bodies (for
example, local authorities) in relation to
devolved matters.
As regards the legal system, the greater part
of the criminal justice system will be
devolved—responsibility for the courts, the
criminal law including evidence and
procedure as well as the police and prisons—
reflecting an acknowledgment of the need for
the different agencies involved in the criminal
justice system to work together. However,
since Scotland shares with the rest of the UK
a common approach in statute law in the
significant areas of drugs, firearms and road
traffic law, these powers will be reserved.
Much of the responsibility for Scots private
law or civil law will also devolve. This will
include the power to legislate on the law of
persons, the law of obligations and the law of
civil remedies, which cut across both
substantive civil and procedural law.
Role of the Law Officers in Scotland
Since the responsibilities of the Lord
Advocate for investigating and prosecuting
crime will be devolved, and since the Scottish
Executive will also require advice on legal
matters, the Scotland Act 1998 provides for
the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General
for Scotland to serve as the Law Officers of
the Scottish Executive, to provide it with
advice on legal matters and to represent its
interests in the courts. Both officers will cease
to be members of the UK Government.
At the same time the UK Government will
continue to need advice on Scots law: this will
be provided by the new Law Officer to the
UK, to be called the Advocate General for
Scotland. The holder of the office will have
ministerial status and should be a Scots lawyer
of eminence and authority.
Legal System of
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland’s legal system is similar to
that in England and Wales. Jury trials have the
same place in the system, except in the case of
offences involving acts of terrorism (see
below). In addition, the course of litigation is
the same and the legal profession has the same
two branches.
Superior Courts
The Supreme Court of Judicature comprises
the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the
Crown Court. All matters relating to these
courts are under the jurisdiction of the UK
Parliament. Judges are appointed by the Crown.
232
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
The Court of Appeal comprises the Lord
Chief Justice (as President) and two Lords
Justices of Appeal. The High Court comprises
the Lord Chief Justice and five other judges.
The practice and procedure of the Court of
Appeal and the High Court are virtually the
same as in the corresponding courts in
England and Wales. Both courts sit in the
Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast.
The Court of Appeal has power to review
the civil law decisions of the High Court and
the criminal law decisions of the Crown
Court, and may in certain cases review the
decisions of county courts and magistrates’
courts. Subject to certain restrictions, an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal can go to the House of Lords.
The High Court is divided into a Queen’s
Bench Division, dealing with most civil law
matters; a Chancery Division, dealing with,
for instance, trusts and estates, title to land,
mortgages and charges, wills and company
matters; and a Family Division, dealing
principally with matrimonial causes, adoption,
wardship, patients’ affairs and undisputed
probate matters.
The Croton Court deals with all serious
criminal cases.
Inferior Courts
The inferior courts are the county courts and the
magistrates’ courts, both of which differ in a
number of ways from their counterparts in
England and Wales.
County courts are primarily civil law courts.
They are presided over by one of 14 county
court judges, two of whom—in Belfast and
Londonderry—have the title of recorder.
Appeals go from the county courts to the High
Court. The county courts also deal with appeals
from the magistrates’ courts in both criminal and
civil matters. In civil matters, the county courts
handle most actions in which the amount or the
value of specific articles claimed is below a
certain value. The courts also deal with actions
involving title to, or the recovery of, land; equity
matters such as trusts and estates; mortgages;
and the sale of land and partnerships.
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily
with minor local criminal cases is carried out
in magistrates’ courts presided over by a full¬
time, legally qualified resident magistrate. The
magistrates’ courts also exercise jurisdiction in
certain family law cases and have a very
limited jurisdiction in other civil cases.
Terrorist Offences
People accused of offences specified under
emergency legislation (see pp. 217-8) are tried
in the Crown Court without jury. The onus
remains on the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt and the defendant
has the right to be represented by a lawyer of
his or her choice. The judge must set out in a
written statement the reasons for convicting
and there is an automatic right of appeal to the
Court of Appeal against conviction and/or
sentence on points of fact as well as of law.
Administration of the Law
Court administration is the responsibility of the
Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland
Following the Good Friday Agreement of
April 1998 (see p. 14), the Government has
launched a review of criminal justice in
Northern Ireland. (This excludes policing
and emergency legislation, which are being
considered separately.) The review will
address the structure, management and
resourcing of publicly funded elements of
the criminal justice system, covering issues
such as:
• appointments to the judiciary and
magistracy;
• the organisation and supervision of
the prosecution process;
• the responsiveness and accountability
of the system;
• law reform;
• scope for co-operation between
agencies in Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic; and
• the structure and organisation of
criminal justice functions that might
be devolved to a Northern Ireland
Assembly.
233
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Office, under the Secretary of State, deals with
policy and legislation concerning criminal law,
the police and the penal system. The Lord
Chancellor has general responsibility for legal
aid, advice and assistance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, who is responsible to the
Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried
on indictment, and may do so in other
(summary) cases. Most summary offences are
prosecuted by the police.
Prison Service
The Prison Service in England and Wales, the
Scottish Prison Service and the Northern
Ireland Prison Service are all executive
agencies. There are currently 138 prison
establishments in England and Wales (7 of
which are run by private contractors), 22 in
Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland.
Prison accommodation ranges from open
prisons to high security establishments.
Sentenced prisoners are classified into different
risk-level groups for security purposes. Women
prisoners are held in separate prisons or in
separate accommodation in mixed prisons.
There are no open prisons in Northern Ireland,
where over half of offenders are serving
sentences for terrorist-related offences.
In recent years the prison population has
been growing steadily in Great Britain, but
falling in Northern Ireland (see Table 14.2).
Table 14.2: Average Daily Prison
Population, 1993-97

Source: Home Office, The Scottish Office,
Northern Ireland Office
Independent Oversight of the Prison
System
Every prison establishment in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland has a board of visitors,
comprising volunteers drawn from the local
community appointed by the Home Secretary
or Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
Boards are independent, monitoring
complaints by prisoners and concerns of staff,
and reporting as necessary to Ministers. In
Scotland, visiting committees to prisons are
appointed by local authorities; those to young
offender institutions are appointed by the
Secretary of State for Scotland.
Independent Prisons Inspectorates report
on the treatment of prisoners and prison
conditions, and submit annual reports to
Parliament. Each prison establishment is
visited about once every three years.
In England and Wales prisoners who fail to
get satisfaction from the Prison Service’s
internal request and complaints system may
complain to the Prisons Ombudsman, who is
independent of the Prison Service. In
Scotland, prisoners who exhaust the internal
grievance procedure may apply to the
independent Scottish Prisons Complaints
Commission.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners in the UK may write and receive
letters, be visited by relatives and friends, and
make telephone calls. Privileges include a
personal radio; books, magazines and
newspapers; watching television; and the
opportunity to buy goods from the prison
shop with money earned in prison. Offences
against prison discipline are dealt with by
prison governors, who act as adjudicators. In
England, Wales and Scotland measures to
counter drug misuse in prisons include
mandatory drug testing. Voluntary testing has
been piloted in Northern Ireland but there is
no mandatory programme. People awaiting
trial in custody have certain rights and
privileges not granted to convicted prisoners.
Prison Industries
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will help with their
resettlement into the community on release
and to secure a return which will reduce the
cost of the prison system. The main industries
are clothing and textile manufacture,
234
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
engineering, woodwork, laundering and
horticulture. A small number of prisoners are
employed outside prison, some in community-
based service projects.
Prison Education
Education is compulsory for young people in
custody below school leaving age; otherwise it
is voluntary. There are many facilities
available for prisoners to gain vocational
qualifications, and some prisoners study for
public examinations, including those of the
Open University (see p. 140).
Physical education is compulsory for young
offenders, but otherwise voluntary.
Opportunities are given for inmates to obtain
sporting proficiency awards. Inmates also
compete against teams from the local
community.
Healthcare
The Health Care Service for Prisoners is
responsible for the physical and mental
healthcare of all those in custody in England
and Wales. A Health Advisory Committee
provides independent medical advice to
government ministers and the Prison Service’s
Director General and Director of Health Care.
Its aim is to ensure that prisoners have access
to the same range and quality of services as do
the general public from the National Health
Service (NHS). In Scotland general medical
services are provided mainly by visiting
general practitioners. Psychiatric services are
bought in from local health boards responsible
for the NHS. In Northern Ireland healthcare
services are provided by medical and nursing
staff seconded from the Department of Health
and Social Services, supported by local
general practitioners. Specialist services are
provided by local health board trusts on a
contractual basis.
Early Release of Prisoners
Prisoners in England and Wales sentenced to
less than four years are released once they
have served half of their term. Those
sentenced to four years or more may be
considered for early release after serving half
of their sentence; if found unsuitable at that
stage for parole, they are released
automatically at the two-thirds point. The
Parole Board has the final decision on the
early release of prisoners sentenced to four
years or more, but less than seven years. In
other cases it makes a recommendation to the
Home Secretary about a prisoner’s suitability
for parole. Prisoners sentenced to a year or
more are released on licence to be supervised
until the three-quarters point of the sentence;
they can be recalled to prison if they present
an unacceptable risk to the public during that
time. If convicted of another offence
punishable with imprisonment and committed
before the end of the original sentence, a
released prisoner may have to serve all or part
of the original sentence outstanding at the
time the fresh offence was committed.
In Scotland similar arrangements apply
except that the Parole Board has the power to
release prisoners serving between four and ten
years from halfway through their sentence.
The release of prisoners serving more than ten
years needs the consent of the Secretary of
State. All prisoners sentenced to four years or
more are supervised from release until the end
of their sentence.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998
provides for:
• the release, in England and Wales, of
short-term prisoners on a home
detention curfew licence, enforced by
electronic monitoring, up to two
months before the normal date of
release;
• the imposition of a court sentence on
a sexual or violent offender which
includes an extended period of post¬
release supervision (also applicable in
Scotland); and
• supervision of recalled and returned
short-term prisoners following their
second release from detention.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving
terms of more than five days are eligible for
remission of half their sentence. Following the
enactment of the Northern Ireland
235
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
(Sentences) Act 1998 (realising a commitment
made in the Good Friday Agreement—see p.
16), prisoners serving sentences of five years
or more for scheduled offences may make
application for early release from custody.
Their eligibility for release rests with the
Sentence Review Commission, whose
members have been approved by the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland. The first group
of prisoners was released in September 1998.
Life Sentence Prisoners
The release on licence of prisoners serving
mandatory life sentences for murder may only
be authorised in England and Wales by the
Home Secretary on the recommendation of
the Parole Board. The Home Secretary is
required to release prisoners serving life
sentences for offences other than murder after
an initial period set by the trial judge if so
directed by the Parole Board. Similar
procedures apply in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland the Secretary of State reviews life
sentence cases on the recommendation of an
internal review body.
On release, life sentence prisoners remain on
licence for the rest of their lives and are subject
to recall if their behaviour suggests that they
might again be a danger to the public.
Preparation for Release
Prisoners may be released on temporary
licence for short periods but they are subject
to a rigorous risk assessment and are released
only for precisely defined and specific
activities which cannot be provided in prison
establishments.
Pre-release schemes in England and Wales
and in Scotland enable selected long-term
prisoners to spend some time before release in
certain units or prisons in order to help them
readapt to society and renew ties with their
families. Prisoners in such units work in paid
employment in the community and return to
the unit each evening. In Northern Ireland
there is also a pre-release system and, for long¬
term prisoners, extended Christmas and
summer home leave.
Professional support is given to offenders
after release (see below).
Probation
The locally organised probation service in
England and Wales supervises offenders in the
community under direct court orders and after
release from custody. It also advises offenders
in custody. All young offenders and all
prisoners in England and Wales sentenced to
12 months’ imprisonment and over are
supervised on release by the probation service,
or, in the case of certain young offenders, by
local authority social services departments.
A court probation order requires offenders
to maintain regular contact with their
probation officer, who is expected to supervise
them. The purpose of supervision under a
probation order is to secure the rehabilitation
of the offender, to protect the public and to
prevent the offender from committing further
offences. A probation order can last from six
months to three years; an offender who fails to
comply with any of the requirements can be
brought before the court again. The probation
service also administers some supervision
orders and supervises those subject to
community service orders and those released
from prison on parole.
HM Inspectorate of Probation has both an
inspection and advisory role, and also
monitors any work that the probation service
carries out in conjunction with the voluntary
and private sectors.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation,
community service and other community
disposals, and offenders subject to supervision
on release from custody.
In Northern Ireland the probation service is
administered by the government-funded
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Legal Aid
Someone who needs legal advice, assistance or
representation may be able to get help with legal
costs from the legal aid scheme. People who
qualify for help may have all their legal costs
paid for, or may be asked to make a contribution
towards them, depending on their means and,
in civil cases, the outcome of the case.
236
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Legal Advice and Assistance
Legal advice is available under the Legal
Advice and Assistance (‘Green Form’)
Scheme in England and Wales. Those whose
income and capital are within certain limits are
entitled to free advice from a solicitor on most
legal matters. The scheme provides initially
for up to three hours’ work for matrimonial
cases where a petition is drafted, and two
hours for other work. Similar schemes operate
in Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
At present civil legal aid may be available for
most civil proceedings to those who satisfy the
financial eligibility conditions and have
reasonable grounds for taking, defending or
being a party to proceedings. It may be
refused if, in the circumstances of the case, it
is considered unreasonable to grant it. Legal
aid is available on a non-means, non-merits
tested or means-tested-only basis to certain
categories of applicant in certain specified
proceedings regarding children. Payments to
lawyers are made through the Legal Aid
Fund, administered by the Legal Aid Board.
Scotland has a separate Legal Aid Fund,
administered by the Scottish Legal Aid Board.
In Northern Ireland legal aid is administered
by the Law Society for Northern Ireland.
An assisted person has some protection
against orders for costs being made against
them, and in certain limited circumstances the
successful unassisted opponent of a legally
aided party may recover costs from the Legal
Aid Fund. Where the assisted person recovers
or preserves money or property in the
proceedings, the Legal Aid Fund will usually
have a first call on that money or property to
recover money spent on the assisted person’s
behalf (the ‘statutory charge’).
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
In criminal proceedings in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland legal aid may be granted
by the court if it appears to be in the interests
of justice and if a defendant is considered to
require financial assistance. A contribution
towards the costs may be payable.
The Legal Aid Board makes arrangements
for duty solicitors to assist unrepresented
defendants in the magistrates’ courts.
Solicitors are also available, on a 24-hour
basis, to give advice and assistance to those
being questioned by the police. These services
are not means-tested and are free.
Where legal aid is granted for criminal
cases in Northern Ireland it is free. There is a
voluntary duty solicitor scheme at the main
magistrates’ court in Belfast.
Scotland
A duty solicitor is available to represent people
in custody on their first appearance in the
sheriff courts and the district courts without
enquiry into the person’s means. In other
cases, a person seeking legal aid in summary
criminal proceedings must apply to the
Scottish Legal Aid Board, which must be
satisfied that the expenses of the case cannot
be met by the applicant without undue
hardship, and that it is in the interests of
justice that legal aid is awarded. In solemn
proceedings the court decides on the
availability of legal aid and must be satisfied
that the accused cannot meet the expenses of
the case without undue hardship. Where legal
aid is granted to the accused in criminal
proceedings, he or she is not required to pay
any contribution towards expenses.
Administrative Reform
England and Wales
The Government announced its intention in
October 1997 to reform the legal aid system.
Its proposals include contracting for legal
services, in both criminal and civil cases, with
contracts specifying in advance what services
are being bought, and at exactly what prices.
The aim is to ensure that resources are
targeted at those who need them, to stop cases
going on too long, to trim costs and to cut
waste and duplication.
In March 1998 the Government published
a consultation paper (Access to Justice with
237
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Conditional Fees) on the proposed first stage of
the reform programme: extending the
availability of conditional fee arrangements,
removing legal aid from personal injury and a
number of other types of proceedings, and
setting up a transitional fund to support some
of the cases which would no longer receive
legal aid. The Government has since extended
conditional fee agreements (where the risk of
bringing a case is shared between litigants and
their lawyers) to all civil proceedings, other
than family cases. Other reforms will be the
subject of a White Paper.
Scotland
In October 1997 the Secretary of State
assumed the power to prescribe fixed
payments to solicitors for providing criminal
legal assistance. From October 1998 all
solicitors providing criminal legal assistance
must register with the Scottish Legal Aid
Board and conform to the Board’s code of
practice; a pilot scheme for public defence
solicitors employed by the Board will be
introduced to test alternative ways of
providing publicly funded legal
representation.
In April 1998, the Government issued a
consultation paper (Access to Justice—Beyond
the Year 2000) on reforming civil legal
assistance, reflecting its aim of ensuring that
legal aid is properly targeted and cost-effective.
Other Legal Advice
In some urban areas law centres provide free
legal advice and representation. They may
employ a salaried lawyer and many have
community workers. Much of their time is
devoted to housing, employment, social
security and immigration problems.
Advice is also available in Citizens Advice
Bureaux, consumer and housing advice
centres, and from voluntary organisations.

Introduction 239 Other Faith Communities 246
The Christian Community 241 Co-operation between Faiths 248
Everyone in the UK has the right to religious freedom without interference
from the community or the State. Religious organisations and groups may own
property, conduct their rites and ceremonies, run schools, and promote their
beliefs in speech and writing, within the limits of the law. There is no religious
bar to the holding of public office.
INTRODUCTION
Although the UK is predominantly Christian,
most of the world’s religions are represented
in the country. There are large Hindu,
Jewish, Muslim and Sikh communities, and
also smaller communities of Baha'is,
Buddhists, Jains and Zoroastrians, as well as
followers of new religious movements and
pagans. Non-religious alternatives for
humanists and atheists are offered by
organisations such as the British Humanist
Association and the National Secular Society,
although most humanists and atheists do not
belong to organised groups. Many Britons
would class themselves as agnostic.
There has been a fall in recent years in the
number of full-time ministers and the
number of adults recorded as members of
most of the larger Christian churches. At the
same time there has been significant growth
in a range of independent churches, and in
new religious movements. Surveys have also
revealed that many people who do not belong
to religious groups claim to be religious and
say they believe in God.
The British Social Attitudes Survey,
conducted annually by Social and
Community Planning Research, regularly asks
people about their religion. Whereas in 1989,
95% of respondents said they had a religion,
this had fallen to 91% by 1996. Adults’
religious attendance also fell over the period.
When asked how often they attended services
or meetings concerned with their religion in
1996, only 11% of adults said they attended
once a week or more, a fall from 13% in 1989.
The number of people in England and
Wales choosing to get married in venues
other than churches, chapels and register
offices increased significantly between
1994—95 and 1996-97. During this period,
religious weddings fell from 135,000 to
114,000; they accounted for 41.3% of all
weddings in 1996-97 compared with 44.6
in 1995-96. The change follows the 1994
Marriage Act, which introduced ‘approved
premises’ for solemnising marriage
ceremonies in addition to register offices,
churches and chapels.1
1 Approved premises (over 2,000 have been approved
since 1995) include, among others, hotels, stately homes
and historic houses.

Note: Respondents were asked ‘Apart from such
special occasions as weddings, funerals and
baptisms, how often nowadays do you attend
services or meetings connected with your
religion?’ However, those without a religion were
not asked the question.
Religious Freedom
Freedom of conscience in religious matters
began to be accepted in the 17th century. The
older laws discriminating against minority
religious groups were gradually enforced less
harshly and then finally repealed. Heresy
ceased to be a legal offence with the passage of
the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677, and
the Toleration Act 1688 granted freedom of
worship to Protestant minority groups, such as
the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers—
see p. 244) and other nonconformists.
In 1828 the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts gave nonconformist
Protestant Christians full political rights,
making it possible for them to be appointed to
public office. Roman Catholics gained political
rights under the Roman Catholic Relief Act
1829, and the Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled
Jews to become Members of Parliament. The
religious tests imposed on prospective students
and academic staff of the universities of Oxford,
Cambridge and Durham were successively
abolished by Acts of 1854,1856 and 1871.
Similar restrictions on the staff of Scottish
universities were formally removed in 1932.
The past 30 years have seen an increasingly
diverse pattern of religious belief and affiliation
in the UK. This has been linked both to
patterns of immigration and to new religious
directions among some of the indigenous
population. Social structures have been
gradually changing to accommodate this. For
example, arrangements are made at many places
of work to allow the members of the various
faiths to follow their religious observances.
Relations with the State
There are two established churches in the UK,
that is, churches legally recognised as official
churches of the State: in England the Anglican
Church of England, and in Scotland the
Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The two
Churches are, however, very different both in
organisation and in the nature of their
establishment (see pp. 241 and 243). The
Monarch is pledged by the coronation oath to
defend each Church in its respective territory.
There is no longer an established Church in
Wales or in Northern Ireland. Ministers of the
established churches, as well as clergy
belonging to other religious groups, work in
services run by the State, such as the armed
forces, national hospitals and prisons, and may
be paid a state salary for such services.
Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds. Religious
education in publicly maintained schools is
required by law, as is a daily act of collective
worship (see p. 128). Religious broadcasting is
subject to some legislative controls (see p. 281).
The State does not contribute to the general
expenses of church maintenance, although
some state aid does help repair historic
churches. In 1997-98, for instance, English
Heritage grant offers to churches totalled £10
million as compared with the £100 million
spent on the buildings by parishes. Assistance is
also given to meet some of the costs of repairing
cathedrals; £2 million was made available in
1997-98. This funding is not restricted to
Church of England buildings.
The Government shares with the Church
of England the upkeep of over 300 churches of
special architectural or historic importance
which are no longer required for regular
240
RELIGION
parish use and for which no alternative use can
be found. The contribution for the period
1995-98 was about £1.5 million. The Historic
Chapels Trust aims to preserve the redundant
chapels and places of worship of other
denominations and faiths, including
synagogues and temples, which are of
particular architectural or historic interest.
Involvement in Social Issues
Religious involvement in broader social issues
was highlighted in the Church of England’s
report Faith in the City: A Call for Action by
Church and Nation, published in 1985. This
led to the establishment of the Church of
England’s Church Urban Fund, an
independent charity which raises money to
enable people living in the most disadvantaged
urban areas to found local projects which
alleviate the effects of poverty on their lives.
By mid-1998 it had made grants totalling £28
million to 1,200 different projects.
The General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland debates annual reports from its
Committee on Church and Nation on social,
economic, and political matters; and, through
its Board of Social Responsibility, is the largest
voluntary social work agency in Scotland.
Organisations belonging to other churches
and religious groups are also closely involved
with a wide range of social issues (see, for
example, the Salvation Army, p. 244).
The Inner Cities Religious Council, based
in the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions, provides a forum
in which the Government and the faith
communities work together on issues relating
to urban regeneration. Chaired by a
government minister, the Council comprises
senior leaders of the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim,
Sikh and Christian faiths.
Unemployment and the Future of Work: an
Enquiry for the Churches—a major report
examining the problems of unemployment—
was published by the Council of Churches for
Britain and Ireland (see p. 245) in 1997.
The Sacred Land Project
The Sacred Land Project, launched in 1997,
plans to conserve or create over 2,000 sacred
sites in the UK during the next five years.
Sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund for
Nature, the Project works with local
communities, religious groups, and
conservation and environmental organisations
to reopen ancient pilgrim routes, create new
pilgrim paths, help restore old shrines and
sacred sites and develop sacred gardens. The
Project has the support of all the major
Christian churches, as well as most of the
other faiths practised in the UK.
One example of a sacred site is the
development of a disused railway line in
Walsingham, Norfolk, as an alternative route
for pilgrims visiting Anglican and Catholic
shrines dating from the 11th century.
Statistics on Religious Affiliation
There is no standard information about the
number of members of religious groups, since
questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses2 or for other
official purposes, except in Northern Ireland.
Each group adopts its own way of counting its
members (for example, some include all
members of their community, others only
active participants); the membership
figures in this chapter—in some cases
supplied by the religious groups
themselves—are therefore approximate.
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY
Church of England
The Church of England became the
established church during the Reformation in
the 16th century. Conflicts between Church
and State culminated in the Act of Supremacy
in 1534, which repudiated papal supremacy
and declared Henry VIII to be Supreme Head3
of the Church of England. The Church of
England’s form of worship was set out in
2 The feasibility of including a question on religious
affiliation in the 2001 Census is under consideration; a
White Paper is due later in 1998.

altered the title to ‘Supreme Governor’.
241
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
successive versions of the Book of Common
Prayer from 1549 onwards. The Church’s
relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation, since the Church’s privileges are
balanced by certain duties it must fulfil.
The Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’
of the Church of England and must always be
a member of the Church, and promise to
uphold it. Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans of cathedrals are appointed
by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime
Minister, although the Crown Appointments
Commission, which includes lay and clergy
representatives, plays a key role in the
selection of archbishops and diocesan bishops.
All clergy swear allegiance to the Crown. The
Church can regulate its own worship. The two
archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the
bishops of London, Durham and Winchester,
and 21 other senior bishops sit in the House of
Lords. Clergy of the Church, together with
those of the Church of Scotland, the Church
of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church,
may not sit in the House of Commons.
The Church of England is divided into two
provinces: Canterbury, comprising 30
dioceses, including the Diocese in Europe; and
York, with 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
divided into archdeaconries and deaneries,
which are in turn divided into about 13,000
parishes, although in practice many of these
are grouped together. There are, altogether,
about 13,300 Church of England clergy, men
and women, excluding mainland Europe. In
1996, 189,000 people were baptised in the
Church in the two provinces, excluding the
Diocese in Europe; of these, 141,000 were
under one year old, representing 23% of live
births. In the same year there were 43,000
confirmations. In 1995, 80,000 marriages were
solemnised in the Church of England. These
accounted for 66% of all marriages with
religious ceremonies, and 30% of all
marriages in England. Many people who
rarely, if ever, attend services still regard
themselves as belonging to the Church of
England.
At present the central governing and
legislative body is the General Synod, which
comprises separate houses of bishops, clergy
and lay members (but see below for planned
changes). Lay people are also involved with
church government in the parishes. The
Synod is the centre of an administrative
system dealing with missionary work, inter¬
church relations, inter-faith relations, social
questions, and recruitment and training for
the ministry. It also covers other church work
in the UK and overseas, the care of church
buildings and their contents, church schools
(which are maintained largely from public
funds), colleges and institutes of higher
education, and voluntary and parish
education.
The Church Commissioners are
responsible for managing the greater part of
the Church of England’s assets. The Prime
Minister appoints an MP to the unpaid post of
Second Church Estates Commissioner to
represent the Commissioners in Parliament.
In February 1998 the General Synod
approved proposals to overhaul the central
organisation and structure of the Church.
The number of Church Commissioners is
to be reduced by two-thirds and some of
their powers transferred to the recently
created Archbishops’ Council. The
Council, chaired by the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, will become the
Church’s central governing body. It is due
to start work in early 1999.
Apart from the Church Commissioners’
income, most of the remainder of the
Church’s income is provided by local
voluntary donations. The average annual
stipend of a Church of England priest is about
£15,210; additional benefits include free
housing (valued at £7,820) and a non¬
contributory pension.
The first women priests were ordained in
1994. Women priests can be appointed to all
offices in the Church, except those of
archbishop or bishop.
The Church of England reported a record
15% increase in the ordination of new clergy
between 1997 and 1998 (from 310 to 363).
Numbers of people in training for ordination
have also increased. There are at present over
1,200 people in training.
242
RELIGION
Other Anglican Churches
The Church of England is part of a worldwide
communion of Anglican churches. These are
similar in organisation and worship to the
Church of England and originated from it.
There are four distinct Anglican Churches in
the British Isles, each governed separately by
its own institutions: the Church of England,
the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Church of Ireland (which
operates in both Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic). The Church of Ireland was
disestablished in 1869 and the Church in
Wales in 1920.
The Anglican Communion comprises 38
autonomous Churches in the UK and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas, with a
total membership of about 70 million.
Links between the components of the
Anglican Communion are maintained by the
Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops,
which is held in Canterbury every ten years,
the last Conference having taken place in
1998. Presided over by the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Conference has no executive
authority, but enjoys considerable influence.
Issues debated at the 1998 Conference
included Third World debt, human sexuality,
human rights, and relationships with other
faiths.
The Anglican Consultative Council, an
assembly of lay people and clergy as well as
bishops, meets every two or three years to
allow consultation within the Anglican
Communion. The Primates Meeting brings
together the senior bishops from each Church
at similar intervals.
Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation in
the late 16th century and legislation enacted
by the Scottish Parliament. The Church’s
status was then consolidated in the Treaty of
Union of 1707 and by the Church of
Scotland Act 1921, the latter confirming its
complete freedom in all spiritual matters. The
Church appoints its own office bearers, and
its affairs are not subject to any civil
authority.
The adult communicant membership of the
Church of Scotland is over 660,000; there are
1,167 ministers serving in parishes. Both men
and women may join the ministry. The
Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of
government, that is, government by church
courts or councils, composed of ministers and
elders (presbyters), all of whom are ordained
to office, and also deacons. The 1,300
churches are governed locally by courts known
as Kirk Sessions, consisting of ministers and
elders. The next court is the Presbytery,
responsible for a geographical area made up of
a number of parishes; finally the General
Assembly, the supreme court, consisting of
elected ministers, elders and deacons. The
General Assembly meets annually under the
chairmanship of an elected moderator, who
serves for one year. The Monarch is normally
represented at the General Assembly by the
Lord High Commissioner.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland. They are
particularly active in the Highlands and
Islands.
Free Churches
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe those Protestant churches in the UK
which, unlike the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, are not established
churches. Free Churches have existed in
various forms since the Reformation,
developing their own traditions over the years.
Their members have also been known as
dissenters or nonconformists. Although this
historical experience has given these churches
a certain sense of shared identity, they
otherwise vary greatly in doctrine, worship
and church government. All the major Free
Churches—Methodist, Baptist, United
Reformed and Salvation Army—allow both
men and women to become ministers.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, with 380,269 adult full
members and a community of more than 1.2
million, originated in the 18th century
following the Evangelical Revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). The present church is
243
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
based on the 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. It has 3,660
ministers and student ministers and 6,678
places of worship.
MAYC, the youth service of the Methodist
Church, serves over 50,000 young people aged
13 to 25. Each year MAYC organises London
Weekend, one of the largest youth events in
Europe, bringing together dance, drama, rock
music and worship produced and performed
by youth groups from all over Great Britain.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in Britain in the 17th century. Today
they are mainly organised in groups of
churches, most of which belong to the Baptist
Union of Great Britain (re-formed in 1812),
with about 147,184 members, 1,735 ministers
and 2,116 places of worship. There are also
separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales
and Ireland, and other independent Baptist
Churches.
The third largest of the Free Churches is
the United Reformed Church, with some
95,000 members, 949 serving ministers and
1,740 places of worship. It was formed in 1972
following the merger of the Congregational
Church in England and Wales (the oldest
Protestant minority in the UK, whose origins
can be traced back to the Puritans of the 16th
century) with the Presbyterian Church of
England (a church closely related in doctrine
and worship to the Church of Scotland). In
1981 there was a further merger with the Re¬
formed Association of the Churches of Christ.
Alongside these churches are other historic
Free Church bodies. The Salvation Army was
founded in the East End of London in 1865 by
William Booth (1829-1912). Within the UK it
is second only to the Government as a
provider of social services. It is the largest
provider of hostel accommodation, offering
almost 4,000 beds every night. Other services
include work with alcoholics, prison
chaplaincy and a family tracing service which
receives 20,000 enquiries each year. The
Salvation Army in the UK is served by 3,150
officers (ordained ministers) and runs some
986 worship centres.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 17,500 adult members
and 9,000 attenders in the UK and 450 places
of worship, was founded in the middle of the
17th century under the leadership of George
Fox (1624—91). It has no ordained ministers
and no formal liturgy or sacraments. Silent
worship is central to its life as a religious
organisation. Emphasis is also placed on social
concern and peacemaking.
Among the other Free Churches are: the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the largest
Protestant church in Northern Ireland, where
it has around 300,000 members; the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales, with 49,750 members and
the largest of the Free Churches in Wales; and
the Union of Welsh Independents (40,755
members).
A recent development has been the rise of
Pentecostalism and the charismatic
movement. A number of Pentecostalist bodies
were formed in the UK at the turn of the
century. The two main Pentecostalist
organisations operating in the UK today are
the Assemblies of God (approximately 54,000
members, over 900 ministers and over 650
places of worship) and the Elim Pentecostal
Church. Since the Second World War
immigration from the Caribbean has led to the
growth of a significant number of Black
majority Pentecostalist churches.
In the early 1960s a Pentecostalist
charismatic movement began to influence
some followers in both the Church of England
and the Roman Catholic Church; it remains a
growing influence in both these churches, and
in the historic Free Churches. The Christian
‘house church’ movement (or ‘new churches’)
began in the early 1970s, when some
charismatics began to establish their own
congregations. Services were originally held in
private houses although many congregations
have now acquired their own buildings. The
movement, whose growth has been most
marked in England, is characterised by lay
leadership and is organised into a number of
loose fellowships, usually on a regional basis,
such as the Ichthus Fellowship in south-east
London.
Roman Catholic Church
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which ceased
to exist after the Reformation, was restored in
244
RELIGION
1850. The Scottish Roman Catholic Church’s
formal structure went out of existence in the
early 17th century and was restored in 1878.
However, throughout this period Catholicism
never disappeared entirely. There are now
seven Roman Catholic provinces in Great
Britain, each under an archbishop, and 30
dioceses, each under a bishop (22 in England
and Wales and eight in Scotland,
independently responsible to the Pope). There
are 3,319 parishes and about 4,800 priests
(only men may become priests). Northern
Ireland has six dioceses, some with territory
partly in the Irish Republic. About 10% of
British citizens describe themselves as Roman
Catholic.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great
importance to the education of its children
and requires its members to try to bring up
their children in the Catholic faith. Some
1.5% of the teachers in the UK’s 2,438
Catholic schools are members of religious
orders. These orders also undertake other
social work, such as nursing, childcare and
running homes for elderly people. There are
approximately 12,000 members of religious
orders in England, Scotland and Wales. Most
Catholic schools are maintained out of public
funds.
Other Churches
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians and Free Christians, whose origins
go back to the Reformation. The Christian
Brethren are a Protestant body organised in
their present form by J. N. Darby (1800—82).
There are two branches: the Open Brethren
and the Closed or Exclusive Brethren.
Many Christian communities founded by
migrant communities, including the
Orthodox, Lutheran and Reformed Churches
of various European countries, the Coptic
Orthodox Church and the Armenian Church,
have established their own centres of worship,
particularly in London. All these churches
operate in a variety of languages. The largest is
probably the Greek Orthodox Church, many of
whose members are of Cypriot origin. It is
represented in many cities throughout the UK.
There are also several other religious
groups in the UK which were founded in the
United States in the last century. These
include the Christadelphians, the Christian
Scientists, the Church of Jesus Christ of the
Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon Church), the
Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Seventh-Day
Adventists, and the Spiritualists.
Co-operation among the Churches
The Council of Churches for Britain and
Ireland (formerly the British Council of
Churches) is the main overall body for the
Christian churches in the UK. The Council
co-ordinates the work of its 32 member
churches and associations of churches, in the
areas of social responsibility, international
affairs, church life, world mission, racial
justice and inter-faith relations. The Council’s
member churches are also grouped in separate
ecumenical bodies, according to country:
Churches Together in England, Action of
Churches Together in Scotland, Churches
Together in Wales, and the Irish Council of
Churches.
The Free Churches’ Council, with 19
member denominations, includes most of the
Free Churches of England and Wales. It
promotes co-operation among the Free
Churches (especially in hospital chaplaincy
and in education matters).
The Evangelical Alliance, with a
membership of individuals, churches or
societies drawn from within 20
denominations, represents over 1 million
evangelical Christians.
Inter-church discussions about the search
for Christian unity take place internationally,
as well as within the UK, and the main
participants are the Roman Catholic,
Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist,
Reformed and Baptist Churches. In 1999 the
Church of England and the Methodist Church
will begin Formal Conversations on the move
towards unity. The Baptist Union, the
Moravian Church, the Roman Catholic
Church and the United Reformed Church will
have participating observers at the
Conversations. An informal trilateral
conversation between the Church of England,
the Methodist Church and the United
Reformed Church will also begin in 1999.

OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES
The Buddhist Community
The Buddhist community in the UK
embraces adherents both of British or Western
origin, and of South Asian and Asian
background. There are well over 500 Buddhist
groups and centres, including some 50
monasteries and temples. All the main schools
of Buddhism are represented. The Buddhist
Society, founded in 1924, promotes the
principles of Buddhism; it does not belong to
any particular school of Buddhism. The
Network of Buddhist Organisations represents
many of the various Buddhist teaching,
charitable, educational and cultural
organisations in the UK.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in the UK originates
largely from India. It is estimated that the
number of members is around 400,000 to
550,000, although some community
representatives suggest a considerably higher
figure. It is made up predominantly of
Gujaratis and Punjabis, the remainder
including Bengalis and Tamils. The largest
groups of Hindus are to be found in London,
Leicester, Birmingham, Bradford and Leeds.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was
opened in London in the early 1950s and there
are now over 150 mandirs in the UK, many of
which are affiliated to the National Council of
Hindu Temples (UK).
The Swaminarayan Hindu Temple, in
north London is the first purpose-built Hindu
temple in Europe, having a large cultural
complex with provision for conferences,
exhibitions, marriages, sports, and health
clinics. The Bhaktivedanta Manor Hare
Krishna temple, near Watford, is a place of
pilgrimage for thousands of Hindus from all
over the UK.
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of the
Norman Conquest and remained until
banished by royal decree in 1290. The present
community in the UK dates from 1656,
having been founded by Jews of Spanish and
Portuguese origin, known as Sephardim, who
now account for some 2% of the community.
Later more settlers came from Germany and
Eastern Europe; they are known as
Ashkenazim.
The Jewish community in the UK numbers
about 285,000 and is, after that in France, the
largest in Western Europe. The main groups
are to be found in the Greater London area
(182,700), Manchester and Salford (26,000),
Leeds (10,000), and Brighton and Hove
(5,300). About 70% are affiliated to
synagogues. Of these, most Ashkenazi Jews
(60%), acknowledge the authority of the Chief
Rabbi, while the more strictly observant (7%)
have their own spiritual leaders, as do the
Sephardim. The Reform movement (founded
in 1840), the Liberal and Progressive
movement (founded in 1901), and the recently
established Masorti movement, account for
most of the remaining 30% of synagogue
members.
Jewish congregations in the UK number
about 365. The Board of Deputies of British
Jews is the officially recognised representative
body for all these groups. Founded in 1760, it
is mainly elected by synagogues, but a growing
number of communal organisations are also
represented. The Board serves as the voice of
the community to both government and the
wider non-Jewish community.
Roughly two in every five Jewish children
aged 5 to 17 attend Jewish day schools, some
of which are supported by public funds. Over
100 agencies provide welfare services
throughout the community.
The Muslim Community
Recent estimates, based on extrapolations
from the 1991 census, suggest that the number
of Muslims in the UK is between 1 million
and 1.5 million, while estimates from within
the Muslim community itself suggest between
1.5 million and 2 million. Most originate from
Pakistan and Bangladesh, while sizeable
groups have come from India, Cyprus, the
Arab world, Malaysia and parts of Africa.
There is a growing number of British-born
Muslims, mainly the children of immigrant
parents, but including an increasing number
of converts to Islam.
246
RELIGION
There are over 600 mosques and numerous
community Muslim centres throughout the
UK. Mosques are not only places of worship;
they also offer instruction in the Muslim way
of life and facilities for educational and welfare
activities.
The first mosque in the UK was
established at Woking, Surrey, in 1890.
Mosques now range from converted houses in
many towns to the Central Mosque in
Regent’s Park, London, and its associated
Islamic Cultural Centre, one of the most
important Muslim institutions in the Western
world. The Central Mosque has the largest
congregation in the UK, and during festivals it
may number over 30,000. The Islamic
Cultural Centre’s activities include a weekend
school for children, a full-time nursery, a
public library and regular lectures, seminars
and conferences. Pastoral care includes free
legal advice, counselling, marriage and funeral
services, and prison and hospital visiting.
There are also important mosques and
cultural centres in Liverpool, Manchester,
Leicester, Birmingham, Bradford, Cardiff,
Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Many of the mosques are administered by
various local Muslim organisations, and both
the Sunni and the Shi’a traditions within Islam
are represented among the Muslim community
in the UK. Members of some of the major Sufi
traditions have also developed branches in
British cities. The Ismaili Centre in London
provides pastoral care and a place of worship
for Shi’a Imami Ismaili Muslims, whose
current Imam is Prince Karim Aga Khan.
The Muslim Council of Britain, founded in
1997, is a representative body of established
national and regional Muslim bodies as well as
local mosques, organisations and specialist
institutions. The Council aims to promote co¬
operation, consensus and unity on Muslim
affairs in the UK.
The Sikh Community
The large British Sikh community (estimates
range from 400,000 to 500,000) originates
mainly from India, and particularly from the
Punjab. The largest groups of Sikhs are in
Greater London, Manchester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Sikh
temples, or gurdwaras, cater for the religious,
educational, social welfare and cultural needs
of their community. A granthi is normally
employed to take care of the building and to
conduct prayers. The oldest gurdwara in
London was established in 1908 and the
largest is in Hounslow, Middlesex (to the west
of London). There are over 200 gurdwaras in
the UK.
Other Faiths
Small communities of other faiths include that
of the Jains, mainly living in London,
Leicester and Coventry. Jainism is an ancient
religion brought to the UK by immigrants
from India. (It is estimated that the number of
members is between 25,000 and 30,000.) A
Jain temple (or derasar) opened in Leicester in
1988. The Zoroastrian religion, or Mazdaism,
which originated in ancient Iran, is mainly
represented in the UK by the Parsi
community, whose ancestors left Iran in the
10th century and settled in north-west India
(estimates range from 5,000 to 10,000
members). The Baha’i movement originated
in 19th-century Iran; there are an estimated
6,000 Baha’is in the UK, organised in local
assemblies and administered by the National
Spiritual Assembly in London.
There are also several thousand members of
the Ahmadiyya movement in the UK, who
consider themselves Muslim, although they
are not generally recognised as such by the
Muslim community.
Rastafarianism emerged out of the back-to-
Africa movement in the West Indies early this
century, and arrived in the UK through
Jamaican immigration in the 1950s. It has no
single creed, but draws heavily on the Old
Testament.
New Religious Movements
A large number of new religious movements
are active in the UK. Sometimes popularly
referred to as cults, they have been
established since the Second World War and
often have overseas origins. Examples include
the Church of Scientology, the
Transcendental Meditation movement, the
Unification Church (popularly known as the
247
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
‘Moonies’) and various New Age groups.
INFORM (Information Network Focus on
Religious Movements), which is supported by
the main churches, carries out research and
seeks to provide objective information about
new religious movements. It was founded in
response to public concern about the activities
of some of these cults.
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FAITHS
A number of national organisations work to
promote good relations between different
religions in the UK. They include the Inter
Faith Network for the United Kingdom,
which links a wide range of organisations with
an interest in inter-faith relations, including
representative bodies from the Baha’i,
Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain, Jewish,
Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian faith groups.
The Network runs a public advice and
information service on inter-faith issues.
Other national organisations include the
Council of Christians and Jews, which works
for better understanding among members of
the two religions and deals with issues in the
educational and social fields.
Within each faith tradition there are
organisations and individuals working to
further good relations with other faiths. For
example, the Council of Churches for Britain
and Ireland (see p. 245) has a Commission on
Inter Faith Relations.
Faith and the Year 2000
The Christian Churches in the UK are
preparing for celebrations and events to mark
2000 years since the birth of Christ. The
Department for Culture, Media and Sport is
the Government’s leading department on
millennium matters; its committee on
churches and other faiths is advising
government, the Royal Households, the new
Millennium Experience Company and the
Millennium Commission (see p. 120) on
religious aspects of the celebrations.

The Government aims to bring the high culture of British national life to as
wide an audience as possible, not least through education, and to enthuse
sections of the population who have never, for example, experienced a live
performance or visited an art gallery. A Creative Industries Taskforce is
assessing the economic potential of the creative industries and seeking ways to
maximise this. The UK’s presidency of the European Union (EU) in 1998
emphasised the country’s close cultural links with its EU partners.
INTRODUCTION
Among the milestones of the UK’s artistic and
cultural heritage are the English renaissance in
drama and music, which began in the late 16th
century and inspired the plays of Shakespeare,
Marlowe, Ben Jonson and their
contemporaries, and the choral and
instrumental works of the Elizabethan and
Jacobean composers. Successive generations
have built upon their legacy and today British
playwrights and musicians attract large
international audiences. London’s artistic and
cultural life continues to be a magnet—the
daily choice of events in theatre, cinema, opera
house and concert hall, in museum and art
gallery, and in club and pub is unrivalled.
Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, Manchester and
Leeds are among other cities whose traditions
and amenities contribute to this vitality.
British radio and television drama and music,
and literary and arts criticism programmes,
enjoy a reputation second to none. In a recent
survey of overseas visitors to the UK, 18%
cited the performing arts as a reason for their
stay.
Cultural industries play an important part
in the UK economy. It is estimated that the
creative trades (including design, fashion,
graphics, advertising and journalism, as well
as crafts, music, film, radio, television and
publishing) employ 1.5 million people in over
1,000 businesses, with an annual turnover of
£50,000 million. This accounts for added
value of some £23,000 million, contributing
almost 4% of GDP.
Government Policy
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS), headed by its Secretary of
State, determines government policy and
administers expenditure on national museums
and art galleries in England, the Arts Council
of England (see p. 250), the British Library
and other national arts and heritage bodies.
Other responsibilities include the regulation of
249
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the film and music industries, broadcasting
and the press, the National Lottery and the
export licensing of antiques.
The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible
for the arts in their countries, including
national museums, galleries and libraries, and
their respective Arts Councils (see below).
The national museums and galleries are
urged to increase their resources—through
trading, for example. Government funds are
distributed to arts organisations indirectly,
through bodies such as the Arts Councils, the
British Film Institute (BFI) and Scottish
Screen. This helps to avoid political influence
over funding decisions by ensuring that
money is allocated by those best qualified to
do so. The DCMS budget of £912 million is
to be raised to £1,038 million by 2001-02,
with an extra £290 million to be spent on the
arts, media and sport—a real rise of 5.5%. Of
this, £100 million is to go to museums and
galleries, with provision for the removal of all
entry charges for national collections by 2001,
and £125 million to the performing and visual
arts. An independent body is to oversee and
monitor this expenditure, and to ensure that
those who receive it use it efficiently to
promote high standards.
The DCMS has set four themes for
nurturing creative activity and enjoyment:
• Access: ensuring that the greatest number
of people have the chance to experience
work of quality;
• Excellence: ensuring that government
support is used to strengthen the best,
and the most innovative, and the things
that would not otherwise find a voice;
• Education: ensuring that creativity is not
extinguished by the formal education
system and beyond; and
• Economic value: ensuring that the full
economic and employment impact
throughout the creative industries is
acknowledged and assisted by the
Government.
The Creative Industries Taskforce, set up
in 1997, includes members prominent in
business, publishing, design, music and film,
as well as ministers from government
departments, and establishes, for the first
time, a formal link between government and
the industries. It aims to improve education
and vocational training to prepare people for
careers in creative enterprises, to highlight
export promotion of creative goods and
services, and to secure worldwide
implementation of copyright agreements.
Arts Councils
The main channels for the distribution of
government grant-in-aid and lottery funding
to the visual and performing arts and literature
are the independent Arts Councils of England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Their
aims are to: develop and improve the
knowledge and practice of the arts; make them
more accessible to the public; and advise and
co-operate with government departments,
local authorities and other organisations.
The Arts Councils give financial assistance
and advice not only to the major arts centres
and opera, dance and drama companies, but
also to small touring theatre companies,
experimental performance groups and literary
organisations. They provide funds for training
arts administrators and help to develop other
sources of income, including sponsorship and
local authority support. They also promote
education, access and participation in
performing and visual arts and literature.
The Arts Council of England (ACE) is the
national strategic authority for the arts in
England and advocates the arts to government
and public. It provides the main funding for
the ten Regional Arts Boards (RABs), which
perform a strategic function in the British
regions. Other sources of money for the RABs
are the BFI and Crafts Council, as well as local
authorities.
In 1998 the ACE was reduced in size from
23 to 11 members (including the chairman).
Panels of experts from different arts areas
continue to advise the Council, but have lost
their decision-making powers. The reformed
ACE emphasises training and bridging the gap
between arts and schools, and ethnic arts in
large ethnic areas. It aims to find a better
balance between revenue funding for arts
organisations and for capital projects, and
stresses that permanency as an ACE client
250
CULTURE
cannot be taken for granted. Instead it will
introduce funding contracts ranging from one
to five years for all ACE clients.
Finance
In England planned central government
expenditure through the DCMS in 1998-99
amounts to £209 million for museums and
galleries; £198 million for the visual and
performing arts; £99 million for broadcasting
and the media (including film); and £90
million for libraries. The grant for the arts is
channelled mainly through the ACE, which
has a grant of £184.6 million in 1998-99, the
Crafts Council and the Pairing Scheme for the
Arts (see p. 252). In addition the Arts
Councils distribute National Lottery
proceeds, amounting to £250 million a year
(£220 million for the ACE).
Planned 1998-99 expenditure by the Arts
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland is respectively £26.9 million, £14.3
million and £6.7 million, the same as in
1997-98.
The Scottish Office is also providing £36.5
million for Scotland’s National Galleries and
Museums and National Library, while the
Welsh Office is giving some £18.4 million for
Wales’s National Museum and National
Library. Planned spending by the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland on the
National Museums (see p. 266) amounts to
£9.1 million in 1998-99.
National Lottery
The National Lottery Act 1998 aims to
refocus the Lottery’s good causes and free
more money for revenue funding. It set up the
National Endowment for Science, Technology
and the Arts (NESTA—see below). The New
Opportunities Fund, the new Lottery
distributor, aims, among other things, to
foster the arts in disadvantaged communities
(see also below).
By summer 1998, grants of some £1,645
million had been announced by the Arts
Councils and the Heritage Lottery Fund (see
p. 327) to arts projects. Major schemes include
£4.9 million for developing new premises for
Dance Base Ltd in the Grassmarket at
Edinburgh. The third round of the Arts for
Everyone (A4E) Main Programme in England
included awards of £360,000 to help
Vocaleyes set up a professional national
network of describing performances for blind
audiences, and £43,000 for the Out of Joint
company in a tour of schools to aid
understanding of A level Theatre Studies
texts. The A4E Express Programme gave
grants of between £500 and £5,000 primarily
to youth or voluntary groups and made 2,070
awards totalling £8.4 million between
November 1996 and May 1998, 65 of them
(valued at £297,000) to black and minority
ethnic groups. Awards for All, allowing
community organisations to apply for grants
of up to £5,000, has been launched by the four
Lottery distributors in Scotland, who include
the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) and Heritage
Lottery Fund.
The DCMS has allocated £5 million for a
New Audiences fund, to enable new, and
particularly young, audiences to enjoy the
many performing arts events open to
them:
• £2 million for projects to increase
audiences, including initiatives to
encourage the young, and £300,000
to three Sheffield theatres to test-
market various schemes, such as
cheap tickets to targeted groups and
‘pay what you can nights’;
• £1.75 million to touring companies,
to add extra venues to their schedule;
• £500,000 to orchestras to help them
bring music to inner cities and rural
communities; and
• £750,000 for a regional challenge
fund aimed at areas of cultural and
social deprivation.
NESTA
NESTA, described as ‘a National Trust for
Talent’, has an initial endowment of £200
million from the National Lottery and has
three objectives:
251
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
• to help talented individuals to develop
their full potential;
• to turn creativity into products and
services which can be put to good use in a
global market, so that the fruits of
innovation may be reaped in the UK; and
• to advance public appreciation of the
creative industries, science and
technology, and to change attitudes to
achieve wider recognition of the
importance of national creativity.
Local Authorities
Local authorities maintain about 1,000 local
museums and art galleries, and a network of
public libraries (see p. 268). They also provide
grant aid for professional and voluntary
bodies, including orchestras, theatres, and
opera and dance companies. They directly
promote cultural activity and contribute to the
cost of new or converted buildings for the
sector. In England net revenue support from
local authorities for 1997-98 was about £194
million.
The Corporation of London—the local
authority for the City of London—is the third
largest sponsor of the arts in the UK (the
largest are the Government and the BBC),
with a budget of nearly £45 million in
1997—98. The Corporation owns, funds and
manages the Barbican Centre (Europe’s
largest multi-arts and conference centre); is
principal patron of the London Symphony
Orchestra and the RSC; and funds and
manages the Guildhall School of Music and
Drama.
Business Sponsorship
Expenditure by business on arts sponsorship
rose by 20% in 1997, to a record £95.6
million. Lloyds Bank, BT, Marks & Spencer,
and Ernst & Young (who in autumn 1998
helped to bring an exhibition of Monet’s later
paintings to the Royal Academy) are major
providers. Canon UK is giving the Victoria
and Albert Museum £1.2 million over five
years to create a photography gallery (see
p. 265). The Pairing Scheme for the Arts,
managed by the Association for Sponsorship
of the Arts (ABSA) on behalf of the DCMS,
encourages firms in Great Britain to sponsor
cultural activity. Under the scheme,
government funding of between £500 and
£25,000 is awarded to arts organisations to
match the sponsorship from businesses. Since
1984, the scheme has contributed over £128
million (including £42 million from the
Government). Changes to the scheme in 1998
aim to spread money more widely and to
ensure that cash awards are targeted at
projects involving new sponsors. They include
a pilot category for 25% matching for certain
forms of ‘in kind’ sponsorship (valued at up to
£5,000); 50% matching for projects which
give exceptional access to the arts and are
aided by first-time sponsors; and 100% for the
first year of projects supported by first-time
sponsors who commit to a three-year contract.
At the Financial Times/ABSA awards in
1998, Edison Mission Energy won the First
Time Sponsor award for its support of Theatr
Clwyd, and NTL Cabletel the Single Project
prize for helping to organise the 100th
anniversary of Belfast’s Grand Opera House.
ABSA’s Creative Forum for Culture and
the Economy was set up to investigate ways to
broaden and expand the relationship between
business and the arts. There are 18 business
members, including Orange, Halifax and
NatWest Group pic. Under ABSA’s Business
in the Arts programme, companies and
individuals support arts organisations by
undertaking part-time voluntary placements
to help with business and marketing plans,
with IT, and with management problems.
Some £20 million from the Foundation for
Sport and the Arts, run by the Pools Promoters
Association, was used to benefit the arts in 1997
in the form of awards to organisations.
Cultural Diversity and Disability
Cultural Diversity
The ACE and the RABs see cultural diversity
as an expression of present-day British society.
They seek to ensure that opportunities exist
for all kinds of work, from such traditional
splendours as Indian classical dance to new
hybridic forms in music. They fund, for
252
CULTURE
example, leading companies, such as the
African people’s dance company, Adzido, and
the theatre group Talawa. They encourage the
growth of Caribbean carnival across the UK,
of which the most famous manifestation is the
annual Netting Hill Carnival—the largest
street festival in Europe.
Arts and Disability
The National Disability Arts Forum and other
national agencies are funded by the ACE, as
are creative organisations, such as Candoco, a
company of disabled and non-disabled
dancers. The ACE also supports an
apprenticeship scheme for disabled people in
major arts organisations, such as the RSC,
which is part of an initiative aimed at
increasing employment opportunities for
disabled people in the arts; and projects
involving disabled artists in schools. The SAC
supports Art Link and Project Ability, which
provide opportunities for people with
disabilities to develop their creativity.
The provision of access for disabled people
to arts buildings is a criterion for all grants
made from the National Lottery (see p. 120).
The DCMS has provided funds for the
ADAPT Trust, which advises on and provides
funds for improvements in access (physical or
sensory).
Arts Centres
Over 200 arts centres in the UK give people
the chance of seeing a range of specialist art
and of taking part in activities, especially
educational projects. Nearly all the centres are
professionally managed, while using the
services of volunteers. They are assisted
mainly by the Arts Councils, RABs and local
authorities, while the ACE funds two national
centres—the South Bank Centre and the
Institute of Contemporary Arts, both in
London. Many theatres and art galleries also
make available facilities for other arts.
The British Council
The British Council (see p. 94) promotes
British creativity internationally in the arts,
literature and design, and highlights Britain’s
cultural diversity. The Visiting Arts Office of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a joint
venture of the British Council with the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office, the Arts
Councils and the Crafts Council. It
encourages the inward flow to the UK of
arts from other countries.
Broadcasting
BBC radio and television and the independent
companies (see chapter 17) broadcast drama,
opera, ballet and music, as well as general arts
magazine programmes and documentaries.
These have won many international awards,
such as at the Prix Italia and Montreux
International Television Festivals.
Independent television companies also give
grants for arts promotion in their regions.
Broadcasting has created its own art forms—
nothing like the arts documentary or drama
series, for instance, exists in any other
medium.
In 1998 Harry Enfield won his third
comedy Silver Rose at Montreux for Harry
Enfield and Chums (BBC1), which also won the
special prize of the city of Montreux. In the
sitcom category, BBC2’s Operation Good Guys
won the Silver Rose and Channel 4’s Father
Ted won the Bronze Rose. The BAFT A
television awards for 1998 featured ITV’s
South Bank Show on Gilbert and George as
Best Arts Programme; Simon Russell Beale as
Best Actor in Channel 4’s A Dance to the
Music of Time\ Steve Coogan for Best Comedy
Performance in BBC2’s Tm Alan Partridge',
and Tony Marchant’s Holding On (BBC2) for
Best Drama Serial.
The BBC has five orchestras, which
employ many of Britain’s full-time
professional musicians. Each week it
broadcasts about 100 hours of classical and
other music (both live and recorded) on Radio
3 (see p. 276). BBC Radio 1 broadcasts rock
and pop music, and much of the output of
BBC Radio 2 is popular and light music. Of
the two national commercial radio stations
which broadcast music, Classic FM offers
mainly classical and Virgin Radio plays rock.
Much of the output of the UK’s local radio
stations is popular and light music.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Each summer the BBC presents and
broadcasts the BBC Promenade Concerts (the
‘Proms’), the world’s largest music festival, at
the Royal Albert Hall, in which it not only
sponsors works by British composers, but also
invites conductors, ensembles and soloists
from overseas. Programmes cater for the
widest musical tastes and in 1998 ranged from
a performance of the opera King Roger by the
20th-century Polish composer Karol
Szymanowski to the Ordo Virtutum by the
medieval German nun Hildegard of Bingen.
New British works in the 1998 season
included the London premieres of George
Benjamin’s Sometime Voices and Robin
Holloway’s Hymn to the Senses, as well as new
BBC commissions (for example, Julian
Anderson’s The Stations of the Sun), and
Simon Bainbridge’s setting of texts by the
Italian poet Primo Levi, Ad Ora Incerta, for
which he won the Grawemeyer Award from
the University of Louisville (Kentucky) in
1997, only the second Briton to do so.
Festivals
Some 500 professional arts festivals take place
in the UK each year. The annual Edinburgh
International Festival is held in August and
September and enjoys special prestige. The
1998 celebration featured 170 performances of
music, theatre, opera and dance (including a
performance of the Brahms Requiem, with the
Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the
Finnish soprano Karita Mattila and the Welsh
bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, renowned as a
‘superstar voice’). The Edinburgh Festival
Fringe, with programmes (including street
events) to suit all tastes and persuasions, takes
place alongside the main events. In 1998 there
were 1,309 shows at 64 venues and a total of
16,141 performances. Other Edinburgh events
(see also p. 258) include the International Film
and Television Festivals and the annual Book
Festival. The Clerical Medical Jazz Weekend,
held in Bath in May, focuses on the European
jazz scene and complements the Bath
Contemporary Music Weekend in the same
festival. The Cheltenham International Music
Festival in July features modern British works.
In 1998 the programme at the 51st Aldeburgh
Festival, founded by Benjamin Britten and
Peter Pears, ranged from 16th-century works
by Thomas Tallis, William Byrd and other
English renaissance masters, performed by the
Cardinally Musick, to a recital and lecture on
Schubert by the tenor Ian Bostridge and
works by the young composer David Sawer.
The Three Choirs Festival, founded in 1724
and the oldest choral festival in Europe, takes
place annually in Gloucester, Worcester or
Hereford.
Among other festivals catering for a
number of art forms are those at Canterbury,
Harrogate and Salisbury. The Royal National
Eisteddfod of Wales, Royal National Gaelic
Mod in Scotland, and Glasgow’s Celtic
Connections all celebrate national and folk
traditions. At the 1998 literary Charleston
Festival in Sussex, held in the house where
Duncan Grant, Vanessa Bell and David
Garnett took refuge during the First World
War, Eileen Atkins and Simon Callow gave
readings of the letters of Virginia Woolf and
Lytton Strachey. Summer rock festivals are
headed by Glastonbury (see also p. 258), with
world music at Womad (Reading).
Arts 2000
Arts 2000 is an Arts Council initiative which
celebrates the approach of the millennium.
Since 1992, one city, town or region in the
UK has been nominated, through
competition, to celebrate a particular art form,
with the help of Arts Council and matching
funds. Yorkshire and Humberside is the
Region of Photography and the Electronic
Image for 1998; and Glasgow, the City of
Architecture and Design for 1999.
DRAMA
Britain’s theatre tradition runs from
Shakespeare and his contemporaries through
Restoration playwrights such as Congreve to
Goldsmith and Sheridan in the 18th century,
Wilde in the 19th, and Shaw and Pinero in the
early 20th. Among successes by present-day
British writers are Copenhagen by Michael
Frayn; Things we do for Love by Alan
Ayckbourn; The Invention of Love by Tom
Stoppard; and Closer by Patrick Marber,
which won the Olivier Award for Best New
254
CULTURE
Play in 1998 and the London Evening
Standard award for Best Comedy. Musical
theatre has always been popular. Andrew
Lloyd-Webber’s latest musical, Whistle down
the Wind, opened in London in July 1998. His
Cats, planned with Cameron Mackintosh in
1980 and now in its 17th year, ranks as the
world’s most successful musical.
The RNT’s production of Shakespeare’s
King Lear won two Olivier awards in 1998: Ian
Holm for Best Actor and Richard Eyre for Best
Director. Christopher Hampton’s translation
from the French of Yasmina Reza’s The
Unexpected Man (with Eileen Atkins and
Michael Gambon) followed his version of the
same author’s Art, which has played to capacity
houses since it opened in London in 1996 and
has won an Olivier Award for Best Comedy
(1997) and a Tony Award (1998) for Best Play.
Other recent successes for British actors and
directors include Ian McKellen in Ibsen’s An
Enemy of the People at the RNT and the Cheek
by Jowl production of Shakespeare’s Much Ado
about Nothing (with Saskia Reeves and Matthew
Macfadyen). Cheek by Jowl, a touring company
(especially to Russia) under its directors Declan
Donnellan and Nick Ormerod, has been
applauded for its productions of British and
European classics, with the help of ACE and
British Council grants.
Some of the UK’s 300 professional theatres
are privately owned, but most belong either to
the municipality or to non-profit-making
organisations. Over 40 of these have resident
theatre companies receiving subsidies from the
Arts Councils and RABs. In summer open-air
theatres include the Regent’s Park in London
and the Minack, on a clifftop near Land’s End
in Cornwall. Most theatres are commercially
run and rely on popular shows and musicals to
be profitable. By contrast, companies funded by
the Arts Councils tend to offer a mix of
traditional and experimental productions.
Innovative work is often staged in smaller
‘fringe theatres’ (perhaps using rooms in pubs)
in London and other cities.
London
London has about 100 theatres, 15 of them
permanently occupied by subsidised
companies. These include:
The 300-seat Almeida Theatre in Islington
(north London) has achieved great success
since 1990 under its joint artistic directors
Ian McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent,
presenting landmark productions of world
theatre, and attracting leading British and
overseas players (who work for minimum
wages) and enthusiastic audiences. Even
with full houses it can earn only 40% of its
required income through the box office. It
receives a £420,000 subsidy from the
London Arts Board and benefits from
sponsorship from the American
communications company AT&T.
Productions have included the Medea of
Euripides, with Diana Rigg, which later
transferred to London’s West End and to
Broadway and won her the Evening
Standard Drama Award and a Tony
Award (1994) in New York; Chekhov’s
Ivanov (with Ralph Fiennes); Pirandello’s
Naked (with the Oscar-winning French
actress Juliette Binoche); David Hare’s
The Judas Kiss (with Liam Neeson); and
Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh, with
another Oscar-winner, the American actor
Kevin Spacey.
British successes in New York in 1998
included Natasha Richardson and Scottish
actor Alan Gumming, stars of Cabaret on
Broadway, who won Tony Awards for Best
Leading Actress and Actor in a Musical.
Cabaret, directed by Londoner Sam
Mendes, also took the prize for Best
Revival of a Musical. The stage version of
The Lion King, with music and lyrics by
Elton John and Tim Rice, won two
awards: for Best Musical, and for Best
Scenic Design (to Richard Hudson).
Derek Jacobi won the Hamburg
Shakespeare prize in 1998.

performs work by new playwrights and
will be returning to the renovated Royal
Court Theatre in Sloane Square in
September 1999.
West End theatres enjoyed their third
busiest year on record in 1997: the average
attendance for each performance increased to
737. Total West End takings were up £17
million to just over £246 million.

In 1998 the second season of Shakespeare’s
Globe Theatre, rebuilt near its original site,
began with The Merchant of Venice, Two
Gentlemen of Verona and As You Like It. The
achievement of the late Sam Wanamaker, who
launched and sustained the campaign, and
raised funds, for its construction, was
recognised by a posthumous Ambassador for
London award in 1997.
provides an international stage for large-scale
productions; its Traverse Theatre occupies a
home custom-built for new writing.
Regional stage companies with major
reputations include the Citizens’ Theatre,
Glasgow; the Royal Exchange, Manchester
(now restored after destruction by an IRA
bomb in 1996—its foyer is lit by shafts of
aquamarine light filtered through three glass
domes); Bristol Old Vic; the Festival Theatre,
Chichester; the Crucible, Sheffield; the
Belgrade, Coventry; and the Nottingham
Playhouse. Theatr Clwyd, based in Mold
(Flintshire), under Terry Hands, tours and
benefits from Lottery funds; one of its recent
successes has been Rape of the Fair Country,
adapted from the novel by Alexander Cordell.
In addition, the largest regional theatres
receive visits from the RNT or the RSC,
which has three auditoriums at Stratford-
upon-Avon.
Theatre for Young People
Companies such as Pop-Up, Oily Cart and
Quicksilver present plays specially written for
children and tour throughout the UK. The
Young Vic in London launched its own
resident repertory company in 1998 with Tim
Supple’s production of Shakespeare’s Twelfth
Night. Contact Theatre Company in
Manchester and the Sherman in Swansea
stage plays for young people. Most regional
repertory theatres also mount productions for
younger audiences, and concessionary ticket
prices are generally available.
There are more than 500 youth theatres in
England alone; both the National Youth
Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow offer early acting
opportunities to young people.
Regional Theatres
Older theatres outside London include the
Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne, which
dates from the 18th century; and the Theatre
Royal, Bristol and the Grand Opera House,
Belfast, which date from the 19th century.
Edinburgh’s rebuilt and restored Empire—
now the Edinburgh Festival Theatre—
Dramatic Training
Training for actors, directors, lighting and
sound technicians and stage managers is
provided mainly in drama schools, among
them the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art
(RADA), the Central School of Speech and
Drama, the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art (LAMDA), and the Drama
256
CULTURE
Centre (all in London); the Bristol Old Vic
School, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama (Glasgow) and the Welsh College
of Music and Drama (Cardiff). A number of
universities and colleges offer degree courses
in drama.
Circus
Since the 1970s development in circus arts
(which originated in London in the 1770s)
overseas has rekindled interest in the UK; 100
young people are to train as acrobats and
trapeze artists for the live show to take place
six times a day in the Millennium Dome.
Training and performance benefit from
Lottery funding. The Circomedia Academy of
Circus Arts and Physical Theatre in Bristol
and Zippo’s Academy of Circus Arts at
Winchester were both founded in 1993.
MUSIC
In 1997-98 more than 200 million music
albums and 85 million singles were sold in the
UK, representing a combined increase in units
sold of some 2% on the previous year. Gross
overseas earnings by the UK music industry
were £1,200 million, of which more than half
came from the sales of recordings, and the net
surplus on overseas trade was well over £500
million. The industry employs about 115,000
people. In January 1998 the Government set
up the Music Industry Forum, to bring
together participants from all sectors of the
business to discuss matters such as CD piracy,
digital distribution of sound recordings and
music education.
Orchestral and Choral Music
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are
promoted every year in large towns and cities.
In central London are the Royal Festival Hall
in the South Bank Centre, alongside the
Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room,
which accommodate smaller-scale
performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre; see p. 256); the Royal Albert
Hall in Kensington (see p. 254); the Wigmore
Hall, a recital centre; and St John’s, Smith
Square. Birmingham has the Symphony Hall,
while the 2,400-seat Bridgewater Hall is for
Manchester’s Halle Orchestra; the 2,235-seat
Waterfront Hall in Belfast opened in 1997.
Among the leading symphony orchestras in
London are the London Symphony, under
their conductor Sir Colin Davis, and the BBC
Symphony, under Andrew Davis. The Dutch
conductor Bernard Haitink is president of the
London Philharmonic, whose composer in
residence is Harrison Birtwistle. Orchestras
outside London include the Royal Liverpool
Philharmonic, the City of Birmingham
Symphony (until 1998 under Sir Simon
Rattle), the Ulster Orchestra, the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra and the BBC
National Orchestra of Wales. British orchestras
often attract resident conductors from overseas.
Chamber groups, such as the Academy of St
Martin-in-the-Fields and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra, perform modern as well as
classical works. Specialised ensembles, with a
concern for authenticity, include the Orchestra
of the Age of Enlightenment, the Academy of
Ancient Music (under Christopher Hogwood)
and the English Concert (under Trevor
Pinnock), which have been crucial in restoring
to public notice, and popularity, a baroque and
classical repertoire until recent times almost
consigned to oblivion, including, for example,
lesser-known works by Handel and the music
of his English contemporaries, such as William
Boyce. The popularity of such composers as
John Tavener {Song for Athene), Oliver
Knussen and Judith Weir has demonstrated
widespread appreciation of modern music.
British singers continue to enjoy
international success: the sopranos Lynne
Dawson, Joan Rodgers, and Amanda Roocroft,
for example, noted interpreters of 18th-
century music; the mezzos Felicity Palmer
(famed for the precision of her singing) and
Catherine Wyn-Rogers; the counter-tenor
Michael Chance; the tenors Philip Langridge
and Anthony Rolfe Johnson; and the bass John
Tomlinson. Successful instrumentalists
include the percussionist Evelyn Glennie, who
inspires pieces from modern composers, the
violinist Tasmin Little, the oboist Nicholas
Daniel, and the clarinettist Michael Collins.
Almost all the leading orchestras maintain
their own choral societies. The English
257
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
tradition of ecclesiastical choral singing is
exemplified by choirs such as those of King’s
College Chapel, Cambridge, and Christ
Church Cathedral, Oxford. The choir at
Westminster Cathedral is known for its more
astringent tone (based on that of the Sistine
Chapel at Rome). Male-voice choirs are an
essential part of the Welsh tradition.
Two celebrated events in the musical
calendar are the Leeds International
Pianoforte Competition for young pianists and
the biennial Cardiff Singer of the World
Competition, which attracts outstanding
young singers from all countries.
Pop and Rock Music
Hundreds of hours of pop and rock music are
broadcast through BBC and independent
television and radio stations. It is by far the
most popular form of music in the UK and
ranges from dance to heavy metal.
British groups are often at the forefront of
new developments and are as famous abroad as
they are at home. The Spice Girls have
become a £300 million industry, their two
chart-topping albums having made 40 million
sales worldwide. Their film SpiceWorld: the
Movie, released in December 1997, had earned
£50 million up to June 1998 (£13 million in
the UK). In the same month they embarked
on a two-month United States tour; 13,000
tickets for their Madison Square Garden
concert in New York were sold in 12 minutes.
Other all-girl groups include All Saints
(topping the charts in May 1998 with the hit
singles ‘Under the Bridge’ and ‘Lady
Marmalade’) and Cleopatra. At the
Glastonbury festival in June 1998 the Welsh
group Catatonia (their latest hit album,
International Velvet), and their singer Cerys
Matthews, were received with enthusiasm, as
were the groups Blur, with their
vocalist/keyboardist Damon Albarn, and
Embrace. Another Welsh group, the
Stereophonies, gave the first rock concert at
Cardiff Castle (‘Cwmaman Feel the Noize’) to
a capacity audience in celebration of the EU
summit.
The 1998 Ivor Novello awards for popular
songwriters brought two trophies to Elton
John for ‘Candle in the Wind’ (sung at the
funeral of Diana Princess of Wales)—for its
powerful message and for its sales (£83
million in royalties, donated to charity, so far).
The band Radiohead won Best Contemporary
Song Prize for ‘Karma Police’ and their hit
song ‘Paranoid Android’ was voted Best Song
Musically and Lyrically. ‘Picture of You’ from
the film Bean was voted Best Original Song
for a Film. Richard Ashcroft of Verve was
voted Songwriter of the Year and Morrissey,
who has pioneered alternative pop/rock, won
the award for the Most Outstanding
Contribution to British Music.
Through the Music Industry Forum (see
p. 257), which includes Mick Hucknall, lead
singer of Simply Red, the Government
proposes to allow would-be rock performers to
opt out of the standard New Deal programme
(see p. 155) by joining a special scheme to help
them become professional musicians.
Jazz
Several works by George Gershwin, whose
music encapsulated the Jazz Age, were
performed at the 1998 Proms (see p. 254).
The summer 1998 Jazz at the Barbican
concerts, featuring artists from the United
States, were largely sold out. The Edinburgh
International Jazz and Blues Festival (held in
July/August), one of several in the UK,
features the world’s leading jazz musicians.
Among British jazz groups, the Joe Robinson
Quintet and the Simon Gilby Quartet are
known for their original compositions, while
the young saxophonist Johnny Lippiett and
trumpeter Gerard Presencer are hailed as
exciting new figures on the British jazz scene.
There is also a jazz radio station, Jazz FM,
which broadcasts in London and in the north
west of England.
Training
Professional training in music is given at
universities and conservatoires. The leading
London conservatoires are the Royal Academy
of Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and
Trinity College of Music. Outside London are
the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow, the Royal Northern
258
CULTURE
College of Music in Manchester, the Welsh
College of Music and Drama in Cardiff, and
the Birmingham Conservatoire.
Other Educational Schemes
In 1998 the Government announced the
formation of the Youth Music Trust, to
develop the musical skills of the young, with
£10 million a year from the National Lottery,
and donations from music charities and
companies involved in the music business. It is
designed to halt and reverse the decline in
musical instrument and choral teaching in
schools, especially for 7—14 year olds. Music is
a foundation subject in the National
Curriculum (see chapter 10).
The national youth orchestras of Great
Britain, Scotland, Ulster and Wales, and other
youth orchestras have established high
standards. Nearly a third of the players in the
European Community Youth Orchestra come
from the UK. There is also a National Youth
Jazz Orchestra and a network of other youth
jazz orchestras and wind bands.
OPERA
London is a centre of world-class opera and
the UK exports its operatic talent throughout
the world (see p. 257). In 1998, by popular
demand, English National Opera (ENO) at the
Coliseum revived Nicholas Hytner’s
triumphant production of Handel’s Xerxes for
the fourth time since its first staging in 1985
(and its success on the ENO’s tour of Russia
in 1994). This season the leading part was
taken, to acclaim, by the company’s principal
mezzo, Sarah Connolly. Another popular
revival in 1998 was David Pountney’s
production of Purcell’s The Fairy Queen. A
new work by a British composer performed by
ENO in 1998 was Gavin Bryars’s Doctor Ox's
Experiment.
The Royal Opera House (ROH) at Covent
Garden is being restored and enlarged (for
completion in December 1999) at a cost of
£213.8 million, with the aid of £78.5 million
in Lottery funding and a £100 million
development appeal. The report by Sir
Richard Eyre on the future of lyric theatre in
London, published in July 1998, criticises past
ROH management and says that fundamental
changes are needed if the ROH is to provide
proper value for the public money it receives.
The Government has accepted some of the
conclusions of the report and is consulting on
its findings.
Scottish Opera has regular seasons at the
Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly
in Scotland and northern England. Welsh
National Opera presents seasons in Cardiff
and tours in England and Wales. Leeds-based
Opera North tours mainly in the north of
England. Opera in Northern Ireland is
presented at the Grand Opera House, Belfast,
by, among others, the local company
Castleward Opera.
An opera season for which international
casts are specially assembled is held every
summer at Glyndebourne in East Sussex.
This is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera, using casts
drawn from the chorus of the festival season.
Highlights of 1998 have been Handel’s
Rodelinda, under the American/French
conductor William Christie (with German
counter-tenor Andreas Scholl and English
mezzo Louise Winter) and John Cox’s staging
of Richard Strauss’s Capriccio, under Andrew
Davis (with New Zealand soprano Kiri Te
Kanawa and Canadian-born baritone Gerald
Finley).
A revived D’Oyly Carte Opera Company,
which devotes itself to the operas of Gilbert
and Sullivan, was seen in London for the first
time in three years, and gave eight
performances of The Mikado at the Royal
Festival Hall.
DANCE
Subsidised dance companies include the Royal
Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet, English
National Ballet, Northern Ballet Theatre,
Rambert Dance Company, Siobhan Davies
Dance Company and Shobana Jeyasingh
Dance Company, which rank among the
world’s leaders. The Lottery-funded
rebuilding of London’s Sadlers Wells theatre,
at a cost of over £38 million, has created a
purpose-designed dance theatre (to seat up to
1,600) that is also suitable for modern and
259
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
baroque opera. During the restoration of
Covent Garden (see p. 259) the Royal Ballet
uses other London venues. Their 1998
summer season at the Coliseum included
Minkus’s La Bayardere, Anthony Dowell’s
production of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake, and
Massenet’s Manon, and the principal dancers
included Darcey Bussell, Deborah Bull, Sylvie
Guillem, Viviana Durante, Jonathan Cope and
Bruce Sansom.
In 1998 the ACE’s dance panel awarded
some £750,000 (including an extra £70,000 to
help remedy underfunding) to independent
dance companies, such as the Jonathan Burrows
group, the Michael Clark company and
Ricochet Dance Company. It also supported a
showcase of British work, British Dance: edition
'98, which brought over 200 international
promoters to Newcastle upon Tyne.
Training
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by specialist
schools, which include the Royal Ballet School,
the Central School of Ballet, the Northern
School of Contemporary Dance (Leeds) and
the London Contemporary Dance School;
these, with many private schools, have helped
to raise British dance to its present standard.
All government-funded dance companies
provide dance workshops and education
activities. Phoenix Dance Company’s ‘Urban
Exchange’ and English National Ballet’s
‘Striking a Balance’, for example, have won
awards for their projects. Ludus Dance
Company, in Lancaster, works mainly with
young people. The National Youth Dance
Company gives a chance for young people to
work with professionals.
FILMS
In 1997, some 110 feature films were shot in the
UK, with a total production outlay of £465
million. Of these, 46 were wholly financed from
overseas or were co-productions with British
partners. The number of films which could be
classified as British—wholly or partly financed
by British companies or organisations—and
were made in the UK or abroad totalled 102, the
highest number in the EU. British consumers
spent about £160 million on British films in
1997; when estimated overseas receipts of £545
million and inward investment of £217 million
are taken into account, total industry revenues
come to some £922 million. In spring 1997 the
British movie share of the British box office was
about 9.5%; in early 1998 it was running at
23%. With admissions increasing, thanks partly
to the success of multiplex cinemas (in Great
Britain in autumn 1997 some 1,800 screens were
operating at about 460 sites), total box office
takings in 1997 topped £512 million, with total
admissions of 137.3 million, an increase of
nearly 11% on 1996. Government support for
the film industry ensures a 100% tax write-off
on the production and acquisition costs for
British movies with budgets of up to £15
million. The British film industry gives direct
employment to about 33,000 people, 21% of
whom are actors, directors and producers, and
42% of whom are women.
The Full Monty has become the highest-
earning British film of all time: it cost £1.6
million to make and by April 1998 had
earned £140 million. In March 1998 it
won an Oscar for Anne Dudley, for Best
Original Musical or Comedy Score. In
April, it secured British Academy Film
(BAFTA) Awards for Best Film, Best
Leading Actor (Robert Carlyle), Best
Supporting Actor (Tom Wilkinson) and
the Audience Award. Nil by Mouth won a
BAFT A award for Best Original

CULTURE
Other critically praised, UK-financed films
made in 1996—97 included:
• Bean, directed by Mel Smith (with
Rowan Atkinson), which cost £2 million
to make and had taken over ^60 million
at the box office before it had opened in
the United States;
• A Life less Ordinary, directed by Danny
Boyle (with Ewan McGregor and
Cameron Diaz);
• Different for Girls, directed by Richard
Spence (with Rupert Graves, Steven
Mackintosh and Miriam Margolyes);
• My Son the Fanatic, directed by Udayan
Prasad (screenplay by Hanif Kureishi),
with an ACE grant; and
• Guru in Seven, directed and written by
Shani Grewal (with Saeed Jaffrey).
Films made with a significant amount of
British finance and using British locations and
personnel, included:
• Wilde, directed by Brian Gilbert (with
Stephen Fry and Jude Law), which cost
£6.4 million, with a £1.5 million ACE
grant;
• Regeneration, directed by Gillies
MacKinnon (with James Wilby and
Jonathan Pryce), which cost £3.2 million,
with grants from the SAC (£1 million),
the Glasgow Film Fund and the Scottish
Film Production Fund; and
• The Winter Guest, directed by Alan
Rickman (with Emma Thompson and
Phyllida Law), with grants from the SAC
and the Scottish Film Production Fund.
Five feature films were made wholly or partly
in Northern Ireland during 1997, with over
£ 1 million in Lottery grants from the Arts
Councils of England and Northern Ireland.
Animation
At the British Animation Awards in 1998
Joanna Quinn won the Best Children’s Special
award for her Channel 4 film Famous Fred,
which had already earned her an Oscar
nomination. A previous Oscar winner, Daniel
Greaves, won Favourite Film and New
Perspective awards for his BBC film
Flatworld. Carl Gorham’s series Stressed Eric
for BBC2 won International Co-production
and Best Scenario prizes. Sarah Cox’s Three
Ways to Go won the award for Best Film
under Ten Minutes.
Government Support
The Government supports a number of
organisations which promote the film
industry. Its largest grants go to the BFI (see
p. 262) and to Scottish Screen (see p. 262).
Major grants go to three other organisations:
The British Film Commission (BFC)
markets the UK film and television
production service industry to overseas
producers, to attract inward investment.
Projects helped by the BFC since it was set up
in 1992 (such as Tomorrow Never Dies and
Saving Private Ryan) have contributed £1,150
million to the UK production industry and
the economy. The BFC also works alongside
the UK Film Commission Network, which
comprises 24 area or city offices. The growth
of this network over six years illustrates the
recognition by local and central government of
the effectiveness of such organisations in
stimulating more production in the UK.
British Screen Finance (BSF), a private
sector company, provides loans for new film¬
makers with commercially promising
productions who have difficulty in attracting
funds. Loans are for the production of low-
and medium-budget films involving largely
British talent. Total commitment to date on
over 140 films is £46.8 million. Successful
recent films supported by BSF include Sliding
Doors and Love and Death on Long Island.
The European Co-Production Fund, a
UK initiative, offers loans of up to 30% of a
film’s budget, enabling British producers to
collaborate in the making of films in Europe.
It has committed £14.4 million to about 50
feature movies, with a total value of some
£135 million. Recent notable pictures made
with help from the Fund include Eileen
Atkins’s adaptation of Virginia Woolfs Mrs
Dallorvay (with Vanessa Redgrave) and the
Belgian film Ma Vie en Rose.
261
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Government has proposed a unified
film body bringing together the BFI, BFC,
BSF and ACE Lottery Film Fund. It is the
intention that this will be in place during 1999.
Reflecting its support for the trend of
international co-productions, the UK has seven
official bilateral co-production agreements
(with Australia, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, New Zealand and Norway), and has
ratified the Council of Europe Convention on
Cinematographic Co-Production.
British Film Institute (BFI)
The development of film, video and television
as art forms is promoted by the BFI, and in
Scotland by Scottish Screen and in Northern
Ireland by the Northern Ireland Film
Commission (NIFC; see below).
The BFI runs the National Film Theatre
(NFT) in London and the National Film and
Television Archive, which contains over
350,000 films and television programmes,
including newsreels and animation, feature and
short films dating from 1894. The BFI also has
the world’s largest film and television library,
with international collections of books,
periodicals, scripts, stills and posters.
BFI activities on the South Bank include the
Museum of the Moving Image, which traces the
history of film and television, and the NFT.
The NFT has three cinemas showing films of
historical, artistic or technical interest, and is
unique in offering regular programmes
unrestricted by commercial considerations. In
1997-98 about 2,000 films, television and video
programmes were shown, attracting attendances
of over 200,000. In November each year the BFI
hosts the London Film Festival at the NFT and
in London’s West End, at which some 250 new
pictures from all over the world are screened. In
1997,110,000 people attended Festival
screenings.
The BFI supports a network of regional
film theatres across the UK, and gives grants
to arts, media and movie organisations
through the RABs (see p. 250).
Scottish Screen
Scottish Screen, set up in 1997, took on the
functions of four former film agencies. It is
concerned with the film industry and with
film culture and it:
• supports regional film theatres, promotes
and provides educational materials and
administers the Scottish Film and
Television Archive;
• offers financial help to develop film
scripts;
• advises on suitable locations for film-
making in Scotland; and
• provides training for production and
technical workers.
Northern Ireland Film Commission
In 1997 the NIFC was set up to promote films
produced in the Province, to encourage film¬
makers to use Northern Ireland locations and
to attract private sector investment in its film
industry.
Children’s Film
The Children’s Film and Television Foundation
produces and distributes entertainment films for
children, shown largely through video and
television. The Children’s Film Unit makes
features, and short films and videos, and runs
weekly workshops on all aspects of film-making.
The Unit caters for about 80 children at any
time and has produced 18 features. The
Northern Ireland Film Commission supports
Cinemagic, an award-winning international film
festival for young people.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industries. It
offers postgraduate and short course training
for directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. The School
enrols 50-60 full-time students a year and
about 850 on short course programmes. The
London International Film School, the Royal
College of Art, and some universities and
other institutions of higher education also
offer courses in film production.
262
CULTURE
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Cinemas showing films to the public must be
licensed by local authorities, which have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of
children to unsuitable films, and may prevent
the showing of any film. In assessing films the
authorities normally rely on the judgement of
an independent non-statutory body, the
British Board of Film Classification (BBFC),
to which all films must be submitted. It does
not use any written code of censorship, but
can require cuts to be made before granting a
certificate; on rare occasions, it refuses a
certificate.
Films passed by the BBFC are put into one
of the following categories:
• U (universal)—suitable for all;
• PG (parental guidance), in which some
scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at premises to which no one under 18 is
admitted—for example, licensed cinema
clubs.
Videos
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to
that for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of its
designation—for example, to sell or hire a
video classified 18 to a person under 18.
MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES
About 100 million people a year visit the UK’s
2,500 or so museums and galleries open to the
public, which include the major national
collections, about 1,100 independent
museums, and 800 museums receiving
support from local authorities. Nearly a
quarter of visits are made by people from
overseas, 59% of whom cited museums as an
important reason for coming to the UK. Some
40,000 staff are employed in UK museums.
The Government’s 24-Hour Museum project
will allow easier round-the-clock access on¬
line to information about UK collections.
Museums and galleries in the UK receive
about £400 million a year in public
expenditure. All national ones are financed
chiefly from government funds; they may
charge for entry to their permanent collections
and special exhibitions, although the
Government has set the scene for admission
charges to be phased out over the next few
years (see p. 250). All of the national
collections in England are managed by
independent trustees.
Museums and galleries maintained by local
authorities, universities and independent or
privately funded bodies may receive help in
building up their collections through grants
administered by the Museums & Galleries
Commission (MGC) and the Area Museum
Councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. Support to national and regional
public and independent museums and
galleries is also given by the Arts Councils and
by trusts and voluntary bodies, including the
Henry Moore Foundation, the Calouste
Gulbenkian Foundation and the National Art
Collections Fund.
The MGC promotes the interests of all UK
museums and galleries, and undertakes
strategic work to raise museum standards. It
also provides funds to the seven English Area
Museum Councils, which supply services,
advice, and their own small grants to
individual museums, and to the Museums
Training Institute and the Museum
Documentation Association. The Government
is considering the response to its proposals for
a new body combining functions of the MGC
and the Library and Information Commission
(LIC—see p. 268).
The MGC administers a system whereby
pre-eminent works of art may be accepted by
the Government in settlement of inheritance
tax and allocated to public galleries; items
accepted in 1997-98 include: a painting of the
Palace of the Dukes of Brabant in Brussels
(1672) by Jan van der Heyden (Ulster
Museum); paintings by Monet, Modigliani
and Bonnard (Fitzwilliam Museum,
Cambridge); and an early 16th-century
263
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Armagnac illuminated manuscript of the trials
of Joan of Arc (Victoria and Albert Museum—
V&A—in London).
The National Lottery (see chapter 9) has
led to unprecedented investment. For
instance, in July 1998 the Heritage Lottery
Fund (HLF) distributed £24 million to the
Museums & Galleries on Merseyside for
improvements to the Liverpool Museum, the
Walker Art Gallery and the Museum of
Liverpool Life; while the V&A received £15
million to renovate its British galleries.
Among notable displays in 1998 were an
exhibition (‘The Fragile Cell’) of paintings at
the Tate St Ives by John Wells, senior
surviving artist of the pre-war St Ives school,
who has been called Britain’s most important
abstract painter. The Tate Gallery in
Liverpool, recently expanded at a cost of £7
million, launched ‘Artranspennine 98’, the
UK’s largest ever modern art exhibition; while
the Tate in London presented new work by
Lucien Freud, as well as canvases by Patrick
Heron, a significant post-war abstract painter,
influenced by the light and surrounds of
Cornwall. Anish Kapoor, an acclaimed British
sculptor, helped to arrange his first major
showing in a UK public gallery at the
Hayward in London. The life and
relationships of Edward James, a legendary
British patron of 20th-century art, were
highlighted at the Brighton Museum and Art
Gallery. A Futures Gallery opened at the
Museum of Science and Industry in
Manchester; features include an Internet
access centre and a replica of the ‘Baby’
computer, the first computer as we know it. A
bird’s-eye view of London in 1806-10 (the
Rhinebeck Panorama), discovered in New
York State, was bought for the Museum of
London for £199,500.
The NatWest Art Prize winner in 1998
(open to candidates aged 35 or under, with a
top prize of £26,000 and 10 other awards of
£1,000 each) was the Scots painter Calum
Innes. The National Portrait Gallery’s BP
award, worth £10,000, went to Thomas
Watson (for ‘Jude’); he will also get a
commission worth £3,000 to paint a portrait
for the gallery. The Turner Prize (worth
£20,000), established by the Tate Gallery’s
Patrons of New Art and awarded annually to a
British artist under 50 for an outstanding
exhibition or other presentation of their work,
was won in 1997 by Gillian Wearing (for her
work over the previous 12 months—‘The
Cauldron’, ‘Full House’ and the video 10-16)
out of 1,500 entries.

CULTURE
The National Gallery has completed a £50
million renovation, without a penny of
taxpayer’s money, most of the funds
coming from private patrons. The restored
north galleries hold the finest French and
Dutch paintings in the collection. At the
V&A, the Canon Gallery, opened in May
1998, has a five-year display programme
for its 300,000 photoprints, started in the
1850s, one of the two or three great
photographic collections in the world,
including daguerrotypes and calotypes
from 1839, and work by such
photographers as Julia Margaret Cameron,
Cecil Beaton and David Bailey.
The Conservation Centre of the
National Museums & Galleries on
Merseyside won the European Museum of
the Year prize in 1998, beating off
competition from 57 museums in 23
countries. Judges were particularly
impressed by the emphasis on public
access.
The Government published a draft Code of
Good Access Practice, requiring museums and
galleries in receipt of public subsidy and all
those registered by the MGC to produce
access plans; the final version was to be
published at the end of 1998. To ensure that
those that do not charge for admission remain
free, £2 million has been made available to
them. In addition, the HLF has created a
Museums and Galleries Access Fund: £7
million will be available for UK museums and
galleries in the first year to support touring
exhibitions, transport to museums and other
audience development measures.
Of the additional £100 million to be
granted to museums and galleries (see p. 250)
£15 million is set aside for 43 non-national
museums in England whose collections have
been designated as pre-eminent.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries
contain some of the world’s most
comprehensive exhibits of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and
general interest. The English national
museums are:
• the British Museum (including the
ethnographic collections of the Museum
of Mankind);
• the Natural History Museum;
• the V&A (fine and decorative arts);
• the National Museum of Science &
Industry, including the Science Museum
and its two regional institutes—the
National Railway Museum (York) and
the National Museum of Photography,
Film and Television (Bradford);
• the National Gallery (western painting
from about 1260 to 1900);
• the Tate Gallery, with collections in
London (British painting and modern
art), Liverpool and St Ives (St Ives
School and modern art);
• the National Portrait Gallery;
• the Imperial War Museum, which has
three sites in London and one at Duxford
(which includes the American Air
Museum) in Cambridgeshire;
• the Royal Armouries, Britain’s oldest
museum, which has exhibits in the
Tower of London (relating to the
Tower’s history), Leeds (arms and
armoury) and Fort Nelson, near
Portsmouth (artillery);
• the National Army Museum;
• the Royal Air Force Museum;
• the National Maritime Museum;
• the Wallace Collection (paintings,
furniture, arms and armour, and objets
d’art); and
• the National Museums & Galleries on
Merseyside.
In Scotland the national collections are held
by the National Museums of Scotland and the
National Galleries of Scotland. The former
include the Royal Museum of Scotland, the
Scottish United Services Museum and the
Scottish Agricultural Museum, in Edinburgh;
the Museum of Flight, near North Berwick;
265
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and the Museum of Costume at Shambellie
House near Dumfries. The new National
Museum of Scotland, devoted to Scottish
history and opened in November 1998, is
described as one of the major post-war
buildings in the UK and has been designed to
fit into the fabric of Edinburgh’s old town.
The National Galleries of Scotland
comprise the National Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. The
National Galleries also have deposits at Paxton
House near Berwick and Duff House in Banff.
In 1997-98 the National Museums of
Scotland attracted some 1.2 million visitors,
and the National Galleries of Scotland nearly
1 million.
The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff
has a number of branches, including the
Museum of Welsh Life at St Fagans, the Slate
Museum at Llanberis and the Industrial and
Maritime Museum in the Cardiff Bay
development. Landscapes donated to the
Welsh people by Graham Sutherland, and
displayed two or so months a year at different
sites, were shown at Penarth in 1998.
Northern Ireland’s three major museums—
the Ulster Museum in Belfast; the Ulster Folk
and Transport Museum in County Down; and
the Ulster-American Folk Park in County
Tyrone—merged in 1998 to form the National
Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland.
Commemorating the 200th anniversary of the
rebellion of 1798, the Up in Arms exhibition
was the first to be launched under the new
arrangements.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London
include the Museum of London (social and
domestic life of the capital from earliest
times); Sir John Soane’s Museum (antiquities,
fine art and paintings by Hogarth); the
Courtauld Institute Galleries (masterpieces of
14th-20th-century European painting); and
the London Transport Museum.
Museums outside London include, for
example, the Bowes Museum at Barnard
Castle near Durham, strong in Spanish
painting, porcelain and 18th-century French
furniture, and other museums associated with
universities, such as the Ashmolean in Oxford,
the Fitzwilliam at Cambridge and the
Hunterian in Glasgow.
The public may visit many displays of art
and antiques, both in historic family houses,
such as Chatsworth (seat of the dukes of
Devonshire) and Houghton (seat of the
marquesses of Cholmondeley), and in houses
owned by the two National Trusts (see p. 328)
and English Heritage (see p. 326).
Among a number of national art exhibiting
societies is the famous Royal Academy of Arts,
at Burlington House in London, which holds
an annual Summer Exhibition and other
important ones during the year. The Summer
Exhibition is the world’s largest open present-
day art display and combines work by
established artists and by others showing for
the first time. The Royal Scottish Academy
holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There
are also children’s shows, including the
National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Open-air museums depict the life of an area
or preserve early industrial remains, such as
the Weald and Downland Museum in West
Sussex, the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in
Shropshire and the North of England Open
Air Museum at Beamish in County Durham.
Skills of the past are revived in a number of
‘living’ museums, such as the Gladstone
Pottery Museum near Stoke-on-Trent and the
Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in Cheshire.
Crafts
The crafts in the UK have an annual turnover
estimated at £400 million. Government aid for
the crafts, amounting to £3.2 million in
1997-98, has been administered in England
and Wales by the Crafts Council, which the
Government proposes to incorporate into a
new body with the ACE. Grants are available
to help with setting up workshops and
acquiring equipment. The Crafts Council runs
the National Centre for Crafts in London,
organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair, and
co-ordinates British groups at international
trade fairs. Crafts Council exhibitions tour
nationally and internationally. The Council
has an Education Unit, which runs lectures,
seminars and workshops for students, teachers
and the public. Craftworks, an independent
266
CULTURE
company, is the crafts development agency for
Northern Ireland. The Arts Council of
Northern Ireland and the SAC also fund crafts
promotion.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and
applied art departments of universities (these
include the Slade School of Art and
Goldsmith’s College of Art, London); and in
further education colleges and private art
schools. Many of these institutions award
degrees at postgraduate level. Art is also
taught at an advanced level at the four
Scottish Central (Art) Institutions.
University courses concentrate largely on
academic disciplines, such as the history of art.
The Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology at University
College London are leading institutions. The
Open University also offers courses in art
history and theory. Art is a foundation subject
in the National Curriculum. The Society for
Education through Art encourages, among
other activities, schools to buy original works
by organising an annual Pictures for Schools
exhibition.
Export Control of Works of Art
London is the art capital of the world, leading
a UK sales industry employing 50,000 with an
annual turnover of £2,200 million. Auctions of
works of art take place in the main auction
houses (two of the longest established being
Sotheby’s and Christie’s), and through private
dealers. In June 1998 Monet’s ‘Water Lily
Pond and Path by the Water’ sold for £19.8
million at Sotheby’s, a world record price for
this impressionist and the third highest price
ever paid in London for a painting.
Certain items are covered by export
control; guidance is provided by the Export
Licensing Unit of the DCMS. A licence is
required before such items can be exported,
and if the DCMS advisers object to the
granting of a licence, the matter is referred to
the Reviewing Committee on the Export of
Works of Art. If the Committee considers a
work to be of national importance, it can
advise the Government to defer a decision on
the licence application for a specified time to
provide an opportunity for an offer to be made
to buy at or above the recommended fair
market price.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
Outstanding literary merit is recognised by a
number of awards. The David Cohen British
Literature Prize for a lifetime’s achievement
by a living writer, awarded biennially and
worth £40,000, enables the winner to
nominate a young writer or literature
organisation for financial help. The public is
invited to nominate writers for consideration
by the panel of judges. Muriel Spark won the
award in 1997.
The English novelist Penelope Fitzgerald
won the American National Book Critics
Circle fiction award in 1998 for The Blue
Flower. Winner of the 1997 Booker Prize for
Fiction (worth £20,000; UK and
Commonwealth citizens eligible) was the
Indian writer Arundhati Roy, for The God of
Small Things, while the Whitbread awards
(valued at £2,000 each with £21,000 extra for
Book of the Year; for British subjects) were
distributed as follows:
• Book of the Year and Poetry Award: Ted
Hughes, Tales From Ovid',
• Novel award: Jim Grace, Quarantine',
• First Novel award: Pauline Melville,
The Ventriloquist’s Tale',
• Biography award: Graham Robb, Victor
Hugo', and
• Children’s Book of the Year (£10,000):

Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary works (including computer
programs and databases), and dramatic,
musical or artistic works, films, sound
recordings, cable programmes and broadcasts,
are automatically protected by copyright in
the UK. This protection is also given to works
from EU member states, or from countries
party to international copyright conventions
or reciprocal agreements. The copyright
owner has rights against unauthorised
reproduction, public performance,
broadcasting, rental and lending, and issue to
the public of his or her work; and against
dealing in unauthorised copies. In most cases
the author is the first owner of the copyright,
and the term of copyright in literary, dramatic,
musical and artistic works is the life of the
author and a period of 70 years from the end
of the year in which he or she dies. For films
the term is 70 years from the end of the
calendar year in which the death occurs of the
last to die of the following: principal director,
authors of the screenplay and dialogue, or
composer of music for the film. Sound
recordings are protected for 50 years from the
end of the year of making or release, and
broadcasts for 50 years from the end of the
year of broadcast.
Performers are also given automatic
protection against broadcasting and inclusion
in cable programme services, recording of live
performances, reproduction of recordings, and
issue to the public of copies of a recording or
rental or lending of such copies. This lasts for
50 years from the year of performance or
release of a recording of it. Performers also
have a right to equitable remuneration for the
playing in public, or inclusion in a broadcast
or cable programme service, of a commercially
published sound recording—linked to the
importance of the contribution which the
performer makes to that recording. A new
right against the extraction and re-utilisation
of the contents of a database (‘database rights’)
was introduced from 1 January 1998.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association and the Royal Society of
Literature. The leading society for studies in
the humanities is the British Academy for the
Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and
Philological Studies (the British Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several devoted to particular
authors, such as Jane Austen and Charles
Dickens. The Poetry Society sponsors poetry
readings and recitals. London’s South Bank
Centre runs a programme of literary events.
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service. There are over
5,000 public libraries in the UK, which
employ more than 27,000 people. In England
about 60% of adults are members of their local
library and about half of these borrow a least
once a month. The number of books borrowed
has remained high: 502 million books and 35
million audio-visual items from UK public
libraries in 1996—97.
Many libraries have collections of compact
discs, records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local history,
and all provide services for children, while
reference and information sections, and art,
music, commercial and technical departments,
meet a growing demand. The information role
is important for all libraries, and greater use is
being made of IT, including personal
computers, CD-ROMs and reference
databases. A prime government initiative under
the New Opportunities Fund (see p. 251) will
equip all UK public library staff with the skills
to help learners make the best use of IT. The
Fund will also provide money which will allow
much of the material held by libraries to be
stored and accessed in digitised form.
The Government is advised by the LIC
(see p. 263), a forum for policy on library and
268
CULTURE
information provision in general, and the
Advisory Council on Libraries, for public
libraries in England. In 1997 the LIC
recommended the establishment of a national
public library IT network, to enable access to
a wider range of services for a broader cross-
section of the population. The Government is
committed to developing IT facilities in all
public libraries by 2002.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information services. Founded in
1877, the Association has 26,000 members. It
maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians
and is the designated authority for the
recognition of qualifications gained in other
EU member states.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors royalties from a central
fund (totalling £4.9 million in 1998—99) for
the loans made of their books from public
libraries in the UK. Payment is made
according to the number of times an author’s
books are lent out. The maximum yearly
payment an author can receive is £6,000.
The British Library and National
Libraries
The British Library (BL), the national library
of the UK, is one of the world’s great libraries,
with a collection, dating from 1753, of more
than 150 million separate items. These include
books, journals, manuscripts, newspapers,
stamps, maps and recorded sound. British
publishers are legally obliged to deposit a copy
of their publications at the BL.
In 1996—97 the BL catalogued almost 1
million, and acquired 2.4 million, items,
maintained 353 miles of stock and preserved
235,000 volumes. It is also the guardian of
treasures such as Magna Carta and
Shakespeare’s First Folio. Some 475,000
reader visits are made to the BL each year.
The reading rooms are open to those who
need to see material not readily available
elsewhere or whose work or studies require
the facilities of the national library; access to
all reading rooms is free.
The BL’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within the UK
and between the UK and other countries. It
dispatches over 4 million documents a year.
The Research and Innovation Centre in
London is a major source of funding for
research and development in library and
information services.
The BL’s new building at St Pancras in
London, put up at a cost of £511 million and
officially opened in June 1998, gives it its first
purpose-built home, with environmentally
controlled storage, and improved facilities for
readers and public, including three exhibition
galleries and a conference centre. The
Humanities Reading Room, the largest,
opened in November 1997. All reading areas
will be open by mid-1999.
The National Libraries of Scotland and
Wales, the Bodleian at Oxford and the
Cambridge University Library (and the
Library of Trinity College, Dublin) can also
claim copies of all new British publications
under legal deposit.
University and other Non-public
Libraries
As well as public and national libraries there
are nearly 700 in higher and further education,
about 5,600 in schools and 2,220 specialised
libraries within other public and private sector
organisations (such as commercial companies,
research councils and government
departments).
The university book collections of Oxford
and Cambridge are unmatched by those of
more recent foundations. However, the
combined stores of the colleges and
institutions of the University of London total
9 million volumes, the John Rylands
University Library of Manchester contains 3.5
million volumes, Edinburgh 2.5 million,
Leeds 2.3 million, and Durham, Glasgow,
Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over 1
million volumes. Many universities have vital
research collections in special subjects—the
269
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham and
the British Library of Political and Economic
Science at the London School of Economics,
for example.
Besides a number of great private
collections, such as that of the London
Library (for private subscribers), there are the
collections of such learned societies as the
Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Geographical Society and the Royal
Academy of Music. The Poetry Library in the
South Bank Centre, owned by the Arts
Council of England, is a collection of 20th-
century poetry written in or translated into
English; it has about 60,000 volumes.
The Public Record Office (PRO) in London
and in Kew (Surrey) houses the records of the
superior courts of law of England and Wales
and of most government departments, as well
as famous historical documents. The PRO has
millions of documents, such as Domesday Book
(1086) and the coroner’s report on the death of
Christopher Marlowe (1593). Public records,
with a few exceptions, are available for
inspection by the public 30 years after the end
of the year in which they were created. The
Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh and the
PRO of Northern Ireland in Belfast serve the
same purpose.
Books
In 1997 British publishers issued just over
100,000 separate titles (including new editions).
The UK book industry exported books worth
£843 million in 1997,4.6% down on 1996.
Among the leading trade organisations are
the Publishers Association (PA), which has
200 members; and the Booksellers Association,
with just under 3,300 members. The PA,
through its International Division, promotes
the export of British books. The Welsh Book
Council supports the publication of books in
the Welsh language. The Book Trust
encourages reading and the promotion of
books through an information service and a
children’s library.
Electronic publishers Online Originals,
launched with 16 works in 1997, post
fiction, non-fiction and drama on an
Internet site—an alternative distribution
method for new authors whose work may
not be commercial. A reader logging on to
the site (www.onlineoriginals.com) can
sample a long section of any work before
buying, for delivery by e-mail.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts locates, reports on, and gives
information and advice about historical papers
outside the public records. It also advises
private owners, grant-awarding bodies, record
offices, local authorities and the Government
on the acquisition and maintenance of
manuscripts. The Commission maintains the
National Register of Archives (the central
collecting point for information about British
historical manuscripts) and the Manorial
Documents Register, which are available to
researchers.

Developments in broadcasting and communications technology continue to
accelerate, and the United Kingdom is at the forefront of the digital age, with
the launch of new terrestrial, satellite and cable services from late 1998.
Meanwhile, the maintenance of media standards remains an issue of public
concern, in part reflected in the strengthening of the Code of Practice of the
Press Complaints Commission.
Television and Radio
Broadcasting in the UK has traditionally been
based on the principle that it is a public
service accountable to the people. While
retaining this essential element, it now also
embraces the principles of competition and
choice. Three public bodies have the main
responsibility for television and radio services.
These authorities work to broad requirements
and objectives defined or endorsed by
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
their day-to-day conduct of business. They
are:
• the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation), which broadcasts television
and radio programmes;
• the ITC (Independent Television
Commission), which licenses and
regulates commercial television services
including cable, satellite and independent
teletext services, whether delivered by
digital or analogue technology; and
• the Radio Authority, which licenses and
regulates commercial radio services,
including cable and satellite.
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport is responsible for government policy
towards broadcasting.
There are at present five established
terrestrial analogue channels broadcasting across
the UK, offering a mixture of drama, light
entertainment, films, sport, educational,
children’s and religious programmes, news and
current affairs, and documentaries. These
comprise two national BBC networks, financed
almost wholly by a licence fee, and the
commercial ITV (Channel 3), Channel 4 and
Channel 5 services, which are funded by
advertising and sponsorship. In Wales, S4C—
Sianel Pedwar Cymru—^broadcasts programmes
on the fourth channel. Satellite television and

cable services are mainly funded by subscription
income. Digital television services will be
available from late 1998 (see p. 273).
People in the UK spend almost 16 hours a
week listening to the radio. The BBC has five
national radio networks, which together
transmit all types of music, news, current
affairs, drama, education, sport and a range of
features programmes. There are also 39 BBC
local radio stations serving England and the
Channel Islands, and national regional radio
services in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, including Welsh and Gaelic language
stations. BBC radio services currently attract
about 48% of listeners.
There are three national commercial radio
stations (see pp. 278-9). About 200 independent
local radio (ILR) services are also in operation.
Stations supply local news and information,
sport, music and other entertainment, education
and consumer advice.
An expansion of local and national radio will
be made possible with digital audio broadcasting
(see p. 273). BBC digital radio broadcasts began
in September 1995. The first commercial digital
radio services are due to be broadcast in 1999.
CHANGES IN REGULATION
Broadcasting in the UK is undergoing radical
change. The availability of more radio
frequencies, together with satellite, cable and
microwave transmissions, has already made a
greater number of local, national and
international services possible. The transition
from analogue to digital transmission
technology has the potential to expand this
capacity enormously. Digital broadcasting is a
new, more effective way of transmitting radio
and television services. It allows much more
information than before to be transmitted, and
can offer many more channels, extra services,
interactivity and higher quality picture and
sound to viewers and listeners willing to invest
in new receiving equipment.
Broadcasting Act 1996
In recognition of this potential, legislation was
passed in 1996 setting out a flexible regulatory
framework for the introduction of digital
terrestrial broadcasting and paving the way for
more broadly based competitive media groups.
There were four key objectives:
• to safeguard plurality of media ownership
and diversity of viewpoint;
• to preserve the UK’s tradition of public
service broadcasting;
• to support the competitiveness of the
British broadcasting industry and give the
UK the opportunity to lead the world in
the exploitation of digital technology; and
• to ensure broadcasters maintain
appropriate standards of impartiality,
taste and decency.
Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting
The 1996 Act has provided for:
• the licensing of at least 24 national digital
terrestrial television channels,
transmitted on six frequency channels or
‘multiplexes’,1 and serving, in the
1 Through the process known as multiplexing, the signals of
several broadcasters are combined into a single stream on a
single-frequency channel. There is therefore no longer a
direct one-to-one relationship between a television service
and a frequency. The signals are finally received and
decoded by digital receivers or set-top boxes attached to
existing television sets.
272
THE MEDIA
medium term, from 60% to over 90% of
the population; and
• the licensing of at least 12 digital radio
services on two national multiplexes,
with at least one multiplex available for
local services in most areas of the UK,
and an additional multiplex for extra
local services in areas of greatest demand.
The Act guaranteed capacity on three of the
six digital television multiplexes and on one
national radio multiplex for the existing public
service broadcasters. The legislation also
required that the ITC and Radio Authority
award national multiplex licences to those
applicants whose plans best promote the
development of digital broadcasting—by
installing the new transmission network as
quickly as possible, making consumer receiver
equipment as affordable as possible, and
broadening consumer choice of programming.2
Many of the new services on digital
television will be available on a subscription or
pay-per-view basis. Any broadcaster wishing to
offer pay-television needs to use a ‘conditional
access’ system (covering encryption,
scrambling and subscription management
services) to ensure that only those who have
paid for a particular service receive it. Since any
dominant provider of such systems would have
the power to determine who can, or cannot,
enter the pay-television market, it is important
that providers are subject to effective
regulation. The Government has implemented
European Union regulations to ensure that all
broadcasters can gain access on ‘fair, reasonable
and non-discriminatory terms’ to any digital
set-top boxes which can receive their signal.
OFTEL (see p. 377), in consultation with the
ITC, has powers to intervene over anti¬
competitive behaviour.
Media Ownership
Legislation in 1990 laid down rules enabling
the ITC and Radio Authority to keep
2 Licences to operate commercial digital television
multiplexes were awarded by the ITC in 1997, clearing the
way for digital terrestrial television to be up and running in
the course of 1998. The Radio Authority advertised
commercial radio multiplex licences in early 1998.
ownership of the broadcasting media widely
spread and to prevent undue concentrations of
single and cross-media ownership, in the
wider public interest. A government review of
ownership regulation issued in 1995
concluded that the existing rules needed to be
relaxed, both within and across different
media sectors; this would reflect the needs and
aspirations of the industry against the
background of accelerating technological
change. Following on from those
recommendations, the 1996 Act:
• allowed for greater cross-ownership
between newspaper groups, television
companies and radio stations, at both
national and regional levels; and
• introduced ‘public interest’ criteria by
which the regulatory authorities can
assess and approve (or disallow) mergers
or acquisitions between newspapers and
television and radio companies.
The legislation overturned the rule that no
one company could own more than two of the
ITV (Channel 3) licences; instead, a new limit
was set whereby no company could control
franchises covering more than 15% of the total
television audience. Local newspapers with
more than a 50% share of their market may
own a local radio station, providing at least
one other independent local radio station is
operating in that area.
Recent Developments
In February 1998 the Government published a
consultation paper (Television: the Digital
Future) alongside an independent research
report (A Study to Estimate the Economic
Impact of Government Policies Towards Digital
Television). The report suggested that take-up
of digital television services would depend
largely on the time taken by viewers to replace
their principal television sets, but that the
assessment of a firm date for switching off the
analogue broadcast transmissions would help
in accelerating the take-up of digital services.
The Government is also undertaking a
review of the future regulation of broadcasting
and telecommunications, taking account of the
implications of the increasing technological
convergence between the two sectors.
273
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
A Green Paper on these issues (Regulating
Communications: Approaching Convergence in the
Information Age) was published in July 1998.
THE BBC
A Royal Charter and Agreement govern the
constitution, finances and obligations of the
BBC. The Corporation’s Board of Governors,
including the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and a
National Governor each for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland, is appointed by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. The
Board of Governors is ultimately responsible
for all aspects of broadcasting by the BBC.
The Governors appoint the Director-General,
the Corporation’s chief executive officer, who
heads the Executive Committee and Board of
Management—the bodies in charge of the
daily running of the Corporation.
The BBC has a regional structure
throughout the UK. The three English
regions—BBC North, BBC Midlands & East
and BBC South—and BBC Scotland, BBC
Wales and BBC Northern Ireland make
programmes for their local audiences as well as
contributing to the national network.
The National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland advise
on the content of television and radio
programmes intended mainly for reception in
their areas. Ten Regional Councils in England
advise the Board of Governors on the needs
and concerns of their audiences.
BBC Charter and Agreement
In 1996 a new Royal Charter came into effect,
enabling the BBC to continue as the UK’s
main public service broadcaster until 2006.
The Agreement between the BBC and the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, which runs concurrently with the
Charter, formally establishes the
Corporation’s editorial independence in all
matters of programme content, scheduling
and management. It also provides for the
licence fee to remain the chief source of
finance for the BBC’s public service activities
until at least 2002.
The new Charter and Agreement maintain
the BBC’s essential characteristics as a public
corporation; preserve its primary objectives of
providing broadcasting services of
information, education and entertainment;
and reinforce the duties placed on the
Governors to maintain programme standards
and to ensure the Corporation’s accountability
to its audiences. They also allow for the
development of the BBC’s commercial
activities, in partnership with the private
sector, in the UK and abroad (although these
must be funded, operated and accounted for
separately from its licence-fee-funded
services).
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed predominantly by a licence fee. All
households or premises with a television set
must buy an annual licence (costing £97.50 for
colour and £32.50 for black and white in
1998-99).
Licence income (which totalled £2,009
million in 1997-98) is supplemented by profits
from BBC Worldwide commercial activities
(see p. 276), such as television programme
exports, sales of recordings, publications and
other merchandise connected with BBC
programmes, hire and sale of educational
films, film library sales, and exhibitions based
on programmes. The BBC World Service’s
radio broadcasting operations are financed by
a grant-in-aid from the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office, while BBC Worldwide
Television is self-financing.
The BBC’s transmission network was
privatised in early 1997, providing new funds
for investment in digital services.
Organisation
The structure of the BBC comprises:
• BBC Broadcast, which schedules
channels and commissions services for
audiences in the UK and abroad;
• BBC Production, which develops the
BBC’s in-house radio and television
production capability across all genres
and media;
• BBC News, which is responsible for an
integrated national and international
274
THE MEDIA
news operation across the full range of
BBC news and current affairs services;
• BBC Worldwide (see p. 276), which is
responsible for generating income in the
UK and abroad, and for the World
Service;
• the Corporate Centre, which provides
strategic services to the BBC as a whole;
and
• BBC Resources, which provides support
facilities and expertise to BBC
programme-makers and broadcasters
(and which was established as a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Corporation in
August 1998).
BBC Television
The BBC, which launched the world’s first
regular television service in 1936, broadcasts
over 20,000 hours of television each year on its
two domestic channels to national and regional
audiences:
• BBC 1 is the channel of broad appeal. In
1997-98 it broadcast over 1,250 hours of
features, documentaries and current
affairs programmes, over 1,000 hours of
drama and light entertainment, 500 hours
of sport and 450 hours of children’s
programmes.
• BBC 2 is the channel of innovation and
flexibility. It caters for special audience
interests, with a variety of programmes
including documentaries, late-night
comedy and leisure and lifestyle shows.
Programmes are made at, or acquired
through, Television Centre in London and six
major bases throughout the UK (Glasgow in
Scotland, Cardiff in Wales, Belfast in
Northern Ireland, and Birmingham, Bristol
and Manchester in England); or they are
commissioned from independent producers—
the BBC must ensure that at least 25% of its
original programming comes from the
independent sector.
In October 1997 the Government gave
approval for the launch of the BBC’s 24-hour
news channel (News 24) on cable services and
during the night on BBC 1. The channel,
funded by the licence fee, began broadcasting
in November 1997 and is available to viewers
without additional charge. News 24 is a key
element in the BBC’s plans for digital
broadcasting and the Corporation intends to
make it available on all digital platforms as
soon as possible. In December 1997 the BBC
launched its Online information service on the
Internet (see also p. 289), also funded by the
licence fee and free to users.
The Corporation’s plans to provide a range
of new, digital services to all licence fee
payers include:
• an extended BBC 1 and BBC 2 in
widescreen;
• News 24 (see above);
• BBC Choice (a supplementary service
to complement and enhance the
network schedules, which began in
September 1998); and
• BBC Learning (an educational
channel offering programming for
children, parents, teachers and adult
learners).
In its first commercial broadcasting venture
in the UK, the BBC began themed
subscription services in November 1997, in
partnership with Flextech Pic, under the
brand name UKTV. These services are not
funded by the licence fee.
Education is a central component of the
BBC’s public service commitment on its
domestic channels. A wide range of
educational programmes is broadcast for
primary and secondary schools (over 90% of
which use BBC schools television), further
education colleges and the Open University
(see p. 140), while programmes for adults
cover numeracy, literacy, language learning,
health, work and vocational training. Books,
pamphlets, computer software, and audio and
video cassettes are produced to supplement
the programmes. The Learning Zone provides a
night-time education and training service, and
specialist programming for further education
colleges is provided through FETV (Further
Education TV). BBC Learning (the UK’s first
275
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
public service learning channel—p. 275) is
planned for launch in late 1998.
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio, broadcasting to the
whole of the UK, serves an audience of 29
million each week, transmitting over 42,000
hours of programmes each year on its five
networks (all broadcasting 24 hours a day):
• BBC Radio 1 (broadcasting on 97.6-99.8
FM) is a leading contemporary music
station, serving a target audience of 15-
to 24-year-olds. It plays top-selling, new
and specialist music, covers live
performances, social action campaigns
and broadcasts music documentaries and
news programmes.
• BBC Radio 2 (88-91 FM) provides
popular music (including folk, country,
gospel, rhythm & blues, brass band, and
light classics), comedy, arts and speech.
• BBC Radio 3 (90.2-92.4 FM) offers a
wide repertoire of classical music and jazz,
more than half of which is performed live
or is specially recorded, together with
drama, documentaries and discussion.
• BBC Radio 4 (broadcast with some

BBC Worldwide
In 1994 the international and commercial
interests of the BBC were brought together in
BBC Worldwide, to enable the Corporation to
develop its role in the fast-expanding
broadcast and media world. BBC Worldwide
incorporates BBC World Service Radio,
funded by a government grant.
With responsibility for the BBC’s
commercial television activity, BBC
Worldwide is a major international
broadcaster and a leading distributor and co¬
producer of BBC programmes. In 1997-98 it
licensed more than 31,000 hours of
programming to over 300 broadcasters in 70
countries, making the BBC the largest
European exporter of television programmes.
BBC Worldwide works closely with BBC
production departments, independent
producers and its network of international
offices to determine commercial strategies for
key programmes with international licensing
potential. It is also developing premium
channels to compete in the international
marketplace. Its core service is BBC World, an
advertiser-funded, 24-hour international news
and information channel. The channel
provides news bulletins, in-depth analysis and
reports, and is available to over 52 million
homes around the world. BBC Prime, an
entertainment and drama channel for Europe,
has nearly 6 million subscribers.
In March 1998 BBC Worldwide signed an
agreement with a US media company,
Discovery Communications Inc., to create a
BBC-branded network in the United States
and to jointly develop quality channels for
pay-television around the world. The
agreement is expected to increase investment
in BBC factual programme-making for the
benefit of British licence fee payers, and
strengthen the international standing of the
Corporation.
BBC Worldwide also operates a large-scale
publishing and licensing operation covering
magazines, books, videos, audio sales, CD-
ROMS and a commercial on-line service.
World Service
BBC World Service broadcasts by radio in
English and 43 other languages worldwide. It
has an estimated global weekly audience of
around 138 million listeners. This excludes
any estimate for listeners in countries where it
is difficult to survey audiences. The core
programming of news, current affairs,
business and sports reports is complemented
by a wide range of cultural programmes,
including drama, literature and music.
276
THE MEDIA
BBC World Service programmes in English
and many other languages are made available
by satellite for rebroadcasting by agreement
with local or national radio stations, networks
and cable operators. BBC World Service Radio
International sells recorded programmes to
other broadcasters in over 100 countries.
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of BBC World Service,
provides transcripts of radio and television
broadcasts from over 140 countries. As well as
providing a vital source of information to the
BBC, this service is used by other media
organisations, government departments, the
commercial sector and academic institutions.
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING
Independent Television Commission
The ITC is responsible for licensing and
regulating commercial television services
(including BBC commercial services)
operating in, or from, the United Kingdom. It
does not make, broadcast or transmit
programmes itself.
The ITC must ensure that a wide range of
commercial television services is available
throughout the UK and that they are of a high
quality and appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. It must also ensure fair and effective
competition in the provision of these services,
and adherence to the rules on media
ownership.
The ITC regulates the various television
services through licence conditions, codes and
guidelines. The codes cover programme
content, advertising, sponsorship and
technical standards. If a licensee does not
comply with the conditions of its licence or
the codes, the ITC can impose penalties.
These range from a formal warning or a
requirement to broadcast an apology or
correction, to a fine. In extreme
circumstances, a company’s licence may be
shortened or revoked.
ITC staff regularly monitor programmes,
and take into account comments from viewers
and audience research. They are also advised
by 11 Viewer Consultative Councils (eight in
England, and one each in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland), and by specialist
committees on educational and religious
broadcasting and advertising.
ITV (Channel 3)
The first regular ITV programmes began in
London in 1955. ITV is made up of 15
regionally based television companies which
are licensed to supply programmes in the 14
independent television geographical regions.
There are two licences for London, one for
weekdays and the other for the weekend. An
additional ITC licensee provides a national
breakfast-time service, transmitted on the ITV
network.
The ITV licences for Channel 3 are
awarded for a 10-year period by competitive
tender to the highest bidder (who has to have
passed a quality threshold). Licensees must
provide a diverse programme service designed
to appeal to a wide range of viewers’ tastes and
interests. They have a statutory duty to
present programmes made in, and about, their
region, and there is also a requirement for
district and regional programming to be aimed
at different areas within regions.
Each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These
are produced by the company itself, by other
programme companies, or are bought from
elsewhere. As with the BBC, at least 25% of
original programming must come from the
independent sector. About one-third of the
output is made up of informative
programmes—news, documentaries, and
coverage of current affairs, education and
religion—while the remainder covers drama,
entertainment, sport, arts and children’s
programmes. Programmes are broadcast 24
hours a day throughout the country. A
common national and international news
service is provided by Independent Television
News (ITN).
Channel 3 companies are obliged to operate
a national programme network. The ITV
Network Centre, which is owned by the
companies, independently commissions and
schedules programmes.
Operating on a commercial basis, licensees
derive most of their income from selling
advertising time. Their financial resources and
programme production vary considerably,
277
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
depending largely on the population of the
areas in which they operate. Newspaper groups
can acquire a controlling interest in Channel 3
companies, although safeguards exist to ensure
against any undue concentrations of media
ownership (see p. 273).
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4 provides a national 24-hour television
service throughout the UK, except in Wales,
which has a corresponding service—S4C
(Sianel Pedwar Cymru). Channel 4 is a
statutory corporation, licensed and regulated by
the ITC, and funded by selling its own
advertising time.
Channel 4’s remit is to provide programmes
with a distinctive character and to appeal to
tastes and interests not generally catered for by
Channel 3. It must present a suitable proportion
of educational programmes and encourage
innovation and experiment. Channel 4
commissions programmes from the ITV
companies and independent producers and buys
programmes from overseas.
The fourth channel in Wales is allocated to
S4C, which is regulated by the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority. Members of the Welsh
Authority are appointed by the Government.
S4C must ensure that a significant proportion of
programming—and the majority between 18.30
and 22.00 hours—is in the Welsh language. At
other times it transmits national Channel 4
programmes. It is planning to broadcast a new
digital service incorporating current analogue
Welsh programmes and additional material.
Roughly 15% of S4Cs income comes from
advertising, programme sales, publicity and
merchandising; the remainder comes from a
government grant, the level of which is fixed by
statute.
Channel 5
The UK’s newest national terrestrial channel
went on air in March 1997, its 10-year licence
having been awarded by competitive tender to
Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited. Channel 5
serves about 70% of the population and is
supported by advertising revenue.
Like Channel 3, the new service is subject
to positive programming requirements. It
must show programmes of quality and
diversity, with a wide range of original
productions and commissions from
independent producers.
Gaelic Broadcasting
The Gaelic Broadcasting Committee is an
independent body committed to ensuring that
a wide range of quality television and radio
programmes is broadcast in Gaelic for
reception in Scotland. Its members are
appointed by the ITC, in consultation with
the Radio Authority. The Committee
distributes government money to programme
makers through the Gaelic Broadcasting
Fund.
The Radio Authority
The Radio Authority’s licensing and
regulatory remit covers all independent radio
services, including national, local, cable and
satellite services. Its three main tasks are to
plan frequencies, appoint licensees with a view
to broadening listener choice, and regulate
programming and advertising.
Like the ITC, the Radio Authority has to
make sure that licensed services are of a high
quality, and offer programmes which will
appeal to many different tastes and interests.
It has published codes covering engineering,
programmes, news and current affairs, and
advertising and sponsorship, to which
licensees must adhere.
Independent National Radio (INR)
There are three independent national radio
services, whose licences were awarded by the
Radio Authority through competitive tender,
and which broadcast 24 hours a day:
• Classic FM (100—102 FM), which
broadcasts mainly classical music,
together with news and information;
• Virgin 1215 (105.8 FM and 1215 MW),
which plays broad-based rock music (and
is supplemented by a separate Virgin
station which operates under a local
London licence); and
278
THE MEDIA
• Talk Radio UK (1053 and 1089 MW),
which is a speech-based service.
Independent Local Radio (ILR)
Independent local radio stations have been
broadcasting in the UK since 1973. ILR
stations broadcast a wide variety of
programmes and news of local interest, as well
as music and entertainment, traffic reports
and advertising. There are also stations
serving ethnic minority communities. The
Radio Authority awards independent local
licences, although not by competitive tender;
the success of licence applications is in part
determined by the extent to which applicants
widen choice and meet the needs and interests
of the people living in the area and in part by
whether they have the necessary financial
resources to sustain programme plans for the
eight-year licence period.
The Authority also issues restricted service
licences (RSLs)—short-term RSLs, generally
for periods of up to 28 days, for special events
or trial services, and long-term RSLs,
primarily for student and hospital stations, to
broadcast to specific establishments.
TELETEXT, CABLE AND SATELLITE
SERVICES
Teletext Services
Teletext is written copy broadcast on television
sets. There are several teletext services; one is
operated by the BBC and others by
independent television. They offer constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including news, sport, travel, weather
conditions and entertainment. The teletext
system allows the television signal to carry
additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics on
receivers equipped with the necessary
decoders. About 10.5 million homes have
teletext decoders and the weekly audience
approaches 16 million people. The BBC and
Channels 3,4 and 5 increasingly provide
subtitling for people with hearing difficulties.
The ITC awards teletext licences for
Channels 3, 4, and 5 by competitive tender for
a period of ten years. Applicants have to
satisfy certain statutory requirements before
their cash bid can be considered.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for
by subscription. The franchising of cable
systems and the regulation of cable television
services are carried out by the ITC, while the
Radio Authority issues cable radio licences.
‘Broadband cable’ systems can carry
between 30 and 65 television channels using
analogue technology (including terrestrial
broadcasts, satellite television and channels
delivered to cable operators by landline or
videotape), as well as a full range of
telecommunications services. Digital
technology is being introduced which will
support up to 500 television channels. Cable
also has the capacity for computer-based
interactive services such as video-on-demand,
home shopping, home banking, security and
alarm services, electronic mail and high-speed
Internet access. It can additionally supply
television services tailored specifically for local
communities; cable operators are testing
programming concepts to find out what works
best at the local level.
Cable franchises have been granted covering
areas which include 80% of all homes and
nearly all urban areas in the UK. Regulation is
as light as possible to encourage the
development of a wide range of services, and
flexible enough to adapt to new technology. In
April 1998 there were just over 11 million
homes able to receive broadband cable services
and nearly 2.5 million subscribing homes
(representing a TV penetration of 22.4%).
ITC licences are required for systems
capable of serving more than 1,000 homes.
Systems extending beyond a single building
and up to 1,000 homes require only an
individual licence regulated by OFTEL. Cable
investment must be privately financed.
There are no specific quality controls on
cable services. However, if cable operators also
provide their own programme content as
opposed to just conveying services, they
require a programme services licence from the
ITC, which includes consumer protection
requirements.
279
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Direct Broadcasting by Satellite
Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), by which
television is transmitted directly by satellite into
people’s homes, has been available throughout
the UK since 1989. The signals from satellite
broadcasting are received through specially
designed aerials or ‘dishes’. Most services are
paid for by subscription. Some offer general
entertainment, while others concentrate on
specific areas of interest, such as sport, music,
children’s programmes, and feature films.
All satellite television services provided by
broadcasters established in the UK are
licensed and regulated by the ITC. Around
180 satellite television service licences were in
force in mid-1998. Many of these are foreign
language services, some of them designed for
ethnic minorities within the UK and others
aimed primarily at audiences in other
countries. Viewers in the UK may also receive
a variety of television services from other
European countries. The largest satellite
programmer is BSkyB (British Sky
Broadcasting) which, with over 6 million
subscribers, dominates subscription-based
television in the UK.

280
THE MEDIA
Satellite services must comply with the
ITC’s programmes, advertising and
sponsorship codes, but they are not subject to
any positive programming obligations.
Satellite radio services must be licensed by
the Radio Authority if they are transmitted
from the UK for general reception within the
country, or if they are transmitted from
outside the UK but are managed editorially
from within it.
OTHER ASPECTS
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC may not obtain revenue from
broadcasting advertisements or from
commercial sponsorship of programmes on its
public service channels. Its policy is to avoid
giving publicity to any firm or organised
interest except when this is necessary in
providing effective and informative
programmes. It does, however, cover sponsored
sporting and artistic events. Advertising and
sponsorship are allowed on commercial
television and radio services, subject to
controls. The ITC and the Radio Authority
operate codes governing advertising standards
and programme sponsorship, and can impose
penalties on broadcasters failing to comply with
them.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast in breaks during
programmes as well as between programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed to influence
programme content. Advertisements must be
distinct and separate from programmes.
Advertising on terrestrial television is limited to
an average of seven minutes an hour during the
day and seven-and-a-half minutes in the peak
evening viewing period. Advertising is
prohibited in broadcasts of religious services
and in broadcasts to schools. Political
advertising and advertisements for betting
(other than the National Lottery, the football
pools and bingo) are prohibited. All tobacco
advertising is banned on television and cigarette
advertisements are banned on radio. Religious
advertisements may be broadcast on
commercial radio and television, provided they
comply with the guidelines issued by the ITC
and the Radio Authority.
Sponsorship in Independent Broadcasting
In the UK sponsorship is a relatively new way
of helping to finance commercial broadcasting,
although the practice has long been established
in other countries. In return for their financial
contribution, sponsors receive a credit
associating them with a particular programme.
The ITC’s Code of Programme Sponsorship
and the Radio Authority’s Advertising and
Sponsorship Code aim to ensure that sponsors
do not exert influence on the editorial content
of programmes and that sponsorships are made
clear to viewers and listeners. News and current
affairs programmes may not be sponsored.
Potential sponsors for other categories of
programme may be debarred if their
involvement could constrain the editorial
independence of the programme maker in any
way. References to sponsors or their products
must be confined to the beginning and end of a
programme and around commercial breaks;
they must not appear in the programme itself.
All commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins may be sponsored.
From 1 September 1998 the ITC permitted
masthead programming (programmes with the
same title as a magazine and made or funded by
its publishers) on all UK commercial television
services (Channels 3, 4, and 5 having previously
been excluded).
Government Publicity
Government publicity material to support non¬
political campaigns may be broadcast on
independent television and radio. This is paid
for on a normal commercial basis. Short public
service items, concerning health, safety and
welfare, are transmitted free by the BBC and
independent television and radio. All
government advertisements and public service
information films are subtitled via electronic
text to help people with hearing difficulties.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the broadcasting
authorities carries with it certain obligations
over programme content. Broadcasters must
display, as far as possible, a proper balance and
wide range of subject matter, impartiality in
281
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
matters of controversy and accuracy in news
coverage, and must not offend against good
taste. Broadcasters must also comply with
legislation relating to obscenity and incitement
to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio Authority
apply codes providing rules on impartiality, the
portrayal of violence and standards of taste and
decency in programmes, particularly during
hours when children are likely to be viewing or
listening. Television programmes broadcast
before 21.00 hours (or 20.00 hours on certain
cable and satellite services) are required to be
suitable for a general audience, including
children.
Broadcasting Standards Commission
The Broadcasting Standards Commission
(BSC) is required to:
• draw up and review guidance for the
avoidance of unjust or unfair treatment
and unwarranted infringement of privacy
in television and radio;
• draw up and review a code on the
portrayal of violence and sexual conduct
and on standards of taste and decency;
• monitor and report on the portrayal of
violence, sexual conduct and standards of
taste and decency in programmes
generally;
• consider and adjudicate on complaints
about fairness and standards;
• represent the Government at
international bodies concerned with
setting standards for broadcasting; and
• make arrangements for undertaking
research into matters related to, or
connected with, fairness and taste and
decency in broadcasting.
Parliamentary and Political
Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament
may be broadcast on television and radio,
either live or, more usually, in recorded and
edited form on news and current affairs
programmes. The BBC has a specific
obligation to transmit an impartial account day
by day of the proceedings in both Houses of
Parliament. In July 1998 the Corporation
announced plans to launch a new seven-day-a-
week parliamentary television service (initially
on analogue cable), additional to, and
independent of, its existing coverage of
Parliament.
The BBC and some of the commercial
services provide time on national radio and
television for an annual series of party political
broadcasts. Party election broadcasts are
arranged following the announcement of a
General Election. In addition, the
Government may make ministerial broadcasts
on radio and television, with opposition
parties also being allotted broadcast time.
In January 1998 the BBC, ITC, Radio
Authority and S4C jointly proposed several
changes to current party political broadcasting
practices. These included replacing the annual
series of broadcasts with more party election
broadcasts to reflect the growth in the number
of elected bodies in the UK, and introducing
election broadcasts for parties standing in
Northern Ireland and for the Scottish
Parliament and Welsh Assembly. The
responses of the political parties to the
proposals are being studied by the
broadcasting authorities.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the commercial sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising that they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board),
owned by an industry consortium
representing broadcasters and advertising
agencies. Joint research is undertaken for BBC
radio and for commercial radio by RAJAR
(Radio Joint Audience Research).
Both the BBC and the commercial sector
conduct regular surveys of audience opinion
on television and radio services. Public
opinion is further assessed by the BBC and
282
THE MEDIA
ITC through the work of their advisory
committees, councils and panels.
INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION
European Agreements
The UK has implemented two important
European agreements on cross-border
broadcasting—the European Community
Broadcasting Directive (which was revised in
1997) and the Council of Europe Convention
on Transfrontier Television. These aim to
ensure the free flow of television programmes
and services throughout participating
countries, setting minimum standards on
advertising, sponsorship, taste and decency
and the portrayal of sex and violence. If a
broadcast meets these standards then no
participating country may prevent reception
in its territory. The Directive also provides
Community-wide protection for national
measures securing public access to major
events on free terrestrial television.
Audiovisual Eureka (AYE), which has a
membership of 33 European countries
including the UK, aims to help improve
aspects of the European audiovisual industry
through practical measures to enhance
training, development and distribution. It
concentrates its work on the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe.
The UK participates in the European
Community MEDIA programme, which is
aimed at enhancing the strength of member
states’ national audiovisual industries by
encouraging greater collaboration between
them, and wider distribution of their
products.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC and the Radio Authority are
members of the European Broadcasting
Union, which manages Eurovision, the
international network of television news and
programme exchange. The Union is
responsible for co-ordinating the exchange of
programmes and news over the Eurovision
network and intercontinental satellite links. It
provides a forum linking the major public
services and national broadcasters of Western
Europe and other parts of the world, and co¬
ordinates joint operations in radio and
television.
The Press
More daily newspapers, national and regional,
are sold for every person in the United
Kingdom than in most other developed
countries. On an average weekday it is
estimated that well over half of people aged 15
and over read a national morning newspaper;
nearly 65% read a Sunday newspaper. Almost
90% of people read a regional or local
newspaper. National papers have an average
total circulation of 13 million on weekdays and
about 14.5 million on Sundays, although the
total readership is considerably greater. Men
are more likely to read newspapers than
women, and more people in the 25—44 age
group read a daily newspaper than in any
other age group.
There are about 1,350 regional and local
newspaper titles and about 7,000 periodical
publications.
Several newspapers have had very long and
distinguished histories. The Observer, for
example, first published in 1791, is the oldest
national Sunday newspaper in the world, and
The Times, Britain’s oldest daily national
newspaper, began publication in 1785.
The press caters for a range of political
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where they
express pronounced views and show obvious
political leanings in their editorial comments,
these may derive from proprietorial and other
non-party influences. Nevertheless, during
General Election campaigns many newspapers
recommend their readers to vote for a
particular political party. Even newspapers
which adopt strong political views in their
editorial columns sometimes include feature
and other types of articles by authors of
different political persuasions.
In order to preserve their character and
traditions, some newspapers and periodicals
are governed by trustee-type arrangements.
Others have management arrangements that
try to ensure their editors’ authority and
independence.
283
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Newsprint, more than half of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales revenue,
newspapers and periodicals earn considerable
amounts from their advertising. Indeed, the
press (newspapers, magazines and directories)
is by far the largest advertising medium in the
UK. Unlike most of its European counterparts
the British press receives no subsidies and
relatively few tax and postal concessions.
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TITLES
Ownership of the national, London and many
regional daily newspapers lies in the hands of a
number of large corporations, most of which
are involved in the whole field of publishing
and communications.
The National Press
The national press consists of ten morning
daily papers and nine Sunday papers (see
Table 17.1). At one time London’s Fleet
Street was the centre of the newspaper
industry, but now all the national papers have
moved their editorial and printing facilities to
other parts of London or away from the
capital altogether. Editions of several papers,
for example the Financial Times and The
Guardian, are also printed in other countries.
National newspapers are often described as
‘quality’, ‘mid-market’ or ‘popular’ papers on
the basis of differences in style and content.
Five dailies and four Sundays are usually
described as ‘quality’ newspapers, which are
directed at readers who want full information
on a wide range of public matters. Popular
newspapers appeal to people wanting news of
a more entertaining character, presented more
concisely. ‘Mid-market’ publications cover the
intermediate market. Quality papers are
normally broadsheet (large-sheet) in format
and mid-market and popular papers tabloid
(small-sheet).
Many newspapers are printed in colour and
most produce supplements as part of the
Saturday or Sunday paper, with articles on
travel, food and wine, and other leisure topics.
As Table 17.1 indicates, increasing
competition from other media in the delivery
of news, information and entertainment has
had its effect on the national press over the last
50 years, with a gradual decline in circulation
discernible for many titles.
Regional Newspapers
Most towns and cities throughout the UK
have their own regional or local newspaper.
These range from morning and evening dailies
to Sunday papers and others which are
published just once a week. They mainly
include stories of regional or local attraction,
but the dailies also cover national and
international news, often looked at from a local
viewpoint. They provide a valuable medium
for local advertising.
London, the capital, has one paid-for
evening paper, the Evening Standard. There
are local weekly papers for every district in
Greater London; these are often different local
editions of one centrally published paper.
The Daily Record has the highest circulation
of the Scottish regional papers. The weekly
press in Wales includes Welsh-language and
bilingual papers. Welsh community
newspapers receive an annual grant as part of
the Government’s wider financial support for
the Welsh language. Newspapers from the Irish
Republic, as well as the British national press,
are widely read in Northern Ireland.
Several hundred free distribution
newspapers, mostly weekly and financed by
advertising, are published in the UK. They
have enjoyed rapid growth in recent years.
Table 17.2 lists the average net circulations
of the leading regional daily, Sunday and paid-
for weekly newspapers across the UK.
Ethnic Minority Publications
Many newspapers and magazines in the UK
are produced by members of ethnic
minorities. Most are published weekly,
fortnightly or monthly. A Chinese newspaper,
Sing Tao, the Urdu Daily jfang and the Arabic
Al-Arab, however, are dailies.
Afro-Caribbean newspapers include
The Gleaner, The Voice and Caribbean Times,
which are all weeklies. The Asian Times is an
English language weekly for people of Asian
descent. Ethnic language publications appear

in Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and Punjabi. The
fortnightly Asian Trader and Asian Business are
both successful ethnic business publications,
while Cineblitz International targets those
interested in the Asian film industry.
Many provincial papers print special
editions for their local ethnic minority
populations.
THE PERIODICAL PRESS
There are about 7,000 separate periodical
publications which carry advertising. They are
generally defined as either ‘consumer’ titles,
providing readers with leisure-time
information and entertainment, or ‘business
and professional’ titles, which provide people
with material of relevance to their working
lives. Within the former category, there are
general consumer titles, which have a wide
appeal, and consumer specialist titles, aimed
specifically at groups of people with particular
interests, such as motoring or classical music.
A range of literary and political journals,
appearing monthly or quarterly, caters for a
more academic readership. There are also
many in-house and customer magazines
produced by businesses or public services for
their employees and/or clients.
The weekly periodicals with the highest
sales are those which carry full details of the
forthcoming week’s television and radio
programmes, including satellite schedules.
Sky TV Guide circulates over 3 million copies,
while What’s on TV and Radio Times have
sales in excess of 1 million. Reader’s Digest,
which covers a wide range of topics, has the
highest circulation (1.5 million) among
monthly magazines.
Women’s magazines traditionally enjoy
large readerships, while men’s general interest
titles have recently experienced a surge in
their circulations (see Table 17.3).
Children are well served with an array of
comics and papers, while magazines like
Smash Hits, Top of the Pops and Bliss, with
their coverage of the pop scene and features of
interest to young people, are very popular
with teenagers.
Leading journals of opinion include the
Economist, an independent commentator on

THE MEDIA
Weekly listings’ magazines like Time Out
provide details of cultural and other events in
London and other large cities.
There are more than 4,500 business and
professional titles, with the highest
concentrations in medicine, business
management, sciences, architecture and
building, social sciences, and computers.
Controlled (free) circulation titles represent
about two-thirds of the business and
professional magazine market. Around 95% of
business and professional people regularly
read the publications relevant to their sector.
PRESS INSTITUTIONS
Trade associations include the Newspaper
Publishers Association, whose members
publish national newspapers, and the
Newspaper Society, which represents British
regional and local newspapers. The Scottish
Daily Newspaper Society represents the
interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in
Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Publishers
Association acts on behalf of the owners of
weekly newspapers in Scotland; and
Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers is
made up of proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland. The membership of the
Periodical Publishers Association includes
most independent publishers of business,
professional and consumer journals.
The Guild of Editors is the officially
recognised professional body for newspaper
editors and their equivalents in radio and
television. It has approximately 500 members
and exists to defend press freedom and to
promote high editorial standards. The British
Association of Industrial Editors is the
professional organisation for editors of house
journals. The Association of British Editors
represents the whole range of media, including
radio, television, newspapers and magazines.
Organisations representing journalists are
the National Union of Journalists and the
Chartered Institute of Journalists. The main
printing union is the Graphical, Paper and

Media Union, with a membership of around
200,000.
The Foreign Press Association was formed
in 1888 to help the correspondents of overseas
newspapers in their work by arranging press
conferences, tours, briefings, and other
services and facilities.
News Agencies
The top international news agencies operating
in the UK are Reuters, Associated Press and
United Press International. The main agency
which gathers news inside the UK is the Press
Association (PA), which is owned by the
regional newspaper publishers and which
provides comprehensive coverage to the
national and regional print, broadcast and
electronic media. A number of other British
and foreign agencies and news services have
offices in London (for example, Agence
France Presse), and there are smaller agencies
based in other British cities. Most regional
agencies are members of the National
Association of Press Agencies.
PRESS CONDUCT AND LAW
The Press Complaints Commission
In a free society, there is a delicate and
sometimes difficult balance in the relationship
between the responsibilities of the press and
the rights of the public. The Press Complaints
Commission, a non-statutory body, was set up
in 1991 by the newspaper and periodical
industry in response to growing criticism of
press standards, with allegations of unjustified
invasion of privacy and inaccurate and biased
reporting. A policy of self-regulation under
the Commission, rather than statutory control
or a law of privacy, has since been pursued.
The 16-member Commission is drawn
from both the public and the press and has a
lay majority. It deals with complaints about
the content and conduct of newspapers and
magazines, and operates a Code of Practice
agreed by editors covering inaccuracy,
invasion of privacy, harassment and
discrimination by the press. In 1997 the
Commission dealt with 2,944 complaints,
resolving just under 90% of cases pursued.
The Code of Practice underwent
significant changes in 1997 following the
death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the
concern expressed about media intrusion.
The revisions, which came into effect in
January 1998, include:
• a recognition of everyone’s
entitlement to respect for their
private lives;
• stipulations against the taking of
pictures of people in ‘private places’
(defined as public or private property
where there is reasonable expectation
of privacy);
• a ban on the publication of pictures
obtained as a result of harassment or
‘persistent pursuit’; and
• a requirement that young people
should be free to complete their time at
school without unnecessary intrusion.
The Commission has also extended its
jurisdiction to certain publications on the
Internet (see p. 289). During 1997 the
newspaper industry agreed that the terms of
the Code of Practice should extend to those
publications on the Internet placed there by
publishers who already subscribe to the Code.
The Press and the Law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and
newspaper proprietors, editors and journalists
are subject to the law in the same way as any
other citizen. However, certain statutes
include sections which apply to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies (see p. 273);
• the transfer of newspaper assets; and
• the right of press representatives to be
supplied with agendas and reports of
meetings of local authorities, and
reasonable facilities for taking notes and
telephoning reports.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
the printer’s imprint (the printer’s name and
288
THE MEDIA
address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library (see p. 269).
Publication of advertisements is governed
by wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, copyright, financial services and fraud
legislation. Legal restrictions are imposed on
certain types of prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press.
A newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the courts
for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings; nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such
areas as defence and international relations,
where such unauthorised disclosure would be
harmful, are offences under the Official
Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989. However, these are
restrictions on publication generally, not just
through the printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press are
libel actions brought by private individuals.
Defence Advisory Notices
Government officials and representatives of
the media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which has
agreed that in some circumstances the
publication of certain categories of
information might endanger national security.
Details of these categories are contained in
Defence Advisory Notices (DA Notices)
circulated to the media, whose members are
asked to seek advice from the Secretary of the
Committee, a retired senior military officer,
before publishing information in these areas.
Compliance with any advice offered by the
Secretary is expected, but there is no legal
force behind it and the final decision on
whether to publish rests with the editor,
producer or publisher concerned.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, sales
promotions, cinema, direct mail, and
electronic media such as CD-ROM and the
Internet is regulated by the Advertising
Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA is an
independent body whose role is to ensure that
everyone who prepares and publishes
advertisements conforms to the British Codes
of Advertising and Sales Promotion. The
Codes are written and enforced by the
advertising industry through the Committee
of Advertising Practice (CAP). They require
that advertisements and promotions:
• are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
• are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer and
society; and
• respect the principles of fair competition
generally accepted in business.
The ASA monitors advertisements to
ensure their compliance with the Codes and
investigates any complaints received. Pre¬
publication advice is available to publishers,
agencies and advertisers. If an advertisement
is found to be misleading or offensive, the
ASA can ask the advertiser to change or
remove it. Failure to do so can result in
damaging adverse publicity in the ASA’s
monthly report of its judgments, the refusal of
advertising space by publishers, and the loss of
trading privileges. In the rare cases of
deliberate or persistent offending, the ASA
can also refer misleading advertisements to the
Director General of Fair Trading, who has the
power to seek an injunction to prevent their
publication.
THE MEDIA AND THE INTERNET
The Internet plays an increasingly important
role in the provision and dissemination of
information and entertainment. Broadly, it is a
loose collection of computer networks around
the world—it links thousands of academic,
government, military and public computer
systems, giving millions of people access to a
wealth of stored information and other
resources. No one owns it—there is no
centralised controlling or regulating body. To
access or send out information, an Internet
user needs only a computer with the necessary
289
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
software, a telephone and a modem (which
allows computers to talk to each other over a
telephone line).
The system dates from the 1960s, when it
began life in the military and academic
communities in the United States. It has only
assumed widespread significance in
commercial and consumer terms during the
present decade. It is the World Wide Web
(WWW or Web) which has given the Internet
its user appeal and accessibility. The Web
consists of tens of thousands of pages or ‘sites’
on the Internet, which can be viewed by a
browser (a programme that provides a window
in a computer screen on which the pages are
displayed). Users can move from page to page
in search of whatever information or service
they are after.
For an increasingly computer-literate
generation of consumers, the Internet could
become a real alternative to more traditional
media. Aware of this possibility, many
publishers and broadcasters have established
sites on the World Wide Web. An increasing
number of British press interests have a
presence on the system, among them the Daily
Mail, The Times, The Guardian, The Daily
Telegraph, the Mirror Group, Financial Times
and the Press Association—and also
prominent magazine publishers, like Emap
and IPC. There are over 200 regional
newspaper Websites, offering a range of
editorial, directory and advertising services.
Broadcasters and regulators, including the
BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky and the ITC
are also represented.

UK sportsmen and women hold world titles in a variety of sports, such as
angling, rowing, professional boxing, snooker and motor-cycle sports. The
Government intends to extend opportunities for participation through a national
sports strategy, which will embrace all sections of the community. A new United
Kingdom Sports Institute is to be set up in Sheffield as a centre of excellence for
UK sport. Funding from the National Lottery is making a substantial
contribution towards financing sport, from grass roots to the highest level.
The most popular participation sports or
activities in the UK are walking (including
rambling and hiking), swimming,
snooker/pool/billiards, keep fit/yoga, cycling
and football (see Table 18.1). In 1996-97,
71% of men and 57% of women took part in
at least one sporting activity in the four-week
period before they were interviewed for the
General Household Survey in Great Britain
and the Continuous Household Survey in
Northern Ireland. Participation in sport is also
higher among boys than girls.
Many important sporting events take place
each year in the UK, including the Wimbledon
lawn tennis championships, the Open Golf
championship and the Grand National
steeplechase. In addition, the UK often hosts
other significant events, such as Euro 96, the
final stage of the European football
championship. Forthcoming events include the

A World Class Events Programme, funded
through the National Lottery and co-ordinated
by the United Kingdom Sports Council
(UKSC), has been established to help sports
governing bodies attract and stage major
international events in the UK. The
Government is supporting the Football
Association’s bid to host the football World
Cup in 2006.
SPORTS POLICY
In July 1998 the Government announced a
new structure to support the UK’s top
sportsmen and sportswomen. A ‘Sports
Cabinet’ will be established to identify
strategic priorities for sport. It will be headed
by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media
and Sport and will include the ministers
responsible for sport in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. As the
Scottish Parliament and the Assemblies for
Wales and Northern Ireland come into
operation (see chapters 3-5), the appropriate
member responsible for sport in each country
will take the place of the relevant minister.
The United Kingdom Sports Council
(UKSC—see p. 295) is being strengthened to
provide greater support to the UK’s top
sporting performers.
The Government’s policy is based on
‘Sport for All’ and on achieving international
success. With the assistance of the UKSC, it
is developing a national sports strategy
intended to improve sporting performance at
all levels and to extend opportunities for
participation in sport.
Extending Sporting Opportunities
The Government wishes to ensure that
sporting opportunities are widely available to
the entire community, irrespective of age,
gender, social background, location or ability.
For example, it is keen to improve
opportunities for women in sport, as their
participation has been at a significantly lower
rate than that of men. It also wants the special
problems that prevent those with disabilities
from participating in sport to be addressed.
292
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
The Government is planning to increase
sporting opportunities for young people. A
Youth Sports Unit in the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport is promoting physical
education, sport and play. New after-school
clubs are being encouraged by the Government
as part of the Lottery’s New Opportunities
Fund (see p. 120), and sport and play are two of
the activities expected to be available.
There are several sports initiatives for
young people, including:
• a Sportsmark scheme to recognise
secondary schools that have effective
policies for promoting sport;
• a National Junior Sport Programme in
England, designed to encourage sporting
participation and to develop children’s
sports skills;
• in Scotland, Team Sport Scotland (in
which over 150,000 children have
participated since its inception in 1991), a
youth sport strategy, and ‘Start Young Stay
Active’, a programme to increase levels of
physical activity among young children;
• initiatives run by several sports
governing bodies; and
• a new Sporting Ambassadors Scheme,
launched in July 1998, under which
leading sportsmen and sportswomen will
visit schools to pass on their experiences
to pupils and teachers and to promote
the benefits of a healthy sporting
lifestyle.
School playing fields provide an important
recreational resource, both for the schools
themselves and often for the local
community. In January 1998 the
Government announced measures to
prevent the sale of playing fields in
England. These include tighter planning
controls concerning development on
playing fields owned by local authorities
where the English Sports Council advises
against a development proposal, and
legislation requiring all state schools to
seek consent for the sale of playing fields;
similar measures apply in Scotland.

provides support to help the UK’s most
talented sportsmen and sportswomen compete
successfully at international level. Since its
launch in 1996, grants totalling over £24
million have been made to more than 25 sports
to support elite performers competing up to
Olympic and world championship level.
These funds are available through the
National Lottery Sports Fund (see p. 300).
United Kingdom Sports Institute
A United Kingdom Sports Institute (UKSI) is
being set up under the strategic direction of
the UKSC to provide integrated services
focused on the needs of athletes. Its
headquarters will be in Sheffield and there
will be a network of regional centres in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, with links to centres of excellence for
several individual sports. Although all sports
will have access to the UKSI’s services, the
headquarters site will provide national training
facilities for eight specific sports: athletics,
swimming, cycling, triathlon, judo, netball,
squash and table tennis. The UKSPs funds
will come mainly from the National Lottery.
Detailed arrangements for running the
Institute are being developed by the UKSC.
Construction of the facilities at Sheffield is
due to start in May 1999.
Football
The Football Task Force has been established
to advise on a range of issues affecting football
in England and Wales, including racism,
access for disabled people, ticket prices, and
the effects of growing commercialisation of the
sport. The Government intends to implement
the recommendations in the Task Force’s first
report, on racism. Legislation will be amended
to make racist abuse by individual spectators
an offence.
In 1997 funding of £55 million over the
following four years was announced for the
Football Trust, which provides grant aid to
help football clubs at all levels. This will
enable clubs to complete the safety work
293
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
required by the Government in response to
the Taylor Report following the Hillsborough
stadium disaster in 1989, when 96 spectators
died. In England and Wales, licences issued by
the Football Licensing Authority (FLA)
require all clubs in the Premier League and
those in the First Division of the Football
League to have all-seater grounds. In August
1998 the Government issued a consultative
document containing proposals for a new
Sports Ground Safety Authority, which
would succeed the FLA.
In Scotland the all-seating policy is being
implemented through a voluntary agreement
under the direction of the Scottish football
authorities.
Sport on Television and Radio
Major sporting events receive extensive
television and radio coverage and are watched
or heard by millions of viewers or listeners.
Sports receiving the most coverage on
terrestrial television are football, horse racing,
snooker and cricket. The largest viewing
figure recorded in the UK for a sporting event
was for the England v Argentina football
match in the second round of the 1998 World
Cup, with an average estimated viewing
audience of 23.7 million, peaking at over 26
million for the penalty shoot-out at the end of
the match.
Some major events, such as certain football,
rugby union and cricket matches, are now
shown live only on satellite or cable channels.
However, a number of important ‘listed’ events
are not permitted to be shown on television
solely on pay-per-view or subscription terms
unless they have first been offered to terrestrial
channels. Following a review by an advisory
group on the broadcasting of major sports
events, the Government announced a revised
list in June 1998 (see Table 18.3). Several
events were added to the main list, although
cricket test matches were removed. A new
secondary list is being created (including test
matches), under which live coverage might be
granted to a satellite or cable broadcaster, but
with suitable arrangements for secondary
coverage, such as delayed full coverage or
highlights, by terrestrial channels. In addition,
the Government considers that many World
Cup and European Championship football
qualifying matches involving the home
countries should be available to all viewers, and
it intends to seek suitable Europe-wide
arrangements for live broadcasts of crucial
matches in these competitions.

SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
Sports Councils
Government responsibilities in sport and
recreation are largely channelled through five
Sports Councils:
• the United Kingdom Sports Council
(UKSC);
• the English Sports Council (ESC);
• the Sports Council for Wales;
• the Scottish Sports Council; and
• the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
The UKSC takes the lead on all aspects of
sport and physical recreation which require
strategic planning, administration, co¬
ordination or representation for the UK as a
whole. It is particularly concerned with
providing support for top-level athletes, to
ensure that British sport produces a constant
flow of world-class performers and winners.
In July 1998 the Government announced that
the UKSC would be strengthened. For the
first time, it will be able to distribute funds
available from the National Lottery—
currently only the home country Sports
Councils can do this. It will work alongside
the Sports Cabinet in undertaking its main
functions. These include:
• co-ordinating support to sports in which
the UK competes internationally (as
opposed to the four home countries
separately);
• tackling drug misuse;
• co-ordinating policy for bringing major
international sports events to the UK;
• representing British sporting interests
overseas and increasing influence at
international level; and
• development work on the UKSI.
The home country Sports Councils operate
wide-ranging grant programmes, from
encouraging the development of sport for
young people to developing sporting
excellence on a national basis. They also
manage the National Sports Centres (see
p. 297), and distribute the National Lottery
Sports Fund. The Scottish Sports Council
and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland
have recently produced strategies for the
development of sport in their own countries,
and the Sports Council for Wales is consulting
on a similar strategy for Wales. These plans
will contribute to the development of the
national sports strategy (see p. 292).
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 410
independent governing bodies. Their
functions include drawing up rules, holding
events, regulating membership, and selecting
and training national teams. Governing bodies
receiving long-term funding from the Sports
Councils are required to produce four-year
development plans, from the grass roots to the
highest competitive levels. In order to have
access to Lottery funds, they need to prepare
‘world-class performance’ plans, with specific
performance targets. There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking. Most sports clubs in the UK
belong to, or are affiliated to, an appropriate
governing body.
Other Sports Organisations
The main sports associations in the UK
include:
• The Central Council of Physical
Recreation (CCPR), the largest sport and
recreation federation in the world,
comprises 245 UK bodies and 61 English
associations, most of which are governing
bodies of sport. The Scottish Sports
Association, the Welsh Sports Association
and the Northern Ireland Sports Forum
(NISF) are related associations. Their
primary aim is to represent the interests of
their members to the appropriate national
and local authorities, including the Sports
Councils, from which they receive
funding.
• The British Olympic Association (BOA),
comprising representatives of the 35
national governing bodies of Olympic
295
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
sports, organises the participation of
British teams in the Olympic Games,
determines the size of British Olympic
teams, sets standards for selection and
raises funds. It is supported by
sponsorship and by donations from the
private sector and the general public.
Over 300 competitors represented the
UK in the 1996 Olympics winning 15
medals: one gold, eight silver and six
bronze. The BOA also makes important
contributions to the preparation of
competitors in the period between
Games, such as arranging training camps.
Its British Olympic Medical Centre at
Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow
provides medical services for competitors
before and during the Olympics.
• The Women’s Sports Federation
promotes the interests of women and
girls in sport and active recreation. It
encourages the establishment of women’s
sports groups throughout the UK and
organises events and activities. It runs
both the Sportswomen of the Year
Awards and an annual nationwide awards
scheme for girls and young women
between the ages of 11 and 19.
Sport for Disabled People
The governing bodies of sport are increasingly
taking on responsibility for disabled people.
The Sports Councils provide advice to
governing bodies on encouraging the
integration of people with disabilities. The key
organisations in this area are:
• Disability Sport England, which
organises regional and national
championships in many sports and also
runs training courses, coaching courses
and development days. The Scottish and
the Welsh Sports Associations for the
Disabled and the Northern Ireland
Committee on Sport for People with
Disabilities have similar co-ordinating
roles. In England the ESC is working
with disability organisations to establish
the National Development Agency for
disability sport, which will strive to
integrate disability sport into the
mainstream sporting activities as much as
possible;
• the United Kingdom Sports Association
for People with Learning Disability
(UKSAPLD), a co-ordinating body with
a membership of over 20 national
organisations, which promotes and
develops opportunities in sport and
recreation for people with learning
disability; and
• the British Paralympic Association
(BPA), which organises the UK’s
participation in the Paralympics, in close
liaison with the British Olympic
Association. The UKSAPLD is
responsible, in partnership with the BPA,
for the preparation and training of the
Paralympic team. In 1996, 244
competitors represented the UK in the
Paralympics and won 122 medals: 39
gold, 42 silver and 41 bronze.
In addition, there are bodies concerned with
individual disabilities and single sports.
SPORTS FACILITIES
The UK has a range of world-class sporting
facilities including 13 National Sports
Centres, operated by the Sports Councils.
Manchester will host the Commonwealth
Games in 2002, and funds of £90 million will
be provided for a new sports stadium and £22
million for an Olympic-sized swimming
complex. Other major developments are in
progress or planned at the UKSI (see p. 293)
and Wembley Stadium in London.
National Stadium in England
A new national 80,000 capacity all-seater
stadium for England is to be located at
Wembley. This will involve rebuilding the
existing stadium, and it is expected to be ready
in time for the FA (Football Association) Cup
Final in 2002. The stadium will be capable of
staging major world sporting events, and is to
be the focus of the FA’s bid to host the
football World Cup in 2006. It will cost
around £320 million, of which £120 million
will be provided from Lottery funding. The
stadium will be owned by the English
296
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREA TION
National Stadium Trust, a consortium
including the FA, the Rugby Football League
and the English Sports Council (ESC).
National Sports Centres
First priority at the National Sports Centres is
given to the governing bodies of sport for
national squad training and for the training of
coaches. Centres also make their facilities
available to top sportsmen and women for
individual training and to the local
community. Most Centres provide residential
facilities.
England
The ESC runs six major National Sports
Centres, of which one is in Wales (see below):
• Crystal Palace in London is a leading
competition venue for a wide range of
sports and a major training centre for
national squads, clubs and schools, and
serious enthusiasts. It has a stadium with
capacity for 17,000 spectators, Olympic-
size swimming and diving pools, and a
sports injury centre. It also houses the
National Boxing Academy. Following a
review, the local council, which owns the
Centre, plans to create a centre of
excellence and to refurbish the stadium,
with the assistance of Lottery funding.
• Bisham Abbey in Berkshire caters for a
number of sports, including tennis,
football, hockey, weightlifting, squash,
rugby union and golf. The England
football and rugby union squads train at
the Centre. Bisham Abbey has long¬
standing partnerships with the British
Amateur Weightlifting Association and
the Lawn Tennis Association, which has
helped to develop the Abbey as the
National Tennis Training Centre.
• Lilleshall National Sports Centre in
Shropshire is used by a variety of
national teams. As well as extensive
playing fields for football and hockey,
there are important facilities for archery
and gymnastics.
• The National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire is
one of the most comprehensive water
sports centres in the world. It has
facilities for rowing (including a 2,000-
metre regatta course), canoeing, water-
skiing, powerboating, ski-racing, angling
and sailing.
• The National Cycling Centre is based in
Manchester.
Wales
The Sports Council for Wales runs two
National Sports Centres:
• The Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff
is the country’s premier venue for top-
level training and for competition in
many sports. Facilities include a world-
standard gymnastics hall, a sports science
laboratory and a sports injury clinic.
• The National Watersports Centre at Plas
Menai in north Wales is a centre of
excellence for sailing and canoeing;
activities include dinghy and catamaran
sailing, offshore cruising and powerboat
training.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre,
in Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, is
run by the ESC. It offers courses in rock
climbing, mountaineering, canoeing,
orienteering, skiing and most other mountain-
based activities, and is the UK’s leading
training institution for the development of
mountain instructors.
Scotland
Scotland has three National Sports Centres,
which are run by the Scottish Sports Council
through a wholly owned charitable trust:
• The Scottish National Sports Centre at
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore caters
for a range of activities, including hill
walking, rock climbing, mountaineering,
skiing, kayaking and canoeing. Its main
purpose is to provide top-quality training
for those who intend to lead or instruct
others in outdoor activities.
• The Scottish National Sports Centre—
Inverclyde—at Largs, has a large number
297
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
of indoor and outdoor facilities, including
a gymnastics hall, golf training, sports
medicine, sports science and other
facilities of an international standard.
The Centre also acts as an important
venue for major championships and as a
venue for a range of national teams to
train and compete.
• The Scottish National Water Sports
Centre—Cumbrae—on the island of
Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde,
offers an extensive range of courses
catering for all levels of ability. It has a
comprehensive range of modern craft for
a variety of sailing activities, as well as
sub-aqua diving equipment. Cumbrae
regularly hosts major sailing
championships.
Northern Ireland
The Tollymore Mountain Centre in County
Down, run by the Sports Council for
Northern Ireland, offers courses in
mountaineering, rock climbing, canoeing and
outdoor adventure. Leadership and instructor
courses leading to nationally recognised
qualifications are also available.
A National Sports Training Centre is
under development in Belfast. The first phase,
involving two new synthetic pitches at
Queen’s University of Belfast Playing Fields,
is already in operation.
Local Facilities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the
local community. In England they manage
over 1,500 indoor sports centres. Other
facilities include parks, lakes, playing fields,
tennis courts, artificial pitches, golf courses
and swimming/leisure pools.
Over 150,000 voluntary sports clubs are
affiliated to the national governing bodies of
sport. Some local clubs cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those which
provide sports grounds, particularly for
cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis and
golf. Many clubs linked to business firms cater
for sporting activities. Commercial facilities
include fitness centres, tenpin bowling
centres, ice and roller-skating rinks, squash
courts, golf courses and driving ranges, riding
stables and marinas.
SUPPORT SERVICES
Sports Medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute
(NSMI), funded by the UKSC and ESC, is
responsible for the co-ordination of sports
medicine services. Based at the medical college
of St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, its
facilities include a physiology laboratory,
library and information centre.
In Scotland a network of 26 accredited
sports medicine centres provides specialist
help with sports injuries. The Scottish
Institute of Sports Medicine and Sports
Science aims to form partnerships with
national governing bodies to provide athletes
and coaches with high-quality medical and
scientific support.
The Northern Ireland Sports Medicine
Centre, established in 1996, is a partnership
between the Sports Council for Northern
Ireland and a local healthcare trust.
Sports Science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is being promoted by the Sports Councils,
in collaboration with the British Olympic
Association and the National Coaching
Foundation, in an effort to raise the standards of
performance of national squads. The type of
support provided may cover biomechanical
(human movement), physiological or
psychological factors. There are 24 national
governing bodies involved in the UKSC’s
Sports Science Support Programme.
Coaching
The National Coaching Foundation works
closely with sports governing bodies, local
authorities, and higher and further education.
Supported by the Sports Councils, it provides
a comprehensive range of education and
development services for coaches in all sports.
Its Champion Coaching scheme provides
after-school coaching in a variety of sports in
298
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In
1998-99 there will be 130 local authority
schemes, with about 10,000 children and 2,000
coaches participating. In Scotland the Scottish
Sports Council’s scheme to support coaching
is Coaching Scotland.
Future Arrangements
The organisation and delivery of sports
medicine, sports science and coaching services
are expected to change significantly as a result
of the development of the United Kingdom
Sports Institute. The NSMI and the National
Coaching Foundation are working towards
integration with the UKSI. In addition, sports
representatives, under the leadership of the
UKSC, are looking at the requirements of
their sports for support services.
DRUG MISUSE
The UKSC aims to prevent doping in sport
and achieve a commitment to drug-free sport
and ethical sporting practices. Its Ethics and
Anti-Doping Directorate co-ordinates a
drugs-testing programme and conducts a
comprehensive education programme aimed at
changing attitudes to drug misuse. Samples
are analysed at a laboratory accredited by the
International Olympic Committee, at King’s
College, University of London; the UKSC is
responsible for reporting the results to the
appropriate governing body. The drugs-
testing programme involves nearly 80 national
governing bodies and 24 international sporting
federations from 47 sports. In 1997-98, 4,564
tests were conducted—2,918 in competition
and 1,646 out of competition—and just over
98% were negative. The UKSC provides a
Drug Information Line to allow athletes to
check whether a licensed medication is
permitted or banned under their governing
body’s regulations, and in March 1998
published a comprehensive guide on drugs
and sport for competitors and officials.
SPONSORSHIP AND OTHER
FUNDING
Sport is a major industry in the UK. In
addition to professional sportsmen and women,
around 400,000 people are employed in the
provision of sports clothing, publicity, ground
and club maintenance and other activities
connected with sport. Consumer expenditure
on sports goods and activities in the UK is over
£10,000 million a year. The private sector
makes a substantial investment in sport, with
more than 2,000 UK companies involved.
The sports sponsorship market was
estimated to be worth nearly £322 million in
1997, almost 7% higher than in 1996. A
record 996 sponsorship deals were reported
during the year, with the highest number
(163) from the drinks industry.
Tobacco sponsorship of sport is to cease
within the next five to seven years, under
the EC’s Tobacco Advertising Directive
(see p. 188). Sports are trying to find new
sponsors for events formerly sponsored by
the tobacco industry. The Government is
considering a range of options for helping
sport to adapt to the loss of tobacco
sponsorship.
Sponsorship may take the form of financing
specific events or championships, such as horse
races or cricket leagues, or of grants to sports
organisations or individual performers. Motor
sport and football receive the largest amounts of
private sponsorship. Sponsorship is encouraged
by a number of bodies, including:
• the Institute of Sports Sponsorship (ISS),
which comprises some 100 UK companies
involved in sponsoring sport; and
• the Sports Sponsorship Advisory
Service, administered jointly by the
CCPR and the ISS, and funded by the
ESC, and similar advisory services of the
Scottish Sports Council and the Sports
Council for Wales.
Sportsmatch
Sportsmatch aims to increase the amount of
business sponsorship going into grass roots
sport and physical recreation. It offers
matching funding for new sponsorships and
extension of existing ones. Priority is given to
projects involving the young, disabled people
299
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and ethnic minorities and to projects in
deprived areas.
In England the ISS runs the scheme on
behalf of the Department for Culture, Media
and Sport. Since 1992 Sportsmatch has
approved over 2,200 awards in England,
totalling £17.6 million and covering about 70
different sports. Football, rugby union, cricket,
tennis and basketball have received most
awards. Minority sports, such as orienteering
and trampolining, have also received awards.
About half the companies involved are
sponsoring sport for the first time.
In Scotland and Wales the scheme is
managed by the appropriate Sports Council’s
Sponsorship Advisory Service.
National Lottery Awards
Sport is one of the main recipients of funds
raised by the National Lottery. By June 1998
awards totalling over £800 million had been
made to some 4,000 projects in the UK. Around
50 sports have received Lottery funding, with
projects ranging from the provision of small
items of equipment to the building of major
sports venues. The more general benefits of
funding from the Lottery are beginning to be
realised in, for example, greatly increased
participation in sport by young people under 18,
women and disabled people.
Some of the funds from the Millennium
Commission (see p. 120) are also for sporting
and recreational developments. Major
schemes include:
• £46 million for the Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff, which will be ready for the
1999 Rugby World Cup (see p. 309);
• £42.5 million for a new national cycle
network (see p. 365); and
• £23 million towards the redevelopment
of the national football stadium in
Scotland at Hampden Park (Glasgow).
SportsAid
Sports Aid (the Sports Aid Foundation) raises
funds to help talented young British
sportspeople to meet their personal training
expenses and realise their sporting potential.
Assistance is given to those needing financial
help and is concentrated on individuals who
do not qualify for awards from the National
Lottery Sports Fund. SportsAid raises its
funds by commercial sponsorship and by
donations from companies, local authorities,
voluntary organisations and members of the
public. Scottish SportsAid, SportsAid Wales
and the Ulster Sports and Recreation Trust
have similar functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up by the football pools promoters in 1991
to channel funds into sport and the arts. This
initiative followed the 1991 Budget, in which
pool betting duty was reduced by 2.5%,
provided that the money forgone by the
Government was paid into the new
Foundation. The pools promoters also pass on
an additional 5 pence in the pound levy on
pools coupons to the Foundation. The
Foundation has made awards to schemes
benefiting over 100 sports.
Betting and Gaming
Most betting in Great Britain takes place on
horse racing and greyhound racing. Bets may
be placed with on-course bookmakers at
racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through
about 8,500 licensed off-course betting offices.
A form of pool betting—totalisator betting—is
organised on racecourses by the Horserace
Totalisator Board (the Tote), which also has a
number of off-course betting offices. Betting
on other sporting events, such as football, is
becoming more popular.
A proportion of betting turnover by
bookmakers and the Tote is returned to the
racing industry through an annual levy. The
levy is based on a scheme agreed each year
between the Bookmakers’ Committee and the
Horserace Betting Levy Board. If agreement
cannot be reached, it is determined by the
Home Secretary. The Levy Board distributes
the levy to promote the improvement of horse
breeds, and for the advancement of veterinary
science and the improvement of horse racing.
Gross expenditure on all forms of
gambling, including the National Lottery, is
estimated at approximately £40,000 million a
year. Various measures have been taken in
300
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
recent years to provide new opportunities for
the betting and gaming industry and the
consumer. These include relaxation on
membership conditions of casinos (of which
there are around 115 in Great Britain), and
broadcast advertising of commercial bingo.
POPULAR SPORTS
Some of the major sports in the UK, many of
which were invented by the British, are
described below.
Angling
Angling is one of the most popular sports.
There are an estimated 3 million anglers in the
UK. In England and Wales the most widely
practised form of angling is for coarse fish
(freshwater fish other than salmon or trout).
The rivers and lochs of Scotland and in Wales
are the main areas for salmon and trout fishing.
Separate organisations represent game, coarse
and sea fishing clubs in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, and there are
separate competitions in each of the three
angling disciplines. A number of options for a
national centre for angling are under discussion
by the governing bodies; the ESC has indicated
that it will consider a bid for Lottery funding
and also provide advice and assistance.
The UK has several world champion
anglers—in 1997 Alan Scotthorne and Wendy
Locker won the world freshwater fishing
championships and England took the women’s
team title, while Joe Arch won the world shore
championships (which were held at Dover)
and Wales took the men’s team title in the
latter event. England won the team and
individual gold medals in the 1998 world
youth championships.
Athletics
In the UK athletics covers a wide range of
activities, including track and field events,
cross country and road running, race walking,
and fell and hill running. One of the major
developments has been the significant growth
in mass participation events, notably
marathons and half marathons. The largest
UK marathon is the London Marathon each
April, with nearly 30,700 runners taking part
in the 1998 event. The Great North Run, a
half marathon, takes place between Newcastle
upon Tyne and South Shields, and in October
1998 attracted 40,000 runners. In these and
other similar events, many runners are
sponsored, raising considerable amounts for
charities and other good causes.
British athletes held world records in two
events in September 1998: Jonathan Edwards
in the triple jump, achieved in 1995 when he
became the first man to jump beyond 18
metres; and Colin Jackson in the 110 metre
hurdles (achieved in 1991). British athletes
won six medals in the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, with silver medals for Jonathan
Edwards and for Roger Black (400 metres),
Steve Backley (javelin) and the men’s 4 x 400
metres relay team (Jamie Baulch, Roger Black,
Mark Richardson and Iwan Thomas); and
bronze medals for Denise Lewis (heptathlon)
and Steve Smith (high jump). Paula Radcliffe
finished second in the 8 km long course
event at the 1998 world cross-country
championships in Marrakesh. In 1998 the
British men’s team won the European Cup in
St Petersburg to qualify for the athletics
World Cup in Johannesburg, where the
team finished sixth. At the European
championships in Budapest in August 1998
the British team won nine gold medals, more
than any other nation.
UK Athletics 98 has operated as an interim
governing body succeeding the British
Athletic Federation (which ceased operation
in 1997 as a result of financial difficulties).
Following a vote on proposed new permanent
arrangements, a new governing body—
Athletics UK—will be set up from
January 1999.
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the
Badminton Association of England and the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch)
Badminton Unions. Around 5 million people
play badminton in the UK and there are over
301
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
5,000 clubs. The Badminton Association of
England has a coach education system to
develop coaches for players of all levels.
The world championships were held in
Glasgow in 1997. The All England Badminton
Championships, staged at the National Indoor
Arena in Birmingham, is a leading tournament
in the world grand prix circuit.
A mini version of the game—Short
Badminton—and badminton for disabled
people have been introduced in recent years.
Basketball
Over 3 million people participate in basketball
in the UK. The English Basketball Association
is the governing body in England, with similar
associations in Wales, Scotland and Ireland
(Ulster Branch). All the associations are
represented in the British and Irish Basketball
Federation, which acts as the co-ordinating
body for the UK and the Irish Republic.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues, which cover four divisions
for men and two for women, while there are
also leagues for younger players. Mini¬
basketball has been developed for players
under the age of 13. Wheelchair basketball is
played under the same rules, with a few basic
adaptations, and on the same court as the
running game.
The English Basketball Association runs
various development schemes for young
people which aim to increase participation and
improve the quality of basketball throughout
England. With support from National Lottery
funds, some 6,000 outdoor basketball goals
have been installed in parks and play areas in
England under a scheme to encourage
recreational participation in the sport, and a
further 4,000 will be installed in 1999.
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn (flat
green and crown green) and indoor bowls.
About 4,000 lawn bowling clubs are affiliated
to the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish
Bowling Associations, which, together with
Women’s Bowling Associations for the four
countries, play to the rules of the World Bowls
Board. Crown green bowls and indoor bowls
have their own separate associations. The
World Bowls Tour now organises bowls at the
professional level.
British bowlers have achieved considerable
success in international championships. At the
world outdoor championships (held every four
years) the winners at the most recent event,
held in Adelaide in 1996, included Tony
Allcock, who became the first man to defend
the singles title successfully, and Scotland,
winners of the overall team title. At the 1998
world indoor championships, held in Preston,
Paul Foster won the singles event, while
Richard Corsie and Graham Robertson won
the pairs title.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the rules
established by the Marquess of Queensberry in
1865. In the UK boxing is both amateur and
professional, and in both strict medical
regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England is controlled
by the Amateur Boxing Association of England.
There are separate associations in Scotland and
Wales, and boxing in Northern Ireland is
controlled by the Irish Amateur Boxing
Association. The associations organise amateur
boxing championships as well as training
courses for referees, coaches and others.
Headguards must be used in all UK amateur
competitions.
Professional boxing in the UK is controlled
by the British Boxing Board of Control. The
Board appoints referees, timekeepers,
inspectors, medical officers and representatives
to ensure that regulations are observed, and that
boxing contests take place under carefully
regulated conditions. Medical controls and
safety measures must be in place at all licensed
tournaments, to minimise the risk to boxers.
The Board nominates challengers for British
championships and represents the interests of
British licensed boxers in the international
championship bodies of which it is a member.
The UK currently has six world champions:
Naseem Hamed, who holds the World Boxing
Organisation (WBO) featherweight title;
heavyweights Lennox Lewis (who holds the
World Boxing Council—WBC—version) and
302
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Herbie Hide (WBO); super-middleweights Joe
Calzaghe (WBO) and Richie Woodhall (WBC);
and Carl Thompson (WBO cruiserweight).
Cricket
The earliest extant set of laws for cricket, which
was first played in south-east England, is dated
1744. The rules of the game became the
responsibility, in the 18th century, of the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), based at
Lord’s cricket ground in north London, and it
still frames the laws today. The England and
Wales Cricket Board (ECB), established in
1997, now administers men’s cricket in England
and Wales, and became responsible for women’s
cricket following a vote in March 1998 by the
Women’s Cricket Association to merge with the
ECB. The Scottish Cricket Union administers
cricket in Scotland.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages. Throughout
the UK there is a network of cricket consisting
of first-class, minor counties and club games
with a variety of leagues. The main competition
in professional cricket is the County
Championship, played by 18 first-class county
teams in four-day matches. Three main one-day
competitions were held in 1998: the Benson &
Hedges Cup, the NatWest Trophy and the
AXA League. A number of changes are planned
for 1999, including a new knockout cup
replacing the Benson & Hedges Cup and
involving the top eight counties in the County
Championship in 1998, and a new National
League, with two divisions, to succeed the AXA
League.
Every year there is a series of five-day
Cornhill Insurance Test matches played
between England and one or more touring
teams from Australia, India, New Zealand,
Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West
Indies or Zimbabwe. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these
countries in the UK winter. England will host
the 1999 World Cup, involving 12 countries.
Cycling
Cycling, one of the UK’s fastest growing
activities, includes road and track racing,
time-trialling, cyclo-cross (cross country
racing), touring and bicycle moto-cross
(BMX). All-terrain or mountain bikes are
increasingly popular.
The British Cycling Federation has 14,000
members and is the internationally recognised
governing body for British cycling as a sport.
The Road Time Trials Council (to which over
1,000 cycling clubs are affiliated) controls road
time trials. The CTC (Cyclists’ Touring
Club), with 65,000 members and affiliates, is
the governing body for recreational and urban
cycling, and holds the CTC rally each year in
York. CTC Scotland represents cyclists in
Scotland, Wales has its own Cyclists’ Union
and Northern Ireland also has separate
federations for competitive cycling.
A new Tour of Britain race was held for
the first time in May 1998. Sponsored by
Prudential, the 1998 ‘Prutour’ started in
Edinburgh and finished in London, with
eight daily stages and an initial time trial
(held at Stirling). The event attracted large
numbers of spectators.
Chris Boardman (runner-up in the
Prutour) is the UK’s most successful current
cyclist. He won the 4,000 metres pursuit title
at the World Cycling Championships in 1996
and was one of two UK bronze medallists in
cycling—along with Max Sciandri—at the
Atlanta Olympics.
Equestrianism
Leading horse trials, comprising dressage,
cross-country and show jumping, are held at a
number of locations. The Badminton Horse
Trials is one of the UK’s largest sporting
events, attracting around 250,000 spectators.
The major show jumping events include the
Horse of the Year Show at Wembley in
London and the Hickstead Derby in West
Sussex.
The British Equestrian Federation (BEF)
acts as the international secretariat on behalf of
its members, which include the British Show
Jumping Association, the British Horse Trials
Association, British Dressage, British Horse
Driving Trials Association, British Endurance
303
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Riding Association and British Equestrian
Vaulting. These associations act as the
governing bodies of the different sporting
disciplines in the UK and oversee the
organisation of the major national and
international events. The British Horse
Society, which includes British Riding Clubs, is
responsible for promoting training, road safety,
rights of way and the welfare of horses, while
the Pony Club provides training for children.
The British team has won medals in the
three-day event at the two most recent World
Equestrian Games, winning the team title in
1994, while the team of Karen Dixon, Gary
Parsonage, Polly Phillipps and Nigel Taylor
took the bronze medal in the 1998 Games held
in Rome. The show jumping team of Geoff
Billington, Di Lampard, Nick Skelton and
John Whitaker also won a bronze medal in the
1998 Games.
Exercise and Fitness
Exercise and fitness is a term covering a
variety of activities, such as exercise to music,
aqua exercise, weight training, step exercise
and circuit training, which aim to improve
health and fitness. The Exercise Association of
England is the national governing body in
England, and aims to promote a positive and
broad-based approach to sport and health. It is
the custodian of the Exercise and Fitness
Register, which lists qualified
teachers/instructors, and is designed to
protect the public by raising standards and
promoting codes of practice. The Keep Fit
Association (KFA), which has 1,500 teachers
and a membership of 12,000, promotes fitness
through movement, exercise and dance for
people of all ages and abilities. Its national
certificated training scheme for KFA teachers
is recognised by local education authorities
throughout the UK. Autonomous associations
serve Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Field Sports
Field sports in the UK include hunting,
shooting, stalking and hare coursing. Fox
hunting with a pack of hounds is the most
popular hunting sport. There are over 300
recognised packs of quarry hounds in the UK,
of which more than 180 are foxhound packs
recognised by the Masters of Fox Hounds
Association. A number of hunts organise ‘point-
to-point’ race meetings (see p. 306).
The Countryside Alliance promotes the
interests of field sports. There has been
considerable public discussion about field sports.
A private member’s Bill seeking to ban hunting
with hounds received a second reading in the
House of Commons in 1997, with a substantial
majority in favour, but did not become law
owing to a lack of parliamentary time.
Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
340 clubs are affiliated to the Football
Association (FA) and more than 42,000 clubs
to regional or district associations. The FA,
founded in 1863, and the Football League,
founded in 1888, were both the first of their
kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78 full
and associate clubs and nearly 6,000 registered
clubs under the jurisdiction of the Scottish
Football Association.
A new FA Premier League was started in
England in 1992 and now comprises 20 clubs.
A further 72 full-time professional clubs play
in three main divisions run by the Football
League. During the season, which lasts from
August until May, over 2,000 English League
matches are played. A £40 million scheme has
been introduced to establish new centres of
excellence for coaching and developing young
players, with a contribution of £20 million
from the FA Premier League being matched
by £20 million from the English Sports
Council’s Lottery Fund.
Three Welsh clubs play in the Football
League, while the National League of Wales
contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In
Scotland a new Scottish Premier League, with
ten clubs, held its first fixtures in August
1998. A further 30 clubs play in the Scottish
Football League, equally divided into three
divisions. In Northern Ireland, 16 semi-
professional clubs play in the Irish Football
League.
The major annual knock-out competitions
are the FA Cup (sponsored by AXA) and the
304
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
League Cup (the Worthington Cup) in
England, the Tennents Scottish Cup, the
Scottish League Cup, the Irish Cup and the
Welsh FA Cup.
Football has seen an influx of money
during the 1990s, particularly into the top
clubs (such as Arsenal, Manchester United,1
Rangers and Celtic). More leading
international footballers—from most
European countries, and from South America,
Africa, Australia and elsewhere—are now
playing in the top divisions. Domestic
footballers feature strongly among the UK’s
highest paid sports performers, with several
receiving over £1 million a year (including their
earnings from sponsorship).
Euro 96, the final stage of the European
Championship, was the biggest football
tournament to have been held in the UK since
the 1966 World Cup. Following the success of
the event, the FA announced its intention of
putting in a bid to host the World Cup in 2006.
Both England and Scotland played in the final
stage of the 1998 World Cup in France, with
England reaching the second round.
Chelsea won the European Cup Winners’
Cup Final in May 1998.
Gaelic Games
Gaelic Games, increasingly popular in
Northern Ireland, cover the sports of Gaelic
football, handball, hurling, camogie (women’s
hurling) and rounders. There are over 700
clubs in Northern Ireland affiliated to the
Gaelic Athletic Association and the Camogie
Council, the official governing bodies
responsible for Gaelic Games.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland and since 1897 the
rules have been administered worldwide by the
Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R & A), which is
situated at St Andrews. The Golfing Union of
Ireland and parallel unions in Wales, Scotland
1 In September 1998 the media group BSkyB put in a
takeover bid for Manchester United, which has been
referred for consideration by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
and England are the national governing bodies
for men’s amateur golf. These bodies are
affiliated to the R & A and are represented on
the Council of National Golf Unions, which is
the UK co-ordinating body responsible for
handicapping and organising home international
matches. Women’s amateur golf in Great
Britain is governed by the Ladies’ Golf Union.
Club professional golf is governed by the
Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) and
tournament golf by the European PGA Tour
and the European Ladies Professional Golfers’
Association. Women’s golf in Scotland and
Northern Ireland is governed by the Scottish
Ladies Golf Association and the Irish Ladies
Golf Union respectively.
The main tournament of the British golfing
year is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s four ‘major’ events. Other important
events include the World Matchplay
Championship at Wentworth; the Walker Cup
and Curtis Cup matches for amateurs, played
between Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States; and the Ryder Cup and Solheim
Cup matches for men and women professionals
respectively, played every two years between
Europe and the United States. Europe retained
the Ryder Cup in 1997, at Valderrama (Spain).
There are over 2,000 golf courses in the UK.
Some of the most famous include St Andrews,
Royal Lytham and St Anne’s, Muirfield and
Royal Birkdale (which staged the 1998 British
Open Championship).
Nick Faldo won the US Masters
tournament at Augusta in 1996, his third win in
the event and his sixth ‘major’ title. Colin
Montgomerie headed the European list of
money winners in 1998 for the sixth year
running and finished second in the 1997 US
Open. Overseas events won recently by UK
golfers include the 1998 French Open (Sam
Torrance) and the 1997 Australian Open and
1998 US Tournament Players Championship
(Lee Westwood). In the women’s game Alison
Nicholas won the US Women’s Open in 1997.
The English boys team won the world junior
golf championship in June 1998.
Greyhound Racing
Greyhound racing is one of the UK’s most
popular spectator sports, with about 5 million
305
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
spectators a year. The rules for the sport are
drawn up by the National Greyhound Racing
Club (NGR.C), the sport’s judicial and
administrative body. The representative body is
the British Greyhound Racing Board.
Meetings are usually held three times a week
at each track, with at least ten races a meeting.
The main event of the year is the Greyhound
Derby, run in June at Wimbledon Stadium,
London. Tracks are licensed by local
authorities. There are 33 major tracks that
operate under the rules of the NGRC and
around 45 smaller tracks.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into five main
disciplines: artistic (or Olympic) gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics,
general gymnastics and sports aerobics.
The governing body for the sport is British
Gymnastics. Over the past decade the number
of affiliated clubs has nearly doubled. The
sport is particularly popular with
schoolchildren and young adults. It is
estimated that between 3 and 4 million
schoolchildren take part in some form of
gymnastics every day.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games cover a wide range
of athletic competitions, including running,
cycling, and dancing. The heavyweight events
are the most popular and include throwing the
hammer, tossing the caber and putting the
shot. Over 70 gatherings of various kinds take
place throughout Scotland, the most famous
being the annual Braemar Gathering.
The Scottish Games Association is the
official governing body responsible for athletic
sports and games at Highland and Border
events in Scotland.
Hockey
The modern game of hockey was founded in
England in 1886. A single association—the
England Hockey Association—was formed in
1997 to govern men’s and women’s hockey in
England; there are similar single associations
in Scotland and Wales. Cup competitions and
leagues exist at national, divisional or district,
club and school levels, both indoors (six-a¬
side) and outdoors, and there are regular
international matches and tournaments. A
National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes,
opened in 1996, is now the venue for all major
hockey matches in England.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two main forms—flat
racing and National Hunt (steeplechasing and
hurdle) racing. The turf flat race season lasts
from late March to early November, but all-
weather flat racing and National Hunt racing
take place throughout the year. The UK has
59 racecourses and about 12,000 horses
currently in training. Point-to-point racing,
restricted to amateur riders on horses which
are qualified by going hunting, takes place
between January and June, and is growing in
popularity.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the 2,000 Guineas and
the 1,000 Guineas, both held at Newmarket;
the Oaks (Epsom); and the St Leger
(Doncaster). The meeting at Royal Ascot in
June is another significant flat racing event.
The most important National Hunt meeting is
the National Hunt Festival held at
Cheltenham in March, which features the
Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, is the world’s best-known
steeplechase and dates from 1839.
The responsibilities of the British
Horseracing Board (BHB), the governing
authority for racing, include the fixture list,
race programmes, relations with the
Government and the betting industry, and
central marketing. In 1998 the BHB produced a
financial plan designed to safeguard the future
of the racing industry. The Jockey Club, as the
regulatory authority, is responsible for
licensing, discipline and security.
Ice Hockey
Ice hockey is a significant indoor spectator
sport, with over 2 million spectators each
306
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
season and attendances growing. Eight teams
contest the British Superleague, and 16 the
Benson & Hedges Cup. A further eight teams
take part in the British National League, run
by the British Ice Hockey Association, while
ten teams are involved in the English Premier
League. There are around 7,500 players in the
UK.
Ice Skating
Ice skating has four main disciplines: ice figure
(single and pairs), ice dance, speed skating and
synchronised skating. Participation in ice
skating is concentrated among the under-25s,
and is one of the few sports that attracts more
female than male participants. The governing
body is the National Ice Skating Association of
UK Ltd, to which 75 clubs are affiliated.
There are 68 rinks in the UK, with plans in
hand for a number of new rinks. A £16 million
project for a new ice arena in Sheffield will
receive funding from the National Lottery
Sports Fund.
Judo
Judo is popular not only as a competitive sport
and self-defence technique, but also as a
means of general fitness training. An
internationally recognised grading system is in
operation through the sport’s governing body,
the British Judo Association. In 1997 Kate
Howey won the world middleweight title. The
world championships in 1999 will be staged in
Birmingham.
Martial Arts
Various martial arts, mainly derived from the
Far East, are practised in the UK. There are
recognised governing bodies for karate, ju¬
jitsu, aikido, Chinese martial arts, kendo,
taekwondo and tang soo do. The most popular
martial art is karate, with over 100,000
participants.
Motor-car Sports
The main four-wheeled motor sports include
motor racing, autocross, rallycross, rallying
and karting. In motor racing the Formula 1
Grand Prix World Championship is the major
form of the sport.
The governing body for four-wheeled
motor sport in the UK is the Royal
Automobile Club Motor Sports Association.
The Association issues licences for a variety of
competitions. It also organises the Rally of
Great Britain, an event in the World Rally
Championship, and the British Grand Prix,
which is held at Silverstone as part of the
Formula 1 World Championship.
The UK has had more Formula 1 world
champions than any other country. The most
recent is Damon Hill (son of Graham Hill, a
previous world champion), who won the 1996
World Championship and has won 22 Grand
Prix.
UK car constructors, including McLaren
and Williams, have enjoyed outstanding
success in Grand Prix racing and many other
forms of racing. Most of the cars in Formula 1
have been designed, developed and built in the
UK. The UK motor sport industry is
estimated to generate an annual turnover of
over £1,000 million (of which exports account
for 60%) and to employ more than 50,000
people.
In 1995 Colin McRae became the first UK
driver to win the World Rally Championship;
he finished second in 1996 and 1997.
Motor-cycle Sports
Motor-cycle sports include road racing, moto-
cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag
racing, enduro (endurance off-road racing)
and sprint. There are between 40,000 and
50,000 competitive motor cyclists in the UK.
The governing bodies of the sport are the
Auto-Cycle Union in England and Wales, the
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and the Motor
Cycle Union of Ireland (in Northern Ireland).
The major events of the year include the Isle
of Man TT races and the British Road Race
Grand Prix. The Auto-Cycle Union also
provides off-road training by approved
instructors for riders of all ages.
Carl Fogarty has had considerable success
in the World Superbike Championships. In
1998 he won the event for the third time,
following successes in 1994 and 1995, and in
307
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
1997 he finished runner-up. Steve Webster
and David James won the world sidecar title in
1998.
Mountaineering
The representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council (BMC), which works
closely with the Mountaineering Councils of
Scotland and Ireland. The main areas of work
include access and conservation. Climbing is
one of the fastest growing sports in the UK.
The BMC estimates that the number of active
participants is around 150,000, not including
the many hill walkers. There are over 300
mountaineering and climbing clubs in the
UK, and three National Centres for
mountaineering activities run by the Sports
Councils (see pp. 297-8).
UK mountaineers have played a leading
role in exploring the world’s great mountain
ranges. The best-known is Sir Chris
Bonington, who has climbed Everest and led
many other expeditions.
Netball
More than 60,000 adults play netball regularly
in England and a further 1 million young
people play in schools. The sport is played
almost exclusively by women and girls.
The All England Netball Association is the
governing body in England, with Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland having their own
separate organisations. National competitions
are staged annually for all age-groups.
Rowing
Rowing is taught in many schools, universities
and rowing clubs throughout the UK. The
main types of boats are single, pairs and double
sculls, fours and eights. The governing body in
England is the Amateur Rowing Association;
similar bodies regulate the sport in Scotland,
Wales and Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge, has
been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession. At
the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire crews from
all over the world compete each July in various
kinds of race over a straight course of 1 mile
550 yards (about 2.1 km).
Steven Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent won
the gold medal in the coxless pairs in both the
1992 and 1996 Olympics. Steven Redgrave has
won four successive Olympic gold medals, a
feat achieved by only a very few people in
Olympic history. They have now joined up
with one of the team who won a bronze medal
in 1996 in the coxless fours—Tim Foster—and
with James Cracknell to form a new coxless
four with the long-term aim of competing in
the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000. They
won one of three gold medals for the UK at the
world championships in Cologne in September
1998, with the women’s lightweight pair of
Juliet Machan and Jo Nitsch and the women’s
double scullers Miriam Batten and Gillian
Lindsay also winning gold.
Rugby League
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby union
(see below) of 22 clubs in the north of England,
where the sport is still concentrated. In the UK
there are 31 professional clubs, with about 1,000
professional players, and some 400 amateur
clubs with a total of around 40,000 players.
The governing body of the professional
game is the Rugby Football League, while the
amateur game is governed by the British
Amateur Rugby League Association. The
major domestic club match of the season is the
Challenge Cup Final, played at Wembley
Stadium in London.
Rugby league was transformed in 1996 with
the creation of a Super League and a switch to
playing in the summer. This consists of 12
clubs: 11 from the north of England and one
from London. There are two other divisions:
the First Division, with 11 clubs, and the
Second, with eight clubs.
Rugby Union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game) is
thought to have originated at Rugby School in
308
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
the first half of the 19th century. The sport is
played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (RFU) in England and parallel
bodies in Wales, Scotland and Ireland (Ulster
Branch). Each of the four countries has
separate national league and knock-out
competitions for its domestic clubs.
An annual Five Nations Championship is
contested by England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland (a team from the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland) and France. From
1999-2000 it will become the Six Nations
Championship when Italy joins the
competition. Overseas tours are undertaken by
the national sides and by the British Lions, a
team representing Great Britain and Ireland.
Tours to the UK are made by teams
representing the major rugby-playing nations.
The Rugby World Cup is held every four
years. Wales has been selected by the
International Rugby Board to host the finals of
the 1999 World Cup. The Cardiff Arms Park
Stadium is being substantially rebuilt in time
for this event, with a significant financial
contribution from the Millennium
Commission (see p. 120). Other matches in
the competition will be shared among
England, Scotland, Ireland and France.
Bath became European club champions
when they won the Heineken Cup in January
1998, beating Brive of France in the final.
Skiing and Other Winter Sports
Skiing takes place in Scotland from
December to May and also at several English
locations when there is sufficient snow. The
five established winter sports areas in
Scotland are Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee,
the Lecht and Nevis Range. All have a full
range of ski-lifts, prepared ski-runs and
professional instructors.
There are over 115 artificial or dry ski-
slopes throughout the UK, and 1.5 million
people take part in the sport. The British Ski
and Snowboard Federation is the
representative body for international
competitive skiing and snowboarding. The
four home country ski councils are
responsible for the development of the sport,
mainly through coaching, race training and
arranging competitions.
The four-man bobsleigh team of Sean
Olsson, Dean Ward, Paul Attwood and
Courtney Rumbolt won a bronze medal at the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano in Japan.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker was invented by the British in India
in 1875 and is played by approximately 7
million people in the UK. British players have
an outstanding record and have dominated the
major professional championships. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World
Professional Championship, held in Sheffield.
In 1998 the winner was John Higgins, who
became the world’s number one player,
succeeding Stephen Hendry, who had won the
world title six times during the 1990s.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game in England is the English
Association for Snooker and Billiards.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
separate associations. The World Professional
Billiards and Snooker Association organises all
world-ranking professional events and holds
the copyright for the rules. The representative
body for women is the World Ladies’ Billiards
and Snooker Association.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets,
which was invented at Harrow School in the
1850s. The governing body for squash in
England is the Squash Rackets Association;
there are separate governing bodies in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The British
Open Championships is one of the major
world events in the sport.
The number of players in the UK is
estimated at over 2 million, of whom more
than 500,000 compete regularly in inter-club
league competitions. There are nearly 9,000
squash courts in England, provided mainly by
squash clubs, commercial organisations and
local authorities.
In mid-1998 Peter Nicol was ranked
number one in the world, and in April 1998
was the first UK winner of the British Open
for 25 years. He also finished runner-up in the
1997 World Championship in Kuala Lumpur.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
In 1997 England retained the World Team
Championships when the team beat Canada in
the final. The England team consisted of Del
Harris, Peter Marshall, Simon Parke and Chris
Walker. In May 1998 the UK had ten men and
eight women in the respective top 20 world
rankings.
Swimming
Swimming is a popular sport and form of
exercise for people from all age-groups.
Competitive swimming is governed by the
Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) in
England and by similar associations in Scotland
and Wales. Together these three associations
form the Amateur Swimming Federation of
Great Britain, which co-ordinates the selection
of Great Britain teams and organises
international competitions. Northern Ireland
forms part of the Irish Amateur Swimming
Association. Instruction and coaching are
provided by qualified teachers and coaches who
hold certificates awarded mainly by the ASA.
In the 1996 Olympics Paul Palmer gained a
silver medal in the 400 metres freestyle and
Graeme Smith a bronze medal in the 1,500
metres freestyle. At the world swimming
championships held in January 1998 in Perth
(Australia), Paul Palmer won a bronze medal in
the 400 metres freestyle, and the 4 x 200 metres
freestyle relay team also won a bronze. James
Hickman took first place in the 200 metres
butterfly at the World Short Course
Championships in Gothenburg in 1997.
Table Tennis
Table tennis was developed in England in the
second half of the 19th century. It is played in
a variety of venues (ranging from small halls to
multi-table, purpose-built table tennis centres)
and by all age-groups. The sport is also a
major recreational and competitive activity for
people with disabilities. The governing body
in England is the English Table Tennis
Association; there are separate associations in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The 1997 World Table Tennis
Championships were held in Manchester.
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1873 and the first championships
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
governing body for tennis in Great Britain is
the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), to which
the Welsh and Scottish LTAs are affiliated.
Tennis in Northern Ireland is governed by
Tennis Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The Wimbledon Championships, held
within the grounds of the All England Club,
are one of the four tennis ‘Grand Slam’
tournaments. Prize money totalled £7.2
million in 1998. In 1997 the Championships
generated £31 million for British tennis.
The two leading British players—Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski—are both ranked
in the world’s top 20. Tim Henman reached
the semi-finals in the 1998 Wimbledon
Championships, his best performance in a
Grand Slam event, while Greg Rusedski was
runner-up in the 1997 US Open. In the 1996
Olympics Neil Broad and Tim Henman were
runners-up in the men’s doubles.
Players can take part in national and county
championships. National competitions are
organised for schools, and short tennis has
been introduced for children aged five and
over. The game is played in over 3,000 schools
and in leisure centres. About 5 million people
play tennis in the UK.
The LTA has a five-year plan for
developing tennis in Great Britain in the
period to 2001. The aim is to expand
participation, encourage regular competition
and produce more world-class tennis players.
In May 1998 it organised ‘Play Tennis 98’, an
initiative designed to encourage an additional
100,000 people to play tennis regularly, and
this was staged at 1,200 centres around the
country.
Volleyball
The English Volleyball Association and
parallel associations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland act as the sport’s governing
bodies. The Association organises competition
at national and international level, and
regional and area championships for a variety
310
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREA TION
of age groups. It also supervises the Beach
Volleyball Grand Prix and co-ordinates the
staging of outdoor tournaments on grass, for
both adults and children. Mini-Volley is a
three-a-side version of the game adapted for
children under 13, and is becoming more
popular in schools.
Yachting
Yachting comprises sailing, powerboating and
windsurfing on both inland and offshore
waters. Racing in sailing boats takes place
between one-design classes or under handicap,
which provides level racing for boats of
different size and shape.
The Royal Yachting Association is the
governing body for all yachting in the UK.
About 3 million people participate in the
sport. Among well-known yachting events in
the UK are Cowes Week (the world’s largest
and oldest sailing regatta) and the Fastnet
race, which is sailed every two years from
Cowes round the Fastnet Rock off the south¬
west coast of Ireland and back to Plymouth.
At the 1996 Olympics, silver medals were
won by Ben Ainslie in the Laser class and by
John Merricks and Ian Walker in the 470
(double-handed dinghy) class.

Indicators of Sustainable
Development 315
Sustainable development is a phrase that is becoming more widely known in
the UK, but is still not always fully understood. It is about ensuring a better
quality of life for everyone, both now and for generations to come. It means
looking at how we live and what we do in a much broader way, so that we take
account of the effects of our actions on the environment, the economy and
social progress—at one and the same time.
Introduction
The UK’s strategy on sustainable
development was first published in 1994, as
one of the documents that arose from the Rio
de Janeiro ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992 (the United
Nations Conference on Environment and
Development). The current Government is
reviewing the 1994 strategy to reflect changes
since then and its own distinctive approach to
sustainable development, which considers
environmental, economic and social factors in
a unified way. The new strategy, which is due
to be published in early 1999, will set out
policies which address sustainable
development in an integrated way and will
include indicators against which progress can
be judged.
An Action Plan for Scotland, to keep up
momentum on sustainable development under
the Scottish Parliament (see pp. 19-22), is to
be issued in autumn 1998.
In 1997, the former Departments of the
Environment and of Transport were merged
to form a new single Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR), in the belief that a ‘super-ministry’
of this kind would be able to tackle
environmental issues and sustainable
development in a more integrated way. In July
1998, the Government published its White
Paper on integrated transport, New Deal for
Transport—Better for Everyone, which, among
other things, puts forward proposals for
tackling the problems of congestion and
pollution (see chapter 22, pages 361-2).
Government and the Environment
The Government is committed to integrating
environmental considerations into policy- and
decision-making at all levels, and in every
sphere of its activity. Cabinet papers now have
to include details of significant costs or benefits
to the environment of new policy proposals.
‘Green Ministers’ from each of the major
departments meet on a regular basis, under
312
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
the chairmanship of the Minister for the
Environment, to share best practice and
encourage sustainable development right
across government, particularly by promoting
the environmental appraisal of policies,
programmes and projects. Individually, they
look after the sustainable development
dimension to their own department’s area of
responsibility, and make sure that it has an
effective appraisal system, and operates as
sustainably as possible in terms of energy
efficiency, waste minimisation, staff travel,
buying goods and services, and so on (the
Greening Government initiative).
Green Ministers also support the Cabinet
Committee on the Environment, which was
created in 1997 and considers environmental
policy issues at a strategic level. The
Committee is chaired by the Deputy Prime
Minister.
Also in 1997, the Environmental Audit
Select Committee of the House of Commons
met for the first time. This Committee’s remit
is to scrutinise how far the policies and
programmes of government departments and
non-departmental public bodies contribute to
environmental protection and sustainable
development; to audit their performance
against targets set for them by ministers; and
to report their findings to Parliament. The
Committee has already reported on the
Government’s Pre-Budget Report (see p. 388)
and on the Greening Government initiative.
Sustainable Development Units
Another piece of the jigsaw in the framework
for putting the environment at the heart of
UK policy-making is the establishment of
Sustainable Development Units. The Scottish
Office has had a Sustainable Development
Team since 1996, and a Unit was set up within
the DETR in mid-1997. The DETR’s Unit
works closely with the Northern Ireland,
Scottish and Welsh Offices, and its work
programme includes:
• the review of the UK’s sustainable
development strategy;
• the Greening Government initiative;
• freedom of access to information on the
environment;
• government promotion of Local Agenda
21 (see p. 314); and
• sponsorship of, and responding to, the
Government Panel on Sustainable
Development, the UK Round Table on
Sustainable Development and the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution
(see below).
The British Government Panel on Sustainable
Development is an independent body which
advises on issues of major strategic importance
to sustainable development, and meets
formally at least four times a year. In its
Fourth Annual Report, published in February
1998, it drew the Government’s attention to
various issues of environmental concern,
including the worsening impact of human
activities on marine biodiversity, and the
contribution that good architectural design
and the use of appropriate building materials
can make to sustainable living and working.
The UK Round Table on Sustainable
Development brings together representatives of
business and local government, academics and
others to discuss relevant issues, and makes
recommendations to government. Recent
topics include getting the best out of
indicators of sustainable development (see p.
315), sustainable agriculture, and integrating
biodiversity into environmental management
systems. In January 1998, the Round Table
published a report on Economic Regulation,
which looks at the role of economic regulation
of energy, water and transport in furthering
sustainable development.
The Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution is an independent body which
advises on pollution matters. The DETR
provided it with nearly ^0.8 million of
support in 1997-98. The Royal Commission
published its 20th report, on transport and the
environment, in 1997, and its most recent, on
environmental standards, in October 1998.
Other organisations set up to help
formulate policy in this area are the Secretary
of State for Scotland’s Advisory Group on
Sustainable Development, and Going for Green,
which seeks to persuade individuals and
groups to commit themselves to sustainable
development (in Scotland, this role is taken by
Forward Scotland).
313
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Taxes
‘Green taxes’ are one tool available to
government in its efforts to promote
environmental sustainability. The 1998
Budget (see pp. 393-4) introduced increases in
road-fuel duty designed to cut carbon
emissions by 1.7 million tonnes by 2010. The
reductions of up to £500 in Vehicle Excise
Duty for lorries and buses with clean exhausts,
as well as the proposed £50 reduction for the
cleanest and smallest cars, should help to cut
emissions of particulates from urban road
transport by over 20% by 2005. Fuel and
excise duties raised over £21 million in
revenue for the Exchequer in 1996-97, and
there is a growing acceptance that the money
raised by some green taxes could be
reallocated to ‘environmental’ expenditure,
such as the improvement of public transport
in order to entice people out of their cars.
Other Budget measures included the
increase in the landfill tax (for waste disposal)
from £7 to £10 a tonne from April 1999, in an
attempt to encourage recycling; and a
reduction in VAT on the installation of
energy-saving materials, so that more low-
income households can afford to insulate their
homes. The Government is also considering
introducing taxes or charges on aggregates
(sand, gravel and crushed rock produced by
the quarrying industry), water pollution and
pesticides; and householders in England and
Wales who recycle more of their rubbish may
end up paying less council tax under a
proposed strategy to improve waste
management.
Education and Training
In response to a recommendation in the
Government Panel on Sustainable
Development’s Third Annual Report, a new
Sustainable Development Education Panel
(for England) was appointed in February 1998
to consider the provision of education for
sustainable development in schools, further
and higher education, at work and at home.
The new Panel will identify gaps and
opportunities in this important educational
area, point out the priorities and establish
partnerships to take action. In addition, an
extra £500,000 for more projects in the
voluntary sector in England, involving
education on sustainable development, will be
made available through the Environmental
Action Fund from 1998—99. In Scotland,
education for sustainable development has
been led by a group of experts, associated with
the Advisory Group on Sustainable
Development, since mid-1995.
Organisations such as Going for Green,
which funds Eco Schools, and Friends of the
Earth have already played a part in bringing
environmental awareness into the National
Curriculum in England (see chapter 10). The
Environmental Education Council for Wales
has developed a Welsh educational strategy,
and launched the first phase of its
Environment Network Centres in summer
1998. The Scottish National Curriculum also
contains major elements relating to sustainable
development.
The Environment Task Force (ETF), one
of four options available to 18-24 year olds
under the New Deal for the Young
Unemployed (see p. 155), was launched in 12
Pathfinder Areas in January 1998 and
introduced nationally in April. The ETF aims
to improve long-term employment prospects
through a combination of high-quality work
experience and training. It consists of projects
which deliver benefits in line with the
Government’s sustainable development
policies and objectives.
Local Agenda 21
At the Rio de Janeiro ‘Earth Summit’ in 1992,
an ‘Agenda for the 21st Century’ was adopted
by the international community. It set out a
framework of objectives and activities for
environmental protection and the sustainable
development necessary for the 21st century.
Two-thirds of the actions in Agenda 21
require the active involvement of local
authorities, and Chapter 28 of the Agenda
encouraged local authorities to adopt a ‘Local
Agenda 21’ by 1996.
In June 1997, the Local Government
Management Board reported that 70% of UK
local authorities had made a commitment to
Local Agenda 21, and that about 55% were
putting strategies in place. The Government
314
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
wants all local authorities to have adopted
Local Agenda 21 strategies by the year 2000.
The aim of such strategies is to integrate
sustainability into all local authority policies
and activities, in such areas as: economic
development and employment; health action
plans; housing; energy conservation; local
transport; air quality management; recycling;
and local biodiversity action plans (over 100 of
which were in preparation by January 1998). If
successful, such strategies should result in:
• social progress which recognises the
needs of everyone;
• effective protection of the environment;
• prudent use of natural resources; and
• the maintenance of high and stable levels
of economic growth and employment.
Indicators of Sustainable Development
Introducing appropriate policies is one step in
promoting sustainable development;
measuring their success is more difficult. The
UK first published a provisional set of 118
indicators of sustainable development in 1996;
these are now being revised and expanded
following extensive consultation both within
and outside government. The new set will be
published with the new strategy in early 1999.
In addition, the Government has said that it
wants to develop a small number of ‘headline
indicators’ of sustainable development, which
will give a clear picture of the general well¬
being of the nation and be resonant for policy¬
makers and the general public alike.
For some time now, one of the most widely
used measures of the economic progress of the
nation—Gross Domestic Product (GDP; see
p. 382)—has been regarded as an inadequate
indicator of national well-being; nor does it
reflect overall sustainable development. Social
and environmental improvements are as
important as economic ones. The Government
has stated that it would like to see the regular
reporting in the media of headline indicators
of sustainable development, covering social
and environmental issues alongside such well-
established measures as GDP, inflation and
unemployment, so that they become equally
embedded in the national consciousness, and
inspire interest, support and action at every
level.
The Government recognises that whittling
down indicators to a shortlist of a dozen or so
runs the risk of distorting the decision-making
process. An indicator of hedgerow length in
the UK, for instance, might prompt farmers to
concentrate on planting new hedgerows at the
expense of other environmental priorities,
such as cutting down on pesticides and
chemical fertilisers. Nevertheless, it considers
that the right indicators can be found to give a
clear and balanced picture of the UK’s
environmental, social and economic progress.
Business and the Consumer
The Government has launched a number of
initiatives to help business improve its
environmental awareness and consumers to
make environmental choices about what they
buy and from whom. Furthermore, the old
clash between economic efficiency and the
environment is fast disappearing as the
business world realises that, increasingly,
higher environmental standards can improve
overall economic performance. In a
consultation paper on ‘Sustainable Business’
published in June 1998, the Government
outlined a range of issues for business to
address, and the responses to these will
contribute to the development of the UK’s
revised sustainable development strategy.
A recent survey by KPMG showed that 78
of the FTSE1 top 100 companies address
environmental issues in their annual reports;
and 30 publish a separate environmental
performance report. The Government would
like all UK businesses with over 250
employees to have a publicly declared
environmental policy and report to
stakeholders on progress. The best company
environmental reports now publish clear and
ambitious targets, endorsed by top
management, which are successfully
addressing the impacts of their business on the
environment.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
The Environmental Technology Best Practice
Programme, launched in 1994 and jointly
funded and managed by the DTI and DETR,
is an eight-year programme which promotes
the use of better environmental practices that
reduce business costs for industry and
commerce. It provides information and advice
on environmental technologies and techniques
by means of publications, events, and a
helpline (0800 585794).
The Queen’s Awards for Environmental
Achievement are presented in recognition of
products, technology or processes developed by
British industry which offer major
environmental benefits compared with the
existing competition. Awards are only granted
for products, technology or processes which
have achieved commercial success. In 1998, the
four environment Awards were conferred upon:
• Energy Technology & Control Ltd of
Lewes, East Sussex: for energy
conservation and the reduction of
harmful emissions to air from
combustion processes in industrial
boilers;
• Euro Chemical Control pic of Leeds,
West Yorkshire: for the Devex developer
recycling management system for the
film processing industries;
• Pilkington pic of St Helens, Merseyside:
for Pilkington 3R™ technology to reduce
emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in
glass melting furnaces; and
• Rolls-Royce pic, Aerospace of Derby: for
a low NOx aeroengine combustor.
Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment (ACBE)
ACBE is a committee of business leaders
appointed by the Government and serving in a
personal capacity. It gives advice to the
Government on environmental issues of
concern to business; provides a link with
international business initiatives on the
environment; and helps to mobilise the
business community through demonstrating
good environmental practice.
In June 1998, ACBE produced a report on
climate change, which suggested that 10
Dyfi Eco Parc in Machynlleth, Powys, is
the UK’s first environment-friendly
business park, with units designed to have
a low impact on the environment. The
units make full use of natural daylight,
insulation and draughtproofing, and have
been constructed using locally sourced
natural materials.
A leading British renewable energy
company, Dulas Ltd, which offers
environmental engineering solutions to its
customers, is located at Dyfi Eco Parc. It is
one of 200 companies to have been
awarded the Millennium Products
marque, which recognises pioneering
products and services developed by UK
businesses.
million tonnes of carbon could be prevented
from entering the atmosphere if energy-saving
measures were adopted across all business
sectors. The chemicals industry has already
entered into an energy efficiency agreement,
and the Government would like to see other
sectors follow that lead.
Standards on Environmental Management
In 1996, the International Organisation for
Standardisation (ISO) published ISO 14001,
which is largely based on the earlier,
pioneering British standard BS 7750. ISO
14001 allows organisations to evaluate how
their activities, products and services affect
the environment, and gives them a systematic
approach to improving their overall
environmental performance. Certification is
achieved only after an audit of the
organisation’s environmental management
system by an independent body, such as the
British Standards Institution (BSI).
Accreditation of certification bodies in the UK
is carried out by the United Kingdom
Accreditation Service (UKAS).
By March 1998, over 430 organisations in
the UK had ISO 14001 certification
(including The Scottish Office main building
in Edinburgh), more than anywhere else in
Europe. In the same month, two Scottish
316
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
NHS Hospital Trusts and another from
Northern Ireland became the first hospitals in
the world to gain the standard and, thereby,
international recognition for their
environmental management practices.
The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
(EMAS), developed by the European
Commission, is a voluntary scheme applicable
to industry only, although it has been
extended in the UK to local government as
well. In Britain, registrations to EMAS are
lodged with the Institute of Environmental
Assessment. The environmental management
system element of EMAS corresponds to ISO
14001. However, EMAS also requires a
published environmental statement, which
provides the public with independently
validated information on the organisation’s
environmental performance. By March 1998,
nearly 50 sites in the UK had registered under
the scheme.
Environmental Labelling
British consumers are increasingly making
environmental choices in the goods they buy
and, in order to do so, they often rely on the
information given in product labels. For this
reason, the Government is keen to prevent
businesses from making misleading ‘green
claims’ for their products and services. In
February 1998, it launched a voluntary Green
Claims Code which it intends to back up with
legislation at a later date. The Code has been
endorsed by the Confederation of British
Industry, the British Retail Consortium and
the Local Authority Co-ordinating Body on
Food and Trading Standards, and has been
distributed to businesses throughout the UK.
This initiative will be dovetailed with a new
international standard on environmental
labelling—ISO 14021—which is likely to be
adopted early in 1999.
The UK has played a leading role in
developing the voluntary EU ecolabelling
scheme, which aims to help consumers
identify those products which are less harmful
to the environment over their whole life-cycle,
from raw materials and manufacture to waste
disposal. However, despite the success of the
scheme in some product areas—such as
washing machines, kitchen towels and
paints—EU ecolabels have not developed
nearly as far or as fast as originally hoped,
partly because many EU member states have
their own, separate, ecolabelling schemes. The
Government has been consulting about new
approaches to labelling consumer products,
some of which will be taken forward in 1999.
Local Products for Local People
One way of helping sustainable development
locally is to reduce the distance that goods are
transported from producer to consumer. In
1997, the City of Bath introduced a monthly
Farmers’ Market where farmers, producers
and craftsmen within a 35-mile radius of the
city could bring in their goods and sell them
direct to the public—an ancient concept, but
one that has been markedly absent in the UK
in modern times. The Bath Farmer’s Market
has been such a success that the neighbouring
city of Bristol introduced its own twice-
monthly version in June 1998.
Most of the charcoal sold in the UK for
summer barbecues is made from wood chopped
down from threatened woodland regions in
Asia or South America. And yet British
woodland has the resources to meet the
country’s needs. Bioregional is one of several
companies which have pioneered the
production of English charcoal, and actively
promote the principle of local production for
local needs. Large retailers such as B&Q^and
BP petrol stations are now buying much of
their charcoal from firms like Bioregional, using
its ‘green origins’ as an additional attraction for
environmentally aware consumers.
Public Attitudes
In 1996-97, DETR commissioned the latest in
a series of surveys in England and Wales of
people’s attitudes to, and knowledge of,
environmental issues, and actions they
undertake to help the environment. The
survey showed that nearly nine out of ten
people are concerned about environmental and
pollution problems, but they generally remain
optimistic that much can be done to alleviate
them. Many people claim that they regularly
take environmentally friendly actions (for
example, about half recycle newspapers).
317
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
However, there is also considerable confusion
about what causes environmental problems
and some resistance to the idea of introducing
environmental measures that involve a direct
cost to individuals.
About one third of the people interviewed
claimed that they had heard of‘sustainable
development’, but only a small proportion could
describe it in terms of linking economic
development, environmental protection and
social progress. Even so, only one in eight
respondents believed that the economy should
be given greater attention than the environment.
Biodiversity
Another outcome of the 1992 ‘Earth Summit’
was the Convention on Biological Diversity,
which has now been ratified by 170 countries,
including the UK. Among its many
obligations, the Convention requires signatory
countries to develop national strategies for the
conservation and sustainable use of biological
diversity, and in particular to protect the
world’s growing number of endangered
species. In 1994, Biodiversity: The UK Action
Plan was published, in response to Article 6 of
the Convention. The UK was one of the first
countries to publish a strategy and action plan
for conserving biodiversity and to carry out
pioneering work in developing costed targets
for individual species and habitats. The
partnership involved in carrying this work
forward includes government departments
and agencies; local government; academic
institutions and scientific collections; and
farming, land management and voluntary
sector conservation organisations.
In 1995, the Biodiversity Steering Group
published a report which included, for the
first time, costed action plans for the
conservation of 116 species and 14 habitats,
and recommendations for programmes to
improve biological recording and monitoring,
and public awareness. A further 56 species
action plans were published in June 1998, and,
by the end of the year, a total of 400 species
and 38 habitat action plans are expected to
have been published. The targets and
programmes contained in the action plans will
form a basis for nature conservation in the UK
into the next century.
In May 1998, the UK Round Table on
Sustainable Development published a report,
with recommendations for action, on
Integrating Biodiversity into Environmental
Management Systems (for example, ISO 14001
and EMAS—see pp. 316-7). However, the
British response to the challenge of sustainable
biodiversity is by no means restricted to local
or national action. Since the 1992 ‘Earth
Summit’ the UK has committed over £185
million in support of a wide range of
biodiversity programmes in over 40
developing countries, including the
management of ecosystems, research, training
and education. It has also committed over
£130 million to the Global Environment
Facility, which supports the Convention on
Biological Diversity.

During 1998, the present and future state of the countryside, the right of access
to it, and the livelihoods of those who live and work there, were the subject of
wide-ranging and sometimes heated public debate. From April 1999, a new
agency to champion rural England and the English countryside will be created
through a merger of the Countryside Commission (see below) and part of the
work of the Rural Development Commission (see p. 356).
In December 1997, the international community agreed legally binding cuts
in global emissions of the six main greenhouse gases. Targets for individual
European countries, including the UK, were agreed in June 1998.
Conservation
The Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR) is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England. The
Department for Culture, Media and Sport
has responsibility for archaeology and the
conservation of the built heritage in England.
The Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland
Offices have broadly equivalent
responsibilities. These departments delegate
many of their conservation functions to the
agencies described below. In addition, local
authorities and many voluntary organisations
are actively involved in environmental
conservation and protection.
The Countryside and Wildlife
The Countryside Commission aims to make
sure that the English countryside is protected,
and can be used and enjoyed now and in the
future. The Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)
have similar remits for Wales and Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Environment and
Heritage Service protects and manages
landscapes, habitats and species. It also has an
environmental protection role similar to that
of the Environment Agency for England and
Wales and the Scottish Environment
Protection Agency (see p. 329).
English Nature, CCW and SNH are
responsible for providing advice to the

Government and public information on nature
conservation; for notifying land of special
interest for its wildlife, geological and natural
features; and for establishing National Nature
Reserves. These three agencies operate
through the Joint Nature Conservation
Committee (JNCC) to fulfil their
responsibilities for Great Britain as a whole
and for international conservation matters.
All of these agencies support and conduct
their own environmental research.
In March 1998, the Government
announced a £4.5 million survey of England,
called Countryside Survey 2000, which will
repeat and extend the surveys done over the
past 20 years and provide a benchmark against
which the success of environmental policies
can be measured. It will use both on-the-
ground and satellite observation to produce a
map and database showing land cover, field by
field, across the whole country. The
Environment and Heritage Service published
a Northern Ireland Countryside Survey in
1997, and will be carrying out further work in
parallel with Countryside Survey 2000.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas
The Countryside Commission and the CCW
can designate National Parks and Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs),
subject to confirmation by the Secretaries of
State for the Environment, Transport and the
Regions and for Wales respectively (see map at
the beginning of the book).
Ten National Parks have been established
in England and Wales. Their aims are to
conserve and enhance the natural beauty,
wildlife and cultural heritage they contain,
and to promote opportunities for the
understanding and enjoyment by the public of
the areas they cover. They are ‘national’ in the
sense that they are of special value to the
nation as a whole. However, most of the land
remains in private hands. Each Park is
administered by an independent National Park
Authority.
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads are also
administered by their own independent
authority and enjoy protection equivalent to
that of a National Park. Since 1994 the
planning policies that apply to the National
Parks have applied to the New Forest Heritage
Area in Hampshire as well. In June 1998, the
Countryside Commission recommended that
the New Forest should have tailor-made
legislation enacted to make it equivalent to a
National Park, to conserve its natural beauty,
promote recreation and sustain the traditional
grazing regime.
A total of 41 AONBs have been designated
in England and Wales. They comprise areas of
national landscape quality, but do not have the
extensive areas of open country suitable for
recreation that are found in National Parks. In
June 1998, the Countryside Commission
recommended that legislation should be
320
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
enacted to allow local authorities to set up
specially constituted statutory conservation
boards for AONBs, particularly for the South
Downs.
In Scotland, there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas, together
covering more than 11,000 sq km (4,300 sq
miles), where certain kinds of development are
subject to consultation with SNH and, in the
event of a disagreement, with the Secretary of
State for Scotland. In 1997, the Government
announced its support for the introduction of
National Parks in Scotland. The Cairngorms,
and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, two
areas of outstanding natural importance, are
candidates for National Park status. This will
require primary legislation, which will be a
matter for the Scottish Parliament (see p. 19).
In Northern Ireland, the Council for
Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the Government on the preservation of
amenities and the designation of Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty. In all, nine such
areas have been designated.
Forest and Country Parks
There are 17 forest parks in Great Britain,
covering nearly 3,000 sq km (1,150 sq miles),
which are administered by the Forestry
Commission (see pp. 465-7); and nine in
Northern Ireland, where they are
administered by the Forest Service of the
Department of Agriculture.
The Countryside Commission recognises
214 country parks and more than 250 picnic
sites in England. A further 36 country parks in
Wales are recognised by the CCW, and there
are also 36 country parks in Scotland.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
Unitary and county councils in England and
Wales (see p. 60) are responsible for keeping
public rights of way signposted and free from
obstruction. Public paths are usually
maintained by these ‘highway authorities’,
which also supervise landowners’ duties to
repair stiles and gates. In Scotland, planning
authorities are responsible for asserting and
protecting rights of way. Subject to public
consultation, local authorities in Great Britain
can create paths, close paths no longer needed
for public use, and divert paths to meet the
needs of either the public or landowners.
Farmers in England and Wales are required
by law to restore any public paths damaged or
erased by agricultural operations. England has
about 169,000 km (106,000 miles) of rights of
way and Wales about 40,000 km (24,000
miles).
There are 13 approved national trails open
in England, stretching about 3,000 km (nearly
2,000 miles), two in Wales covering about
510 km (320 miles), and three approved-long¬
distance routes in Scotland, covering about
550 km (345 miles). The Cotswold Way was
approved as a national trail in February 1998.
A new national trail following the route of
Hadrian’s Wall will be ready in 2001. In
Wales, Glyndwr’s Way (a roughly circular
route in Powys), and in Scotland a new Great
Glen Way, are at an advanced stage of
planning.
Horse-riding and cycling in the countryside
are encouraged, for both health and
environmental reasons. The National Cycle
Network, a nationwide construction project
for the Millennium, is being co-ordinated by
the charity Sustrans with the help of Lottery
funds (see p. 120). One of the aims of the
Network, which should have 8,000 miles
(12,800 km) of cycleway when completed,
is to popularise cycling as a viable alternative
to the car.
There is no automatic right of public access
to open country, although many landowners
allow it more or less freely. Local authorities
in England and Wales can secure access by
means of agreements with landowners. If
agreements cannot be reached, authorities may
acquire land or make orders for public access.
Similar powers cover Scotland and Northern
Ireland; in Northern Ireland, the primary
responsibility lies with district councils. In
Scotland, there is a tradition of freedom to
roam, based on tolerance between landowners
and those seeking reasonable recreational
access to the hills.
Common land totals more than 550,000
hectares (1.4 million acres) in England and
Wales. Only one fifth of common land has a
right of public access, although the open
character of commons has made them a
321
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
magnet for informal recreation. Four-fifths of
common land is privately owned, but people
other than the owner may have rights over it,
for example, as pasture land. Commons are
protected by law, and the Secretary of State’s
consent is usually required to undertake works
on them. There is no common land in
Scotland or Northern Ireland.
In February 1998, the Government
published a consultation paper on ‘Access
to the Open Countryside in England and
Wales’, containing proposals which,
among other things, would permanently
extend access for walkers to around 10%
of the total land area of England and Wales
(1.4 million hectares/3.5 million acres).
However, it will be necessary to establish a
proper balance between the rights and
responsibilities of those who benefit from
greater access, and of those affected by it,
such as landowners and farmers. Any new
right of access would extend only to open
countryside, and would not include
developed land or land used for agriculture
(other than rough grazing).
In Scotland, SNH has been asked to advise
ministers on the desirability of changes in the
law relating to access, with a view to
legislation by the Scottish Parliament in due
course (see chapter 4).
The Countryside Commission is hoping to
establish at least 250 new Millennium Greens
across England to mark the year 2000. By
August 1998, over 160 communities had been
offered grants to help them prepare their
plans, and more than 70 had begun to create
their Millennium Green.
The Coast
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The protection of the coastline
against erosion and flooding is administered
centrally by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office and The
Scottish Office. Operational responsibility lies
with local authorities and the Environment
Agency (see p. 329).
Certain stretches of undeveloped coast of
particular beauty in England and Wales are
defined as Heritage Coast. Jointly with local
authorities, the countryside agencies have
designated 45 Heritage Coasts, protecting
1,539 km (962 miles), about 35% of the total
length of coastline.
The National Trust (see p. 328), through
its Enterprise Neptune campaign, raises funds
to acquire and protect stretches of coastline of
great natural beauty and recreational value.
About £29 million has been raised since 1965
and the Trust now protects 920 km (575
miles) of coastline in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The National Trust for
Scotland also owns large parts of the Scottish
coastline and protects others through
conservation agreements.
English Nature offers funds for groups
setting up voluntary marine nature reserves and
producing or implementing management plans
for England’s estuaries. So far, 13 reserves have
been grant-aided and about 30 estuary
management plans produced, covering more
than 85% of England’s total estuarine area (the
Dee and Severn estuary plans were jointly
funded with CCW). There are also 29 informal
marine consultation areas in Scotland. In
addition, SNH has established the Focus on
Firths initiative to co-ordinate management of
the main Scottish estuaries. In Wales, the CCW
has been providing grant-in-aid for the past five
years to the Arfordir (or Coastal) Group, which
is concerned with the sustainable management
of the whole coast of Wales. Altogether there
are 163 estuaries in the UK, representing about
30% of the North Sea and Atlantic seaboard of
western Europe. The UK also has about 75%
of the European chalk coast.
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)
Over 6,000 SSSIs have been notified in Great
Britain for their plant, animal, geological or
physiographical features. Some are of
international importance and have been
designated for protection under the European
Commission (EC) Birds and Habitats
Directives or the Ramsar Convention on
Wetlands of International Importance.

c See p. 325.
CCW, English Nature and SNH have
powers to enter into land management
agreements with owners and occupiers of
SSSI land to safeguard the sites from
damaging operations, and to support the
management of their natural features. English
Nature has established the Wildlife
Enhancement Scheme, which gives financial
support to land managers for positive
management of land within SSSIs.
The Northern Ireland Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Government on nature conservation matters,
including the establishment and management of
land and marine nature reserves and the
declaration of Areas of Special Scientific Interest.
SSSIs are havens for wildlife and rare
species, and offer hope that plants, birds,
animals and insects can breed and prosper
on the sites themselves, and possibly
recolonise other parts of the countryside.
Figures from English Nature show that,
while there are relatively few cases of
deliberate damage to SSSIs, many sites
suffer from neglect or poor management.
The Government issued consultation papers
in autumn 1998 for England and Wales, and
for Scotland, on giving SSSIs greater
protection and more effective management.
Wildlife Protection
The principal legislation protecting wildlife in
Great Britain is the Wildlife and Countryside
Act 1981 (as amended). This extended the list
of protected species; restricted the
introduction into the countryside of animals
not normally found in the wild in Britain;
afforded greater protection for SSSIs than
previously; and made provision for Marine
Nature Reserves.
The list of protected species is reviewed by
the three statutory nature conservation
agencies, acting jointly through the JNCC,
every five years, when recommended changes
can be submitted to the Government (see
p. 2). In Northern Ireland separate legislation
on species and habitat protection is in line
with the rest of the UK.
The UK has about 96,000 separate species
(out of a global total of nearly 1.8 million).
Because agriculture dominates land use in the
UK, farming represents the greatest threat to
biodiversity while also being the sector that
can contribute most to its conservation. For
example, hedgerows, which are vitally
important corridors for wildlife on farmland,
have been declining at the rate of about 5% a
year, through removal and neglect. The
Hedgerow Regulations 1997 (for England and
Wales) came into effect in June 1998, and a
review group has since made
323
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
recommendations on ways of further
strengthening protection for hedgerows.
Some of the UK’s schemes which encourage
environmentally beneficial farming practices are
described in chapter 27 (pp. 457—9). A new,
separate, range of indicators is now being
developed to assess the impact of agriculture on
the environment and the rural economy.
Wildlife Trusts (based on conurbations,
counties or regions), the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Scottish
Wildlife Trust play an important part in
protecting wildlife throughout the UK, and
between them have established over 2,000
reserves. The Trusts are affiliated to a parent
organisation, ‘RSNC The Wildlife Trusts’.
The RSPB is the largest voluntary wildlife
conservation body in Europe.
The Partnership for Action Against
Wildlife Crime (PAW) includes
representatives of many statutory and
voluntary bodies involved in enforcing wildlife
controls. As well as providing a strategic
overview of wildlife law enforcement, the
PAW has published a practical guide for law
enforcement practitioners, and more specialist
publications, such as a Directory of Expertise
for use in wildlife forensic science. Wildlife
crime takes many forms: for example, theft of
eggs from birds of prey; illegal shooting,
trapping, poisoning, digging up of wild plants,
and the illegal trade in endangered species.
DNA testing is playing an increasing role in
combating crime of this kind, and there are
now specialist wildlife officers in almost every
police force in the country.
Species Recovery and Reintroduction
Extensive research and management are
carried out, principally by the three nature
conservation agencies, to encourage the
recovery of populations of species threatened
with extinction in the UK. Species recovery
programmes form part of the UK’s
Biodiversity Action Plan (see p. 318), which
includes individual Action Plans for a large
number of plants and animals in need of
conservation action, not least some which are
close to extinction. Species subject to Action
Plans include the greater mouse-eared bat,
skylark, great crested newt, twaite shad, black
bog ant, violet click beetle, speckled footman
moth, stalked puffball, river jelly lichen,
Lundy cabbage and Shetland pond weed.
Species: good news and bad
• The red kite, recently extinct in
England and Scotland, has been re¬
established in both countries, while
the Welsh population has recovered
from dangerously low levels;
• in the past 25 years, the population of
tree sparrows has declined by 95%,
and the grasshopper warbler by 91%;
• the once-threatened otter is returning
to many parts of the country, and has
been spotted in urban locations,
including the centre of Winchester;
• previously common birds, such as the
song thrush, bull finch, lapwing and
tawny owl, have declined by 50% or
more since the 1970s;
• blue whales have been sighted in
British waters for the first time in at
least 20 years, and a public
consultation has taken place about
whether to reintroduce the beaver to
selected areas of Scotland after an
absence of 400 years.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (see
p. 430) holds seeds from about 3,000 plant
species which are extinct or under severe threat
in the wild, and has been successful with
reintroduction projects. Its new Millennium
Seed Bank is planning to hold seeds of all seed¬
bearing plants in Britain by the year 2000, and
10% of flowering plants from the arid regions of
the world by 2010. The Royal Botanic Garden
in Edinburgh (see p. 430) promotes
conservation programmes for rare plants in
Scotland and for coniferous trees worldwide,
maintaining genetically diverse populations in
cultivation at many sites as pools for eventual
reintroduction to the wild.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree Preservation Orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands.

BIODIVERSITY ACTION PLANS
Biodiversity means the entire variety of life on Earth, from mammals to micro-organisms.
It includes species, genetic variations within species, the ecosystems within which species occur,
and the whole of the natural world from the commonplace to the highly endangered.
Shown here are some of the endangered British species for which Action Plans
have been drawn up — see also chapter 19.
(The photographs included in the 1998 Special Stamp Programme,
between pages 68 and 69, show some more of the endangered species that have Action Plans.)

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Once a tree is protected, it is in general an
offence to cut down or reshape it without
permission. Courts can impose substantial
fines for breaches of such orders. Where
protected trees are felled in contravention of
an order or are removed because they are
dying, dead or dangerous, replacement trees
must be planted. Local authorities have
powers to enforce this.
Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes, including the Forestry
Commission’s Woodland Grant Scheme, and
the planting of broadleaved trees has greatly
increased since the 1980s. Major afforestation
projects involving the DETR and the
Countryside Commission include the creation
of 12 community forests near major cities,
covering 450,000 hectares (1,112,000 acres).
The aim of these forests is to increase
woodland cover near the cities from 6.5% to
about 30%; restore areas scarred by industrial
dereliction; create sites for recreation, sport
and environmental education; and form new
habitats for wildlife. A separate National
Forest is taking shape in the English Midlands
(see p. 466).
The Woodland Trust is a voluntary body
which protects existing woods, and plants new
areas of woodland. It owns 922 woods across
the UK covering 16,000 hectares (40,000
acres) and, since it was founded in 1972, has
planted over 2 million trees. In Scotland, the
Central Scotland Woodland Trust is
promoting a major tree-planting and
environmental improvement scheme. In
Wales, Coed Cymru provides advice to
farmers and other woodland owners to
encourage the sustainable management of
broadleaf woodlands, many of which are on
farms. The development of a market for
Welsh hardwood timber is helping to
encourage appropriate management, and the
long-term survival, of these woods.
International Action
The UK’s international obligations to
conserve wildlife include membership of the
World Conservation Union; the Berne
Convention on the Conservation of European
Wildlife and Natural Habitats; the Bonn
Convention on the Conservation of Migratory
Species; and EC Directives on the
conservation of wild birds and of natural
habitats and wild fauna and flora. The
Habitats Directive includes the designation of
protected sites called Special Areas of
Conservation (SACs). Together with Special
Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under the
EC Wild Birds Directive, SACs will form a
European Union (EU) network of protected
sites known as Natura 2000.1 In February
1998, landowners were prevented from
continuing to damage the South Pennine SPA
by means of Great Britain’s first Special
Nature Conservation Order, made under the
Regulations that implement these EC
Directives.
The UK is also party to the Ramsar
Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance. The actions taken by the UK
since its ratification of the Convention on
Biological Diversity are described in chapter
19 (p. 318).
The UK is a party to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which
strictly regulates trade in endangered species
by means of a permit system. In 1997, the new
European Wildlife Trade Regulation came
into force, which bans or controls the trade in
more than 25,000 species of animals, birds and
plants. New national enforcement regulations
took effect at the same time, strengthening
police powers and increasing penalties for
offences.
The Darwin Initiative forms part of the
measures announced by the UK at the 1992
‘Earth Summit’ (see p. 312). It makes British
experience, expertise and financial support
available to developing countries with
important biological resources, to help them
with the conservation and sustainable use of
their species. A committee of experts advises
the Government on the Initiative, which
receives funding of £3 million a year. Over
170 projects have been funded so far, and the
latest round of 27 projects, announced in
March 1998, includes:
• support for the conservation and
sustainable use of reptiles in Togo;
1 One of the four marine SACs in Wales is Cardigan Bay,
which affords special protection to bottlenosed dolphins.

Buildings and Monuments
Lists of buildings of special architectural or
historic interest are compiled by the
Government, in England with the advice of
English Heritage. In Scotland and Wales,
buildings are listed by Historic Scotland and
Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments, executive
agencies of The Scottish and Welsh Offices. It
is against the law to demolish, extend or alter
the character of any ‘listed’ building without
prior consent from the local planning
authority or the appropriate Secretary of
State. The local planning authority can issue
‘building preservation notices’ to protect for
six months unlisted buildings that are at risk,
while the Government considers whether they
should be listed. The Northern Ireland Office
is advised by the Environment and Heritage
Service and the Historic Buildings Council in
its responsibility for the listing of buildings.
In England, English Heritage has
undertaken a three-year programme of
research into the main types of post-war
building. Buildings listed so far as a result of
the study include the Crystal Palace National
Sports Centre, the Royal College of Physicians
and Centre Point (all in London); the
Chichester Festival Theatre; and the first
Severn Bridge (in Wales, the Wye Viaduct
leading to this bridge has also been listed).
In England, details of each listed building
are contained in about 2,000 volumes (also
available on a computerised database) which
can be inspected at the offices of the Royal
Commission on the Historical Monuments of
England in Swindon and London. The lists
for individual local authorities are also held by
the local planning authorities, where they are
available for inspection, and at some public
libraries. A Register of Buildings at Risk,
launched by English Heritage in May 1998,
revealed that 4% of the most important
historic buildings in England are currently at
risk from neglect and decay.
English Heritage is responsible for the
maintenance, repair and presentation of 409
historic properties in public ownership. It
advises the Government on the listing of
buildings and the scheduling of monuments
(and on certain categories of application for
consent to alter or demolish them), and gives
grants for the repair of ancient monuments
and historic buildings in England (including
£5 million for 1998-99 under its new
Buildings at Risk initiative). Most of its
properties are open to the public, and there
were nearly 5.9 million visitors to its staffed
properties alone in 1997-98. Core government
funding for English Heritage is £102.1 million
in 1998-99.
In Scotland and Wales, Historic Scotland,
which cares for over 330 monuments, and
Cadw, with 130, perform similar functions.
There were 3 million visitors to Historic

Scotland properties in 1997-98. An Ancient
Monuments Board and an Historic
Buildings Council advise the Secretaries of
State. The Northern Ireland Office has 182
historic monuments in its care, managed by
the Environment and Heritage Service. It is
also advised by an Historic Monuments
Council.
Local planning authorities have designated
more than 9,000 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are 482 in Wales, 602 in Scotland, and
53 in Northern Ireland, designated by the
Northern Ireland Office. These areas receive
additional protection through the planning
system, particularly over the proposed
demolition of unlisted buildings.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
works of art and other items of outstanding
interest which are of importance to the
national heritage. The Fund is also used for
distributing the heritage share of the proceeds
from the National Lottery (see p. 120). By
July 1998, over £1,000 million had been
awarded from the Heritage Lottery Fund for
nearly 2,000 projects.
Ancient monuments are protected through
a system of scheduling. English Heritage is
engaged in a systematic assessment of all
known archaeological sites in England, in
order to identify which (out of some 600,000)
should be afforded statutory protection.
Similar efforts are being made to identify
buildings and ancient and historic monuments
eligible for statutory protection in Scotland
and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, where a
resurvey of historic buildings began in 1997.
In June 1998, English Heritage published its
Monuments at Risk Survey, which estimated
that about 16% of all recorded ancient
monuments have been destroyed since 1945,
mainly by development, road building and
agriculture.
Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport, and Historic
Scotland. Historic Royal Palaces and the
Royal Parks Agency carry out this function in
England.
Industrial, Transport and Maritime Heritage
As the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, the UK has a
rich industrial heritage, including such sites as
the Ironbridge Gorge, where Abraham Darby
(1677-1717) first smelted iron using coke
instead of charcoal. This has been inscribed as
a World Heritage Site (see below). Many other
museums devoted to the preservation of
industrial buildings and equipment have been
set up, such as the Newcastle Discovery
Museum and the Carrickfergus Gasworks
Museum.
Several industrial monuments are in the
care of the Secretary of State for Scotland,
including Bonawe Iron Furnace, the most
complete charcoal-fuelled ironworks surviving
in Britain; the working New Abbey Corn Mill;
and Dallas Dhu Malt Whisky Distillery.
The UK pioneered railways, and has a fine
heritage of railway buildings and structures. A
large number of disused railway lines have
been bought by railway preservation societies,
and several railway museums have been
established.
Reminders of the UK’s maritime past are
also preserved. Portsmouth is home to HMS
Victory (Admiral Nelson’s flagship), HMS
Warrior (the world’s first iron battleship), and
the remains of the Maty Rose, the world’s only
surviving 16th-century warship. The Imperial
War Museum has opened the cruiser HMS
Belfast to the public on the river Thames in
London. A voluntary body, the Maritime
Trust, preserves vessels and other maritime
items of historic or technical interest. The
Trust’s vessels include the clipper Cutty Sark
at Greenwich, in London. In all, about 400
historic ships are preserved in the UK, mostly
in private hands.
World Heritage Sites
The UK has 17 sites in the World Heritage
List, which was established under the World
Heritage Convention to identify and secure
lasting protection for sites of outstanding
universal value:
• Canterbury Cathedral, with
St Augustine’s Abbey and
St Martin’s Church, in Kent;

Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire;
the city of Bath, in north-east Somerset;
Hadrian’s Wall, the former Roman
frontier in northern England;
the Tower of London;
the Palace of Westminster, Westminster

• two natural sites in the UK’s Overseas
Territories (see pp. 74—5)—Gough Island
(part of Tristan da Cunha) in the South
Atlantic, and Henderson Island in the
South Pacific.
In October 1997, the Government
announced a review of sites in the UK which
might be nominated for World Heritage status
over the next ten years.
The Voluntary Sector
Voluntary organisations are well represented in
conservation work (over 2,000 are involved
with natural history and nature conservation
alone). Although they are funded largely by
subscription, private donations and entrance
fees, many receive government support and
grants, sometimes in recognition of statutory
responsibilities that they perform.
The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), a charity with about
2.5 million members, owns and protects well
over 300 properties open to the public, in
addition to 270,000 hectares (667,200 acres) of
land in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It
looks after historic houses and gardens, ancient
monuments and archaeological remains, forests,
woods, fens, farmland, downs, moorland, islands,
nature reserves and villages. The separate
National Trust for Scotland owns 116 properties
and 74,800 hectares (184,700 acres) of land.
The Civic Trust makes awards for
development and restoration work which
enhance surroundings. It undertakes urban
regeneration projects and acts as an umbrella
organisation for nearly 1,000 civic societies.
There are associate trusts in Scotland, Wales
and north-east England. Northern Ireland has
11 building preservation trusts.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Pollution Control
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. Central
government makes policy, promotes
legislation and advises pollution control
authorities on policy implementation. In
England, the Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions has
general responsibility for co-ordinating the
work of the Government on pollution control.
In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the
respective Secretaries of State exercise similar
responsibilities.
Local authorities also have important duties
and powers. They are responsible for:
• collection and disposal of domestic
wastes;
• keeping the streets clear of litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic
and, in England and Wales only, from
many industrial premises;
• review, assessment and management of
local air quality; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
The Environment Agency for England and
Wales and the Scottish Environment
Protection Agency (SEPA) regulate the major
pollution risks to air, water and land, and
waste. In Northern Ireland, the Environment
and Heritage Service exercises similar
functions.
There is an extensive framework of national
and EU legislation on the manufacture,
distribution, use and disposal of hazardous
chemicals. New and existing chemicals placed
on the market are subject to notification and
assessment procedures under EU legislation.
Chemicals such as pesticides, biocides and
veterinary medicines are subject to mandatory
approval procedures. A government
consultation paper published in July 1998 set
out options for improving the management of
chemicals in the environment.
An independent standing body, the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution,
advises the Government. It has produced 21
reports on a variety of topics, the two most
At a conference organised by the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe
in June 1998, environment ministers from
Europe and North America imposed strict
rules on emissions of lead, cadmium and
mercury, which can damage the nervous
system and disrupt foetal development.
They also set a schedule for phasing out 16
persistent organic pollutants (POPs),
including pesticides such as DDT and
industrial chemicals such as PCBs
(polychlorinated biphenyls). At a UN
Environment Programme meeting in
Montreal a week later, the world’s nations
began to negotiate a global clampdown on
POPs.
recent being on transport and the environment,
and on environmental standards.
Integrated Pollution Control
Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) is applied
to certain categories of industrial pollution.
The potentially most harmful processes are
subject to IPC and, in England and Wales,
require authorisation from the Environment
Agency. Emissions to air from more minor
processes are controlled in England and Wales
by local authorities under a parallel system of
local air pollution control (LAPC). In granting
authorisation for releases under IPC, the
Environment Agency requires the use of the
best available techniques, not entailing
excessive cost (BATNEEC), to prevent
polluting emissions or ensure that any releases
are made as harmless as possible.
In Scotland, IPC and LAPC are
administered by SEPA. In Northern Ireland
broadly similar controls are exercised by the
Environment and Heritage Service, and a
system of pollution control similar to IPC was
introduced in 1998.
A new EC Integrated Pollution and
Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive will
greatly extend the scope of IPC, both in the
number of installations and processes covered,
and in the range of environmental impacts that
will need to be considered before a permit is
329
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
issued. The UK is committed to implementing
the Directive by the end of 1999.
Land and waste
The projected need for 4.4 million new homes
between 1991 and 2016 could increase the
urbanised area of England from 11% to 12%
(see p. 345). The Government’s target that
60% of new houses should be built on
previously developed land (‘brownfield sites’)
has stressed the importance of recycling
land—some of which may be contaminated—
in order to relieve the pressure on the Green
Belts and the countryside more generally. The
DETR is co-ordinating the creation of a
National Land Use Database which will
provide a consistent assessment of vacant
previously developed land that may be
available for housing or other developments.
Contamination inhibits the recycling of
land and brings risks to human health and the
environment in any existing uses of that land.
Local authorities and the Environment
Agency have long-standing powers to deal
with problem sites, and the Government is
providing £15 million in 1998—99 to help meet
the costs of ‘remediating’ land (cleaning it up
so that it can be safely brought back into use).
In July 1999, new legislation will give local
authorities specific duties to identify
contaminated land and to require its
remediation. The Environment Agency will
have complementary regulatory, advisory and
information reporting roles. The Government
is providing £50 million from 1999 to 2002—
in addition to the £15 million annual
remediation programme—to support
implementation of this new regime.
Certain local authorities in England and
Wales are designated as waste collection
and/or waste disposal authorities, responsible
for different parts of the process of dealing
with wastes, including those that are subject to
specific controls. In Scotland, local authorities
carry out both these roles. Waste regulation
rests with the Environment Agency, SEPA
and, shortly, with the Environment and
Heritage Service in Northern Ireland. A
licensing system regulates sites for the
disposal, recovery and deposit of controlled
waste. ‘Special’—that is, hazardous—wastes
are subject to additional controls, specifically
related to their transport or movement.
Responsibility for proper handling of waste
falls on everyone who has control of it from
production to final disposal or recovery.
Operators of waste management facilities
remain responsible for them, even after
closure, until they are unlikely to pollute the
environment or harm human health.
The Basel Convention requires all
signatory countries to control transfrontier
shipments of hazardous wastes, and to ensure
they are managed in an environmentally sound
manner. The UK has been a party to the
Convention since 1994. The provisions of the
Basel Convention have now been transposed
into EC law, thus providing the means for
supervising and controlling shipments of
waste within, into and out of the EU.
In the 1998 Budget, the Government
increased the standard rate of landfill tax for
active wastes from £7 to £10 a tonne (from
April 1999), in order to strengthen the tax
incentive for waste minimisation and
recycling. However, this could encourage
more ‘fly tipping’ of waste, or otherwise
‘losing’ it, as an illegal way of avoiding the tax.
The environment agencies, local authorities,
police and the Tidy Britain Group (the
national agency for tackling litter) have been
closely monitoring the incidence of fly tipping
since the introduction of the tax. The
maximum penalty for fly tipping (and other
offences relating to waste) is six months’
imprisonment and/or a £20,000 fine.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The reclamation and recycling of waste
materials are encouraged whenever these are
the best practicable environmental option.
Local authorities are obliged to make plans for
the recycling of waste. The Government
recognises that substantial increases in
recycling and energy recovery from waste are
needed (see Table 20.5), and in June 1998
launched a consultation paper on a new Waste
Strategy for England and Wales. SEPA
published a draft Waste Strategy for
consultation at the end of 1997; and a draft
Waste Management Strategy for Northern
Ireland was published in July 1998.

a Includes composting.
b Primarily with energy recovery.
Under the EC Directive on packaging and
packaging waste (implemented in Great
Britain in 1997), at least 50% of the UK’s
packaging waste must be recovered and at
least 25% recycled by the year 2001. New
regulations that came into force in the UK in
May 1998 stipulate that all packaging must be
‘recoverable’ through at least one of the
following: recycling; incineration with energy
recovery; or composting or biodegradation.
The general public can deposit used glass
containers in bottle banks for recycling. There
are 16,731 bottle bank sites in the UK and
over 5,000 steel can banks. In 1996 there were
just over 9,000 can banks accepting aluminium
cans. A variety of other materials, such as
textiles, paper and plastics, are also recycled.
One of the Government’s waste targets is to
have easily accessible recycling facilities for
80% of households by 2000. Another is that
40% of homes with a garden should carry out
home composting by the end of the century.
maximum fine upon successful prosecution is
£2,500. The optional litter fixed penalty fine,
which discharges a person’s liability to
prosecution, was increased from £10 to £25
in 1997.
Local authorities have a duty to keep their
public land free of litter and refuse, including
dog faeces, as far as is practicable. Members of
the public have powers to take action against
authorities which fail to comply with their
responsibilities. Local authorities also have
powers to make it an offence not to clear up
after one’s dog in specified places, and may
also issue a fixed penalty fine of £25 under the
Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996. In Scotland
outdoor venues which host events that attract
large numbers of people are obliged to clear up
all litter within 12 hours.
In 1997-98, the DETR allocated £2.4
million to the Tidy Britain Group, which
provides a comprehensive anti-litter
programme in collaboration with local
authorities and the private sector.
Litter and Dog Fouling
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
331
Water
Research published in May 1998 by the
DETR showed that reducing coastal and river
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
pollution and ensuring a reliable water supply
were among the top environmental priorities
for the public.
All discharges to water in the UK require
the consent of the appropriate regulatory
authority. In England and Wales the
Environment Agency’s principal method of
controlling water pollution is through the
regulation of all effluent discharges, including
sewage, into groundwaters, and inland and
coastal waters. The Agency maintains public
registers containing information about water
quality, discharge consents, authorisations and
monitoring. Applicants for consents to
discharge have the right of appeal if they are
dissatisfied with the Agency’s decision; most
of these appeals are dealt with by the Planning
Inspectorate, an executive agency of the DETR.
In Scotland control is the responsibility of
SEPA, and most appeals are dealt with by The
Scottish Office. In Northern Ireland the
Environment and Heritage Service is
responsible for controlling water pollution.
In 1997, there were 4,717 cases in England
and Wales of discharges exceeding their
consented limits, including a number of
offences by water companies discharging
insufficiently treated sewage. The majority of
these breaches did not cause any significant
environmental damage. However, the
Environment Agency did bring 65 cases to
court, of which 61 were successful, resulting
in fines ranging from £440 to £12,000 and one
prison sentence of two months. In Scotland,
there were 2,734 pollution incidents in 1997;
SEPA seeks prosecution in all significant
cases.
In 1997 and 1998, the Government
introduced statutory Environmental Quality
Standards (EQSs) for 33 substances in water,
under the EC Dangerous Substances
Directive. The new regulations give legal force
for the first time to standards for some of the
most dangerous pollutants found in the
aquatic environment, including arsenic,
atrazine and simazine.
In the UK, 96% of the population live in
properties connected to a sewer, and sewage
treatment works serve over 80% of the
population. In England and Wales, the water
industry is committed to an investment
programme of some £11,000 million over ten
years for improvements to water quality.
Progressively higher treatment standards for
industrial waste effluents and new measures to
combat pollution from agriculture are
expected to bring further improvements in
water quality. In Scotland, responsibility for
the provision of all water and sewerage
services lies with three Water and Sewerage
Authorities, covering the north, east and west
of the country.
There are 68 designated Nitrate Vulnerable
Zones in England and Wales (and one in
Scotland), whose aim is to protect water
against pollution caused by nitrates used in
chemical fertilisers for agriculture. Another
environmental risk comes from chemicals used
in sheep-dips entering the aquatic
environment. Organophosphate dips pose a
potential health risk to those involved in
dipping, but the main alternative, synthetic
pyrethroid (SP) sheep-dips, are more toxic to
aquatic life. The Government has recently
revised its advice on the disposal of all used
dipwash, and the Environment Agency has
published a review of sheep dipping.
For details on the water supply industry
and the Drinking Water Inspectorate, see
pp. 506—8.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage Discharges
The quality of UK bathing waters fell slightly
during 1997, with 88% of waters meeting EC
mandatory coliform bacteria standards,
compared with 90% in 1996 (in 1988 only
66% met the standards). The water industry is
investing roughly £2,000 million to provide
treatment of coastal sewage discharges and
improve the quality of the UK’s bathing
waters. There are over 120 schemes to
improve sewage outfalls and overflow
arrangements, of which 100 were ready for the
1998 bathing season.
A record 45 beaches in the UK were
awarded Europe’s ‘Blue Flag’ in 1998. This
compares with 37 in Sweden and 299 in
France. Blue Flag awards recognise the
achievement of a number of objectives,
including beach cleanliness, dog control,
wheelchair access and the provision of life¬
saving equipment and other facilities.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Marine Environment
The United Nations declared 1998 the
International Year of the Ocean, to highlight
the threats that the seas face from human
activity. The main threats are:
• pollution from shipping;
• over-fishing (see pp. 462-5);
• discharges and emissions from land;
• dumping of waste;
• mineral exploitation of the sea bed;
• coastal development; and
• climate change (see pp. 336-8).
The OSPAR (Oslo-Paris) Convention of
1992 covered inputs and discharges of harmful
substances, from both land and sea, into the
North East Atlantic, set targets for reduction
and required parties to the Convention to take
all possible steps to prevent or eliminate
pollution. The first OSPAR Ministerial
Meeting in July 1998 reached agreement on
several issues, including:
• the end of the potential opt-out for
France and the UK on the dumping of
radioactive waste at sea;
• the adoption of a new Annex to the
OSPAR Convention concerning the
protection and conservation of
ecosystems and biological diversity of the
North East Atlantic, and a strategy to
implement the Annex;
• a total ban on the dumping at sea of all
large steel installations, and the removal
of their ‘footings’ (except in those cases
where the structure weighs more than
10,000 tonnes);
• the adoption of long-term strategies to
guide work on hazardous substances,
radioactive substances and
eutrophication;2 and
• approval for the production of a Quality
Status Report on the North East Atlantic
by 2000, to provide a sound scientific
basis for identifying and prioritising
future tasks.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (see
p. 372) is responsible for dealing with spillages
of oil or other hazardous substances from
ships at sea. The various counter-pollution
facilities for which it is responsible include:
remote-sensing surveillance aircraft; aerial and
seaborne spraying equipment; stocks of oil
dispersants; mechanical recovery and cargo
transfer equipment; and specialised beach
cleaning equipment.
A new protective zone around UK coasts,
in which virtually all oil pollution from ships
will be banned, has been designated by the
International Maritime Organisation and will
come into force in August 1999.
Decisions about which areas of the UK
Continental Shelf should be made available for
petroleum licensing take account of advice
from the Joint Nature Conservation
Committee (JNCC—see p. 320). Where areas
are made available for exploration and
development, special conditions may be
imposed on the licence holders to minimise or
avoid any impact on the marine environment.
These conditions are agreed with the JNCC.
Further protection was put in place in April
1998 with the introduction of regulations to
implement the EC Environmental Impact
Assessment Directive for offshore oil and gas
activities.
In May 1998, new rules to minimise
pollution damage from oil spills at sea came
into force, fulfilling the UK’s obligations
under the 1990 International Convention on
Oil Spill Preparedness, Response and Co¬
operation. Ports, harbours, oil-handling
facilities and offshore installations must
submit detailed oil spill contingency plans
before the end of 1999, and existing reporting
requirements are being expanded.
The UK does not permit any deposit of
waste in the sea where there is a safe land-
based alternative. Disposal at sea of most types
of waste, including industrial waste, has now
been phased out, and by the end of 1998
disposal of sewage sludge at sea will also have
ceased. From 1999, the only types of waste
that will routinely be considered for deposit in
the sea will be dredged material from ports
and harbours, and small quantities of fish
waste.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Air
Air quality in the UK has improved in the
past 30 years. The dense smoke-laden fogs, or
‘smogs’, that afflicted London and other major
cities in the 1950s and 1960s, have
disappeared, although parts of Northern
Ireland and some areas associated with coal
mining, where the use of domestic solid fuel is
widespread, still experience episodes of similar
poor air quality. Furthermore, new concerns
have arisen, especially over the emissions from
the growing number of motor vehicles, which
periodically produce ‘summertime smogs’,
consisting of ground-level ozone, airborne
particles and other pollutants. Measures have
consequently been adopted to reduce
emissions from road vehicles (see below).
Industrial processes with the greatest
potential for producing harmful emissions are
subject to IPC (see p. 329). Processes with a
significant but lesser potential for air pollution
require approval, in England and Wales from
local authorities, and in Scotland from SEPA.
Local authorities also control emissions of
black smoke from commercial and industrial
premises, and implement smoke control areas
to deal with emissions from domestic
properties. In Northern Ireland, regulations
introduced in October 1998 have made the
sale of unauthorised fuel in smoke control
areas illegal, and limited the sulphur content
of all domestic solid fuel.
The Environment Act 1995 placed new
duties on local authorities in Great Britain to
review and assess air quality and prepare
remedial action plans where appropriate.
Corresponding legislation will be prepared for
Northern Ireland. The Government has
provided local authorities with guidance in
line with national objectives, and with
financial assistance, to enable them to fulfil
their new responsibilities.
In 1997, the Government implemented the
National Air Quality Strategy, the first of its
kind in Europe, which sets out air quality
objectives for the pollutants of main concern:
nitrogen dioxide, airborne particles, ground-
level ozone, sulphur dioxide, carbon
monoxide, lead, benzene and 1,3 butadiene.
The target date for achieving the objectives is
2005. A review of the National Air Quality
Strategy will be completed by the end of 1998.
Above all, the Government is seeking a
scientific basis for further policy measures to
improve air quality.
During the UK Presidency of the EU, one
of the environmental agreements reached
was the Air Quality ‘Daughter Directive’.
This set legally binding limits from 2005
for four air pollutants: sulphur dioxide,
oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter
(airborne particles) and lead. The limits
are based on the advice of the World
Health Organisation, and should ensure a
higher standard of health protection for all.
The UK has an automatic air quality
monitoring network with sites covering much
of the country, in both urban and rural areas.
In recent years, this network has undergone a
rapid expansion, and it now has over 105 sites.
The increase has partly been achieved by
integrating local authority monitoring sites
into the national network. The Government
spends over £4 million each year on ambient
air quality monitoring.
Since 1990, daily Air Quality Bulletins have
made air pollution data from the monitoring
network available to the public. These give the
concentrations of the main pollutants,
together with an air pollution forecast. The
information features in television and radio
weather reports, and appears in many national
and local newspapers. Information, updated
hourly from the automatic monitoring sites, is
also available directly on an interactive free
telephone number (0800 556677), on videotext
systems and on the Internet. At the end of
1997, the Government revised the information
service to include airborne particles (PMio)
and carbon monoxide, in addition to sulphur
dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, benzene and
1,3 butadiene. The health-based bands have
also been changed (to ‘low, moderate, high or
very high’) to make them clearer.
Vehicle Emissions
Since 1993, legislation has required new
petrol-engined passenger cars to be fitted with
catalytic converters. These typically reduce
emissions by over 75%. There are already
334
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Air Pollutants: UK Emissions of Selected Gases from All Sources

Source: National Environmental Technology Centre
regulations for emissions such as carbon
dioxide, hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and
particulate matter. Three EC Directives
agreed during the UK Presidency, and which
will come into force from January 2000, will
further improve emissions from passenger cars
and light commercial vehicles. Their main
elements are:
• a further cut in emissions from petrol-
engined vehicles by 30%-40%, and from
diesel vehicles by 50%;
• the introduction of On Board Diagnostic
systems for petrol vehicles to ensure that
emission thresholds are not exceeded;
• the introduction of in-service testing of
vehicles;
• the reduction of sulphur levels in petrol
by 70%, and by 30% in diesel; and
• the reduction of benzene content in
petrol by 80%.
The European Commission has set further
standards for both car emissions and fuel
quality, to be introduced in 2005.
Compulsory tests of emissions from
vehicles in use are a key element in the UK’s
strategy for improving air quality. Britain has
introduced metered emission tests and smoke
checks into the annual ‘MoT’ roadworthiness
test (see p. 364). Enforcement checks carried
out at the roadside or in operators’ premises
also include at least a visual check for
excessive smoke. Wherever possible, a smoke
meter is used for borderline cases. The
Vehicle Inspectorate (see p. 364) carried out
125,000 roadside emissions checks in 1997-98
(on cars, coaches, lorries, buses and taxis) and
180,000 roadworthiness checks. In addition,
under a trial scheme introduced in 1997, seven
local authorities—Birmingham, Bristol,
Canterbury, Glasgow, Middlesbrough,
Swansea and Westminster—have been given
powers to enforce vehicle exhaust emissions
standards by random testing at the roadside.
Offenders who are causing avoidable pollution
are liable to pay a £60 fixed penalty.
Meanwhile, the Government has set up a
Cleaner Vehicles Task Force, whose overall
objective is to create a new partnership
335
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
between government and the private sector to
promote the development and marketing of
environmentally friendly vehicles that people
and business will actually want to buy and
drive. At the same time, the Government’s
Foresight Vehicle programme is promoting
R&D in cleaner vehicle technology.
Following a voluntary agreement signed
recently by the UK, car manufacturers are
working with component suppliers and the
dismantling industries to improve the
recyclability of new vehicles.
Sales of unleaded petrol have risen from
virtually nothing in the mid-1980s to over
75% of all petrol sold in 1998. At the end of
1997, about 80% of all petrol-engined cars
were capable of running on unleaded fuel. In
May 1998, the Government’s Expert Panel on
Air Quality Standards recommended that the
average level of lead in the air should be no
more than 0.25 micrograms per cubic metre
(pg/m3). In fact, urban levels of lead have
already reduced to 0.2 pg/m3 at most,
although the recommended standard is still
exceeded near some industrial sources of lead.
Since 1997, there has been a tax differential
of 1 penny per litre between ultra low sulphur
diesel and conventional diesel fuel. Around
300 retail sites now sell the ultra low
alternative, which accounts for about 3% of
the market.
The Government proposes to introduce
measures that will cut the levels of pollutants
emitted during refuelling of petrol vehicles at
petrol stations. These should substantially
reduce the emission of volatile organic
compounds contained in petrol vapour
(including benzene and 1,3 butadiene, both of
which can cause cancer). In addition, the
Government has set up an Airborne Particles
Expert Group to look at the physical and
chemical characteristics of particles and their
ability to disperse over long distances.
Vehicles are an important source of these
particles, and concentrations in many urban
areas will need to be reduced significantly if
air quality objectives are to be met.
Urban air quality will continue to benefit
not only from gradual improvements in
emissions standards for new vehicles, but also
from any reductions that can be achieved in
the total volume of traffic. Under the Road
Traffic Reduction Act 1997, local authorities
are required, by August 1999, to assess traffic
levels in their area, forecast their growth and
produce targets for reducing those levels, or at
least their rate of growth. A further Act passed
in 1998 requires the Secretary of State to set
national targets for road traffic reduction.
Other government measures to discourage
car use include green taxes (see p. 314), and a
trial scheme in Edinburgh, Leicester and
Bristol in which motorists are being charged
£6 to drive into city centres, in an attempt to
cut congestion. For a description of the
Government’s proposed integrated transport
policy, designed to encourage the wider use of
alternative forms of transport to road vehicles,
see chapter 22, pp. 361-2.
Climate Change
Several gases naturally present in the
atmosphere keep the Earth at a temperature
suitable for life by trapping energy from the
sun—the greenhouse effect. Emissions from
human activities are increasing the
atmospheric concentrations of several
important greenhouse gases, which in turn are
increasing the greenhouse effect and leading to
global warming. Easily the most significant
greenhouse gas in the UK is carbon dioxide
(CO2), followed by methane and nitrous oxide.
Some other greenhouse gases, such as
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), have high global
warming potential but comparatively low
levels of emission, although these are rising.
Between 1990 and 2100 the increase in
global surface temperatures is projected to be
about 2.5°C—a greater average rate of
warming than any seen in the last 10,000
years. The Hadley Centre for Climate
Prediction and Research (see p. 2) has just
completed a new climate change projection
which involves a more comprehensive
treatment of physical processes. The initial
results should be available in 1999.
It is also becoming increasingly important
to understand and predict the possible impacts
of climate change on the natural environment
and society, so that adaptation measures can
be planned. The Government has set up the
UK Climate Impacts Programme to allow
detailed regional assessments of the impacts to

be made. The Programme seeks to enlist the
support of all those who may need to make
plans for adaptation as a result of climate
change, and its first project will look at the
impacts on agriculture, water resources and
wildlife in East Anglia and the north west of
England.
International action on climate change
dates from the ‘Earth Summit’ in Rio in 1992
(see p. 312), where the Framework
Convention on Climate Change called for the
stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere at a level which would
prevent dangerous man-made interference
with the climate system. The UK is on course
to meet its Convention commitment to return
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the
year 2000. In fact, emissions of COz are
expected to be between 4% and 8% below
1990 levels; emissions of methane 22% below;
and emissions of nitrous oxide 62% below.
This achievement is the result of the UK’s
Climate Change Programme, published in
1994.
At the third Conference of the Parties to
the Framework Convention, held in Kyoto,
Japan, in December 1997, developed countries
agreed, for the first time, legally binding
targets to reduce emissions of the six main
greenhouse gases: CO2, methane, nitrous
oxide, HFCs, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and
sulphur hexafluoride. The Protocol
committed developed nations to a 5.2%
reduction in greenhouse gases below 1990
levels by 2008-12. The EU, with full UK
participation, played a leading role in securing
a satisfactory outcome, and agreed to a
reduction target of 8%.
In June 1998, the EU decided how its 8%
should be shared out among member states.
The individual country targets range from a
reduction of 28% for Luxembourg to an
increase of 27% for Portugal. The UK’s target
is a reduction of 12.5%, although it also has a
separate domestic goal of reducing CO2
emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by the
year 2010.
A consultation paper will be issued by the
end of 1998 on policy options for achieving
the UK’s legally binding Kyoto target and
moving beyond that to its 20% goal for CO2.
The new climate change programme is likely
to include measures to:
• improve energy efficiency by business
and in the home;
337
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
• reduce transport emissions; and
• increase the proportion of electricity
generated from renewable energy sources
and combined heat and power.
Stratospheric Ozone Layer
Stratospheric ozone forms a layer of gas about
10 km to 50 km (6 to 30 miles) above the
Earth’s surface, protecting it from the more
harmful effects of solar radiation. Ozone losses
over much of the globe, including a ‘hole’ in
the ozone layer over Antarctica, were first
discovered by British scientists in 1985. Ozone
depletion is caused by man-made chemicals
containing chlorine or bromine, such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or halons, which
have been used in aerosol sprays, refrigerators
and fire extinguishers.
The UK was one of the first 25 signatories
to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which deals
with the protection of the stratospheric ozone
layer. Over 160 countries have now signed the
Protocol. The Parties to it meet annually, with
major reviews every two to three years, and
controls on ozone-depleting substances have
been progressively tightened.
The Protocol required the phasing out of
the production of halons by 1993, and the
phasing out of CFCs, 1,1,1 trichloroethane
and carbon tetrachloride by the end of 1995 in
all developed countries. However, the EU has
introduced even tighter controls, including the
phasing out of CFC and carbon tetrachloride
production by the end of 1994, one year ahead
of the Protocol target. The UK has met its
requirements under the Montreal Protocol
and EC Regulations. Consumption of CFCs
was phased out in the UK and EU by the end
of 1994, although it is still allowed for a small
number of essential uses, such as asthma
inhalers.
The Protocol has also placed controls on
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which
are transitional substances with much lower
ozone-depleting potential than CFCs. They
are needed in a number of areas to allow
industry to stop using CFCs more quickly,
but are to be phased out by 2030 in developed
countries. The EU has introduced even
tighter controls on HCFCs, requiring their
consumption to be phased out by 2015, 15
years ahead of the Protocol. Production and
consumption of methyl bromide, a pesticide,
must be phased out by 2005 in developed
countries and 2015 in developing countries.
The Montreal Protocol imposes controls on
developing countries for CFCs as well, which
they are committed to phasing out by 2010. A
multilateral fund has been established to help
them comply with controls on ozone-depleting
substances; the UK contributes towards this.
Thanks to international action taken under
the Montreal Protocol, the ozone layer,
though continuing to suffer damage over the
next few years, is expected to begin recovering
within the next decade. However, the ozone is
not expected to return to pre-ozone-hole
levels until the middle of the next century.
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen
Sulphur dioxide (SOz) and oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) are the main gases whose emissions lead
to acid rain. The principal sources are
combustion plants that burn fossil fuels, such
as coal-fired power stations and, for NOx, road
vehicles. Under its National Plan for reducing
emissions from large combustion plants, the
UK had achieved, by 1996, a reduction from
1980 levels of 44% for NOx and 57% for SO2
(14% and 17% ahead of the 1998 target
respectively).
The damaging effect of high levels of acid
depositions from combustion processes on
freshwaters, trees, soils and buildings has been
demonstrated by scientific research. Lower
emissions of SO2 over the past 25 years (see
graph on p. 335) have led to the first signs of a
decrease in acidification in some lochs in
south-west Scotland. However, the Welsh
Acid Water Survey, published in 1997,
showed that, although emission controls are
benefiting the environment generally, the
recovery of more sensitive ecosystems has
been disappointingly slow.
Internationally, the UK is working with
both the UN and the EU to step up the fight
against acid rain. Britain’s ratification of the
Second Sulphur Protocol of the UN’s
Convention on Long Range Transboundary
Pollution commits it to an 80% reduction of
its 1980 sulphur emissions by 2010. The EU’s
338
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
new Acidification Strategy contains ambitious
measures aimed at reducing national emissions
of SO2, NOx and ammonia (another ‘acid rain’
gas). A Directive on the Sulphur Content of
Certain Liquid Fuels was agreed at the
European Council (see p. 67) in June 1998.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas periodically for ‘statutory nuisances’,
including noise nuisance from premises and
vehicles, machinery or equipment in the
street. They must also take reasonable steps to
investigate complaints, and serve a noise
abatement notice where the noise is judged to
be a statutory nuisance. They can also
designate noise abatement zones, within which
registered levels of noise from certain
premises may not be increased without their
permission.
There are specific provisions in law to
control noise from construction and
demolition sites; control the use of
loudspeakers in the streets; and enable
individuals to take independent action
through the courts against noise nuisance.
The Government promotes increased
public awareness of neighbour noise issues and
encourages the use of community mediation.
The Noise Act 1996, which came into force in
summer 1997, strengthens the law in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland on action that can
be taken against noisy neighbours. For
example, it clarifies the procedures under
which local authorities can confiscate noise¬
making equipment, and provides powers to
make night noise treatable as a separate
offence. In addition, the Housing Act 1996
gives them new powers to deal with anti-social
behaviour by tenants, which includes noise
nuisance. Complaints made to Environmental
Health Officers in local authorities in England
and Wales about noise from domestic
premises increased by almost five times
between 1983—84 and 1995—96 (and in
Scotland by around the same amount over a
similar period).
Compensation may be payable for loss in
property values caused by physical factors,
including noise from new or improved public
works such as roads, railways and airports.
Highway authorities are required to make
grants available for the insulation of homes
when they are subject to specified levels of
increased noise caused by new or improved
roads. Equivalent regulations exist for
railways. The issue of transport noise, and the
effort being made to reduce it, is addressed in
the Integrated Transport White Paper (see
p. 361). A £700,000 research programme
funded by the DETR and supported by
industry is specifically aimed at reducing the
noise generated by vehicle tyres in rolling over
the road surface.
The UK has played a leading role in
negotiations aimed at phasing out older,
noisier subsonic jet aircraft, the last of which
will be phased out by April 2002. Various
operational restrictions have been introduced
to reduce noise disturbance further at the
UK’s major airports, including Heathrow,
Gatwick and Stansted.
The population disturbed by aircraft noise3
at Heathrow airport fell from 591,000 in 1988
to 323,500 in 1995, even though the number of
air transport movements increased by almost
25%. The Government also has a control
system for night flights at the London
airports, combining a noise quota with a
ceiling on the total number of movements.
A £600,000 research programme for three
years from 1997-98, funded by the DETR
and the Department of Health, will be
investigating the non-auditory effects of
noise on health. The research will look at:
• the effects of noise on the cognitive
development and reading skills of
children;
• the possible relationship between
exposure to noise and the
cardiovascular system and psychiatric
disorders; and
• the relationship between noise and
sleep disturbance, especially at onset
and awakening.
3 That is, living within the 57 Leg noise contour, which is
officially regarded as the onset of disturbance.
339
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents only a small
fraction—about 15%—of what the population
is exposed to; most occurs naturally. A large
proportion of the exposure to man-made
radiation comes from medical uses, such as
X-rays. This and other man-made radiation is
subject to stringent control. Users of
radioactive materials must be registered by the
Environment Agency in England and Wales
and its equivalents in Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Authorisation is also required for the
accumulation and disposal of radioactive
waste.4 The Health and Safety Executive
(HSE—see p. 164) is responsible for
regulating safety at civil nuclear installations.
No such installation may be constructed or
operated without a licence granted by the
HSE.
In 1987 the Government first announced
measures to deal with the problem of radon, a
naturally occurring radioactive gas which can
accumulate in houses, and which accounts for
half of the total average population radiation
dose. All householders in England who live in
areas with a greater than 5% probability of
being above the radon Action Level have been
offered a free, government-funded survey by
the National Radiological Protection Board
(NRPB). Parts of Northern Ireland, Wales and
Scotland have also been identified where
above average numbers of houses are likely to
be affected by radon. Free tests have been
offered to households with the highest
probability of high radon levels. Simple and
relatively inexpensive remedies are available to
households at risk from radon concentrations.
New homes are protected from radon through
the requirements of the Building Regulations
in high radon areas.
Radioactive Waste Disposal
The disposal of radioactive waste is regulated
by law. Radioactive wastes vary widely in
nature and level of activity, and the methods
of disposal reflect this. Most solid low-level
4 Routine radioactive discharges are authorised by the
Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances
Act 1993.
The radioactive fallout from the nuclear
accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986
continues to affect parts of the UK. In
June 1998, 10 hill farms in Cumbria, 359
farms in Wales, 23 in Scotland and 45 in
Northern Ireland were still affected by
restrictions, under the Food and
Environment Protection Act, on the
movement, sale and slaughter of sheep.
The area affected, however, is steadily
decreasing.
waste (LEW), material of low radioactivity, is
disposed of at the shallow disposal facility at
Drigg in Cumbria. Some small quantities of
LEW are disposed of at authorised landfill
sites.
Intermediate-level waste is usually stored at
those sites where it is generated; most of the
UK’s inventory is at Sellafield in Cumbria.
The issue of disposing of nuclear waste safely
in the long term was highlighted by the
rejection of Nirex’s planning appeal to
construct an underground rock laboratory for
repository development work, and by the
decision to remove and treat 633.4 cubic
metres of waste dumped over 20 years ago in a
deep shaft at the Dounreay nuclear research
plant in Scotland.
High-level or heat-generating waste is
stored in either raw or vitrified (glasslike)
form. Once vitrified it will be stored for at
least 50 years to allow it to cool to a safe
temperature for disposal (for which the
Government is developing a research
strategy). In addition, the House of Lords
Select Committee on Science and Technology
has launched an inquiry into nuclear waste
management, which is expected to report in
autumn 1998.
Environmental Research
Research is essential to the formulation of
sound environmental policies. Several
government departments—such as the
DETR, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food, the Department of Health and The
Scottish Office—have substantial research
programmes. In 1997—98, the DETR
340
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
commissioned 120 separate contracts on
environmental research.
Among the most important non-
departmental public bodies that carry out
research in this area are the Meteorological
Office (including the Hadley Centre—see
p. 336), and the Environment Agency (see
p. 329), whose R&D budget for 1997-98 was
£12.3 million. The Natural Resources
Institute in Chatham, Kent has an important
role in environmental research, as do many
UK universities. The Climatic Research Unit
at the University of East Anglia is regarded by
many as the most important of its kind in the
world. Nearly 100 British universities and
colleges run courses on environmental studies
or natural resource management.
Most of the government-funded Research
Councils (see pp. 425-8) have a role in
environmental science research, but the
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) is particularly important. It had a
Science Budget allocation of £166.2 million in
1997-98, plus about £43 million from other
sources. NERC undertakes and supports
research and monitoring in the environmental
sciences (both life science and physical
science) and funds postgraduate training. Its
programmes encompass the marine, earth,
terrestrial, freshwater, polar and atmospheric
sciences, Earth observation, and science-based
archaeology. NERC’s interests range from
urban regeneration to international
collaborative work on global environmental
issues.
British zoos play an important part in the
conservation of endangered species and the
promotion of biodiversity through public
education, research and breeding
programmes.

As the United Kingdom is a relatively densely populated country, there are
considerable pressures on the use of land to accommodate the rising population
and the demands of a growing economy. The Government aims to create a fair
and efficient land use planning system that respects regional differences and
promotes development which is of high quality and sustainable.
The number of dwellings in the UK has risen by nearly half since 1961, to an
estimated total of 24.8 million in 1997. During this period the number of owner-
occupied dwellings increased by 130% to 16.7 million, while rented dwellings fell
by 16% to 8.1 million. Supporting home ownership and ensuring an adequate
provision of public and private rented housing are key government objectives.
Inner-city areas have suffered from the closure of long-established industries
and commerce, leaving problems of dereliction and unemployment.
Government policy seeks to address these problems, as part of a wider strategy
for reducing inequalities in British society, using a range of integrated local
regeneration programmes to stimulate economic development and social
cohesion in deprived urban and rural areas. A new network of nine Regional
Development Agencies will be set up in the English regions with considerable
local autonomy to boost regional economic and social renewal; London will have
a separate body.
PLANNING
Direct responsibility for land-use planning in
Great Britain lies with local authorities. The
Secretaries of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions, Wales and
Scotland have overall responsibility for the
operation of the system; in Wales and
Scotland the responsibility will be transferred
to the National Assembly for Wales and the
Scottish Parliament respectively in 1999. The
Department of the Environment, Transport
342
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
and the Regions (DETR) brings together the
major responsibilities for land-use planning,
housing and construction, countryside policy
and environmental protection, and transport in
England. The Welsh and Scottish Offices have
broadly equivalent responsibilities. In Northern
Ireland, the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland (DOENI), through the
Planning Service Agency, is in charge of
planning matters, liaising with the district
councils.
In England, the DETR provides national
planning policy guidance and has responsibility
for the issue of regional planning. National and
regional planning guidance provides the
framework within which statutory development
plans are prepared and adopted by local
authorities. Under new arrangements being
introduced, regional planning guidance will be
prepared by regional planning conferences of
local authorities in concert with Government
Offices (GOs) and other regional bodies, and
will be subject to public examination before
being issued by the Secretary of State. Regional
planning guidance will be shaped increasingly
from the regional level to reflect the greater
attention to policy development at this level
within the European Union. In Scotland, The
Scottish Office issues National Planning Policy
Guidelines and Planning Advice Notes, and the
Welsh Office issues Planning Guidance Notes
and Technical Advice Notes in Wales.
Strategic planning is the responsibility of the
county councils and unitary district authorities.
Most district councils are responsible for local
plans and development control. In London and
the metropolitan counties, and in some non¬
metropolitan unitary areas, districts prepare
unitary development plans and are responsible
for development control. In both Wales and
Scotland, planning responsibilities rest with the
unitary authorities (see p. 61).
The main priorities for planning are
decentralisation, creating a more integrated
approach to policy formulation, and improving
efficiency in the working of the planning
system.
Development Plans
Development plans have a central role in
shaping patterns of change in an area, as
planning decisions must be made in
accordance with the development plan unless
‘material considerations’ indicate otherwise.
The present system in England comprises
structure, local and unitary development
plans. Structure plans set out broad policies
for the development and use of land. They are
adopted by county councils and some unitary
councils (in those areas where unitary
authorities work jointly with neighbouring
authorities to maintain a joint scheme covering
their combined areas). Local plans are
prepared in general conformity with the
adopted structure plan, and provide detailed
guidance for development; these are adopted
by most district councils and National Park
authorities. Unitary development plans,
setting out both strategic and detailed land-
use and development policies, are adopted by
metropolitan districts, London boroughs and
some non-metropolitan unitary authorities.
In England and Wales, the preparation of a
district-wide development plan is mandatory.
In Wales, the unitary authorities are
responsible for plan preparation and are
drawing up unitary development plans for their
areas. They should have these plans in place by
the year 2000. In Scotland, where unitary
development plans are not a feature of the
system, the new unitary authorities have also
undertaken responsibility for plan preparation;
in some cases, structure plans will be taken
forward by a number of councils working
together. Under Northern Ireland’s single-tier
system, plans are prepared by the DOENI.
Members of the community are encouraged to
participate in the formulation of plan proposals
and policies; they can formally object and, in
the case of local and unitary development plans,
make their case in public to an independent
inspector (reporter in Scotland). The
Government has published proposals to speed
up the preparation and adoption of
development plans in England and Wales.
An important element of the Government’s
strategy for sustainable development (see
chapter 19) is for full use to be made of urban
land in existing towns and cities, while having
regard to the quality of the urban
environment, in order to avoid the need to
develop ‘greenfield’ sites and to reduce
transport demands.
343
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Green Belts
Green Belts, which have been a cornerstone of
the planning system for over 40 years, are
areas of land intended to be left open and
protected from inappropriate development.
The aims are to check the sprawl of large
built-up areas; safeguard surrounding
countryside from encroachment; prevent
neighbouring towns from merging; preserve
the special character of historic towns; and
assist in urban regeneration by encouraging
the re-use of derelict and other urban land.
Green Belts have been established around
major cities and conurbations, including
London, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the
West Midlands, as well as several smaller
towns. Some 1.5 million hectares (3.8 million
acres) are designated as Green Belt in England
and 155,000 hectares (380,000 acres) in
Scotland. The creation of Green Belts is
under consideration in Wales. The
Government attaches great importance to the
protection of Green Belts. Development
involving the loss of Green Belt land will
normally be allowed only in exceptional
circumstances.
Development Control
Most development requires specific planning
permission. Applications are dealt with on the
basis of development plans and other relevant
planning considerations, including national
and regional guidance. Currently, about
500,000 applications for planning permission
and other related consents are received by
local authorities in England each year, of
which some 88% are approved. In Scotland
some 40,000 applications are received, of
which about 90% are approved.
Applicants have a right of appeal to the
relevant Secretary of State in Great Britain if a
local authority refuses planning permission,
grants it with conditions attached, or fails to
decide an application within eight weeks1 (or
whatever longer period is agreed with the
applicant). Most appeals are decided on the
1 Two calendar months in Scotland.
basis of written submissions. However, either
party has the right to be heard by an inspector
(reporter in Scotland) at a public local inquiry
or at a hearing. A local inquiry is usually held
for more complicated or controversial
applications. Appeals in Northern Ireland are
determined by the Planning Appeals
Commission, which is also responsible for
holding public local inquiries.
The Secretaries of State can decide that a
planning application should be referred to
them for decision. They generally only use
this power to ‘call in’ proposals which raise
planning issues of national or regional
importance. In such circumstances, applicants
and local planning authorities have the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the
Secretary of State, and a public inquiry will
normally be held. Examples of major
proposals considered at public inquiry include
a fifth terminal at London’s Heathrow Airport
and a proposed superquarry at Lingarabay on
Harris (Outer Hebrides). In Northern Ireland,
major planning applications can be referred to
a public inquiry in certain circumstances.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Planning applications for certain types of
development must be accompanied by an
environmental statement. This should
describe the likely environmental effects and
measures to minimise any adverse ones.
Statements are available, for comment, to the
public and statutory bodies such as the
Countryside Commission, English Nature
and the Countryside Council for Wales (see
pp. 319-20). Planning authorities must
consider the environmental statement, and any
representations received on it, before granting
planning permission.
Architectural Standards
The Government emphasises the importance
of good design and architectural quality, both
in individual buildings and in the built
environment as a whole. While local planning
authorities are expected to reject designs
which are out of scale or character with their
surroundings, the Government’s view is that
344
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
they should not seek to control the detailed
composition of buildings unless the sensitive
character of their location justifies it, nor
should they seek arbitrarily to impose a
particular architectural taste or look. Guidance
on architectural competitions has been
updated by the DETR and the Department
for Culture, Media and Sport. The Royal Fine
Art Commissions for England and Scotland
advise government departments, local
planning authorities and other public bodies
on questions of quality, public amenity and
artistic importance.
The Architects Registration Board,
together with the architects’ professional
bodies—the Royal Institute of British
Architects, the Royal Incorporation of
Architects in Scotland and the Royal Society
of Ulster Architects—exercises control over
standards in architectural training and
encourages high standards in the profession.
The Royal Town Planning Institute carries
out similar functions for the planning
profession.
HOUSING
The Government’s housing objective is to
offer everyone the opportunity of a decent
home and so promote social cohesion, well¬
being and self-dependence. The Secretary of
State for the Environment, Transport and the
Regions in England and the Secretaries of
State for Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland are responsible for formulating
housing policy and supervising the housing
programme. In Great Britain, they work
closely with local authorities, which are
responsible for preparing local housing
strategies, have important statutory duties,
and own a number of homes. In Wales and
Scotland responsibility for housing will come
under the new National Assembly for Wales
and the Scottish Parliament respectively from
mid-1999. The Government also works in
partnership with regional and public bodies,
such as the Housing Corporation, which
regulates social landlords in England and
provides financial support, and with the
private and voluntary sectors. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive, which is a public
body, is the sole housing authority in
Northern Ireland; it assesses all social housing
requirements and manages its own stock of
homes.
Housing Stock
There are around 20.5 million dwellings in
England, 2.2 million in Scotland, 1.2 million
in Wales and 618,000 in Northern Ireland. In
1997, about 178,200 new dwellings were
completed in Great Britain. Around four-
fifths of new dwellings are constructed by the
private sector for sale to owner-occupiers.
Owner-occupied homes represent about two-
thirds of all dwellings and rented homes a
third.
The number of dwellings is expected to
rise, reflecting changing lifestyles, as more
people live on their own. In England there
is a projected need for 4.4 million new
households between 1991 and 2016. The
Government has considered the
implications, in line with its commitments
to the protection of the countryside and
the regeneration of urban areas. In
February 1998 it announced that it
favoured the development of regional
targets for building new homes on
previously developed sites, especially those
in urban areas, and proposed measures,
including:
• a rise in the proportion of new houses
to be built on previously developed
land, from 50% to 60% over the next
ten years;
• the establishment of a new national
database of land use, to help identify
previously developed sites; and
• a task force to help local authorities
make better use of such sites.
Home Ownership
The number of owner-occupied dwellings in
Great Britain amounted to 16.1 million at the
end of 1996. In England, owner occupation is
highest in the South East, where 74% of
dwellings were owner-occupied in 1996,
followed by the South West (72%). Scotland

has traditionally had one of the lowest levels of
owner-occupation in the UK. However, home
ownership in Scotland has been increasing,
and 59% of dwellings were owner-occupied in
1996, so that the lowest level is now in
London (57%).
Legislation on the ‘right to buy’ (see p. 347)
passed in the 1980s significantly increased
home ownership among former public sector
tenants. Sales by local authorities and New
Town development corporations to tenants
under the right-to-buy laws in Great Britain
peaked in 1982 at over 200,000. Following a fall
in sales, there was a further peak in 1989 when
more than 190,000 homes were sold to public
sector tenants. By the end of 1997, approaching
2 million council, housing association and New
Town development corporation houses had
been sold into owner-occupation in Great
Britain under this legislation. Sales are
continuing at a rate of about 50,000 a year.
Mortgage Loans
A feature of the pattern of home ownership in
the UK is the relatively high proportion of
homes owned with a mortgage—around 42%
of dwellings, compared with an EU average of
24%. Most people in the UK buy their homes
with a mortgage loan, using the property as
security. These are obtained through banks,
building societies or other financial
institutions such as specialist mortgage
lenders. Some companies grant low-interest
loans for house purchase to their employees.
There are two main types of mortgage:
• a repayment mortgage, where the
borrower’s monthly payment covers the
interest repayment and a contribution
towards repaying the capital, so that the
loan will be paid off at the end of the
mortgage period; and
346
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Average House Prices, 1985-97
£000
Source: Housing and Construction Statistics
• an interest-only mortgage, under which
the payment covers the interest charge
and a contribution towards a fund which
builds up with the aim of achieving a
lump sum sufficient to repay the loan in
full at the end of the mortgage period.
Most funds are endowments, linked to an
insurance policy, but a growing number
of funds go into other investments, such
as a PEP (Personal Equity Plan, see
p. 521) or a personal pension.
In the fourth quarter of 1997 interest-only
mortgages accounted for 60% of new
mortgages taken out in the UK and repayment
mortgages for 39%, according to the Council
of Mortgage Lenders.
The amount that lenders are prepared to
advance to a potential house purchaser is
generally calculated as a multiple of his or her
annual income, typically up to two-and-a-half
or three times earnings, and the term of the
loan is approximately 25 years. Owner-
occupiers can claim tax relief on interest
payments on the first £30,000 of their
mortgages on their main home (see p. 395).
The Council of Mortgage Lenders
introduced a voluntary Mortgage Code in
1997 for mortgage lenders and extended it to
over 43,000 mortgage intermediaries in April
1998, so that it now covers virtually the entire
mortgage market. The Code is designed to set
benchmark standards of good mortgage
lending practice. The Government is
encouraging the mortgage lending industry to
develop flexible mortgages which allow
borrowers to vary their payments according to
their circumstances, so that, for example, they
can reduce or suspend payments during
periods of financial pressure. This
arrangement can be particularly helpful to
self-employed people and others with
fluctuating incomes.
Right to Buy and Low-cost Ownership
With a few exceptions, public tenants across
the UK with secure tenancies (see p. 350) of at

least two years’ standing are entitled to buy
their house or flat at a discount dependent
upon the length of their tenancy.
Other schemes which aim to increase low-
cost home ownership include shared
ownership schemes2 and discounted sales of
empty properties owned by local authorities.
In addition, some local authorities in England
operate Cash Incentive Schemes, under which
tenants are given cash help to buy in the
private sector. Some 5,000 local authority
tenants a year are receiving this assistance,
thereby opening up new lettings for those in
greatest need.
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home
ownership scheme which allows purchasers to
buy a home for 70% of its value, the balance
being secured as a charge on the property.
Scottish Homes (see p. 350) operates a scheme
to encourage private developers to build for
owner-occupation in areas they would not

normally consider; in 1998—99 £19.4 million
will be devoted to the scheme. A shared
ownership scheme in Northern Ireland is
administered by the Northern Ireland Co-
ownership Housing Association.
Rented Sector
Around a fifth of all homes are rented to
tenants by the public sector and non-profit-
making bodies, and are referred to as social
rented housing. The highest level is in
Scotland (30% of dwellings in 1996).
Together with the Irish Republic and the
Netherlands, the UK has one of the smallest
privately rented sectors in the European
Union, at about 10% of all dwellings. London
has the highest level of private renting in the
UK—15% of dwellings in 1996.
Privately Rented Housing
The Government wants to see a healthy
private rented sector. Assured and assured-
shorthold tenancies enable landlords to charge
348
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
a reasonable market rent and recover
possession of their property when they need
to. Assured and short assured tenancies in
Scotland are broadly similar. The Housing
Act 1996 introduced measures to encourage
small landlords in England and Wales to let
property, by reducing paperwork for letting
on an assured shorthold tenancy and by
speeding up action on rent arrears. A ‘Rent a
Room’ scheme enables homeowners to let
rooms to lodgers without having to pay tax on
rents up to a level of about £80 a week.
In Northern Ireland the private rented
sector accounts for almost 4% of total housing
stock; only a third of this is subject to
statutory control on rents. Rent levels for
controlled properties are linked to those of the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
Shorthold tenancies and assured tenancies are
available.
Greater protection is planned for tenants of
private rented houses in multiple occupation
(HMOs) through a mandatory licensing system.
The worst housing conditions are often found
in this sector of the market. The opportunity is
also being taken to review existing controls
which are specific to this sector.
Social Housing
The Government supports partnership
between the public sector, registered social
landlords (RSLs), such as housing
associations, and the private sector as
providers of good quality social housing—
housing provided at rents affordable to people
on low incomes, usually substantially below
market rents and with rent rises tending to be
in line with inflation.
Public Housing
Most social housing in Great Britain is
provided by local housing authorities—the
structure of local authorities in England, Wales
and Scotland is outlined on pp. 59-61. Public
housing is also provided by Scottish Homes,
which currently has a stock of about 19,000
houses. It is, however, in the process of
transferring its houses to alternative landlords,
such as housing associations. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive is responsible for
the supply and management of public housing
in Northern Ireland, and has almost 140,000
homes.
Public housing authorities in England own
about 3.4 million houses and flats. Around 60
local authorities have transferred all or part of
their stock to RSLs, involving the transfer of
250,000 properties by the end of 1997, which
has raised over £4,000 million in private
finance.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
modernising their housing stock from central
government grants, their own resources and
from loans from the Public Works Loan Board
(an independent statutory body) and private
sector financial organisations. They must keep
housing revenue accounts separate from other
council funds. The Government grants English
and Welsh local authorities Housing Revenue
Account Subsidy, worth around £3,519 million
in England and £164 million in Wales in
1998-99. In Scotland, Housing Support Grant
of about £12.7 million is available in 1998-99
for those authorities which are in deficit on
their housing revenue accounts.
Local authorities in England have been
allocated over £1,300 million in 1998-99 to
help meet housing and housing-related
regeneration needs through the Housing
Investment Programme (£769 million) and
the Capital Receipts Initiative (£610 million).
This initiative is providing additional
resources for refurbishing homes and
providing new homes according to local
priorities. Local authorities in Wales and
Scotland are receiving net capital allocations
(including the Capital Receipts Initiative) for
1998-99 amounting to £75 million and £218
million respectively for investment in council
homes. The Northern Ireland Housing
Executive’s capital programme is financed
mainly by borrowing from government and
receipts from house sales; in 1998-99
borrowing will total £25 million. Revenue
expenditure is funded from rental income and
by a government grant, which in 1998-99 is
about £150 million.
Registered Social Landlords
RSLs, which are non-profit-making, are the
main suppliers of new low-cost housing for
349
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
rent and for sale to those on low incomes and
in the greatest housing need. Some provide
supported housing to meet the special needs of
those with, for example, learning difficulties
(mental handicap), drug and alcohol problems,
young people at risk and frail elderly people.
RSLs own, manage and maintain 1 million
homes in England, including 165,000 units of
sheltered accommodation (see below) and
32,000 of supported housing.
In Great Britain new housing schemes
carried out by housing associations and other
RSLs may qualify for Social Housing Grant if
the social landlord concerned is one of about
2,200 registered with the Housing
Corporation (in England), Scottish Homes or,
in Wales, Tai Cymru (which will become part
of the Welsh Office by January 1999). These
three statutory organisations regulate and pay
grant to RSLs in their respective parts of
Great Britain. Broadly similar assistance is
available to RSLs in Northern Ireland. The
Housing Corporation’s programme has
provision for around £600 million in grants in
1998-99. Housing Corporation funding will
make possible an additional 36,000 lettings for
rent or shared ownership in 1998-99.
For 1998-99, expenditure on Scottish
Homes’ development funding programme,
which includes grants to private developers and
landlords, is £194 million, while the target for
the amount of private finance attracted is £160
million. Tai Cymru is currently managing a net
capital programme of £63 million in 1998—99,
with a target of starting 2,300 new homes.
Government provision to the housing
association movement in Wales was £370
million between 1994—95 and 1997—98. Private
sector finance generated over the same period
reached £274 million.
Northern Ireland’s registered housing
associations are expected to start 2,100 units of
accommodation in 1998-99. They now have a
stock of about 18,500 units for rent. The
budget for building for rent is £56 million in
1998—99, with an additional £25 million of
private finance.
Tenants’ Rights
Local authority tenants in England, Scotland
and Wales have security of tenure (that is,
they cannot under normal conditions be
forced to give up their homes so long as they
comply with local authority regulations) and
other statutory rights, which are set out in the
Council Tenant’s Charter. In addition to the
right to buy (see p. 347), these include the
right to have certain urgent repairs done
quickly at no cost to themselves and the right
to be reimbursed for any improvements which
they have financed should they move home.
Tenants must be kept closely involved in the
process of letting tenders to manage council
estates. They also have the right to take over
the running of their estates through tenant
management organisations (TMOs). Some
150 TMOs are operational and about 100
more are in the process of development.
The rights of RSL tenants in England are
set out in the Housing Corporation’s
regulatory standards, and are explained in a
series of residents’ charters. The rights cover
equal opportunities, occupancy agreements,
information, consultation, participation and
influence, complaints, and redress. Similar
arrangements exist elsewhere in the UK—in
Wales and Northern Ireland the rights of
housing association tenants are protected
through a Tenants’ Guarantee, issued
respectively by Tai Cymru and the DOENI.
Housing for Older People
Sheltered housing provides specialised
facilities for elderly people, such as common
and laundry rooms, alarm systems and
resident or non-resident warden support.
Increasing emphasis is being placed on
schemes to help the elderly continue to live in
their own homes by, for example, adapting
their present homes to meet particular needs.
In England, government-funded home
improvement agencies assist elderly people,
people with disabilities and those on low
incomes to carry out repairs and
improvements to their properties. Some £5.2
million of government assistance will go to
support 163 home improvement agencies in
1998-99. Care and Repair Ltd is the national
co-ordinating and monitoring body. Parallel
arrangements apply in Wales, where £976,000
of government funding will be available to 24
home improvement agencies in 1998-99.
350
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Corresponding provision is made for Scotland
under the Care and Repair scheme co¬
ordinated by Scottish Homes.
Rural Housing
Where there is a clear need for low-cost
housing in rural areas, local authorities can
permit housing in localities where
development would not normally be allowed,
so long as the new housing can be reserved to
meet that need. The Housing Corporation also
finances a special rural programme to build
houses in villages with a population of 3,000 or
below; between 1989-90 and 1998-99 it
approved funding for the building of 15,000
such homes.
Tai Cymru has a major role in rural
housing provision, with about a quarter of its
programme devoted to rural areas. The Welsh
Office also supports low-cost schemes for
rural housing. In Scotland, considerable
progress is being made through a range of
initiatives as part of the Scottish Homes Rural
Strategy. Scottish Homes invested £453
million in countryside areas between 1989-90
and 1997-98, providing 14,000 homes. In
1998-99 it will spend £37 million in rural
areas, making 850 homes available. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive operates
a rural strategy, involving action both in social
housing (new building and improvements)
and, through the house renovation grant
scheme, in private housing.
Improving Existing Housing
In urban areas of the UK, slum clearance and
large-scale redevelopment used to be major
features of housing policy, but there has been
a trend in recent years towards the
modernisation and conversion of sub-standard
homes in order to help maintain existing
communities. Housing conditions have
improved considerably, but problems remain
in some areas where there are concentrations
of dwellings requiring substantial repairs. In
some cases, however, clearance may still be the
most satisfactory course of action. To help
overcome objections to clearance, local
authorities can pay a discretionary relocation
grant to those displaced by clearance to enable
them to buy at least a part share in a new
home in the same area.
The English House Condition Survey
1996, published in May 1998, found that
the majority of people in England were
well housed and satisfied with their living
conditions. However, 7.5% of housing
stock was classified as unfit—with, for
example, unsatisfactory facilities for
preparation and cooking of food, disrepair
and dampness—a similar proportion to
that found in the previous survey in 1991.
The findings will help to shape future
government housing priorities and
contribute to the work of the Social
Exclusion Unit (see p. 115) in developing
approaches to the problems of the most
deprived neighbourhoods.
Social Housing
Rundown estates are being improved through
the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge
Fund (see p. 354), which encourages local
partnerships in England to tackle social and
economic problems, including housing
improvements. A £248 million Estate Renewal
Challenge Fund (ERCF) is being made
available to help renovate poor-quality estates
by speeding their transfer to housing
associations and other new landlords. In all, 15
local authorities are receiving finance under
the ERCF third round to improve the
condition of 22,000 homes on 58 estates.
Under the first two rounds of the ERCF,
£289 million was awarded to 20 local
authorities for 31 schemes covering 39,000
homes on 62 estates.
There are also six Housing Action Trusts
(HATs) which, with the agreement of their
tenants, have assumed responsibility for
regenerating severely rundown housing estates
in north Hull, Liverpool, Birmingham (Castle
Vale estate) and the London boroughs of
Waltham Forest, Tower Hamlets and Brent
(Stonebridge estate). They manage roughly
17,000 existing properties, and have ten-year
programmes in which to complete their work.
In Wales, Estate Partnership funding is
used to combat the problem of rundown local
351
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
authority estates; £10.6 million of central
government support has been allocated for
this purpose in 1998-99, to supplement local
authority and private sector contributions.
The Government’s policy on urban
regeneration in Scotland is also based on the
partnership approach (see p. 357).
Private Housing
made regulations to ensure that people
assisted under the homelessness legislation
will receive reasonable preference in the
allocation of social tenancies from the local
authority housing register. In Scotland, a new
code of guidance on homelessness was issued
in 1997. Northern Ireland policy on
homelessness broadly follows that in England
and Wales and is reviewed taking account of
any changes to policies or legislation there.
The Government offers assistance through
house renovation grants to owners of private
housing who are on low incomes and unable to
afford necessary repairs and improvements.
Specific help is available to disabled people
needing adaptations to their homes. Grants
may provide up to 100% support for essential
repairs and improvements to the poorest
homeowners. In all, between 1990—91 and
1996-97 almost 700,000 grants were made in
England, totalling nearly £2,800 million in
public expenditure. In Wales 113,000 grants
were made between April 1991 and March
1998, at a cost of £1,043 million.
Scottish local authorities award grants for
improvement and repair. Scottish Homes also
has the power to provide grants to
complement the role of local authorities in
private house renewal. In Northern Ireland,
funding is allocated through the house
renovation grants scheme, administered by the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive, on a
similar basis to that in England and Wales. In
isolated rural areas, financial assistance to
replace dwellings which cannot be restored is
also on offer.
Homelessness
Local authorities have legal duties to provide
housing assistance for families and vulnerable
people who are eligible for assistance,
unintentionally homeless and in priority need.
The priority need group includes households
with dependent children or containing a
pregnant woman; people who are vulnerable as
a result of old age, mental or physical illness or
disability or other special reason; and people
who are homeless in an emergency. Changes
to the law on homelessness and the allocation
of council housing came into force in England
and Wales in 1997. The Government has

The Rough Sleepers Initiative was
established in 1990 in central London, where
the problem of people sleeping rough on the
streets has been especially acute; the third
phase of the initiative (1996-99) has received
£73 million in finance from the DETR to
provide outreach and resettlement work,
funding for hostels and nightshelters, and
further places in permanent accommodation
for rough sleepers. In central London the
number of people sleeping rough has fallen
from more than 1,000 to around 370 since
1992. This third phase of the initiative has
been extended to 27 areas outside London.
The Government has set a target to reduce
the level of rough sleeping by two-thirds by
the year 2002. From April 1999 a new body
will be set up to address the problem in
London, with resources of £143 million over
the three years to March 2002. Outside
London, the Government believes that local
authorities are best placed to bring together
the various agencies to tackle rough sleeping
and single homelessness. To support this
work, the DETR has announced a new £34
million Homelessness Action Programme of
grants to the voluntary sector.
The Department of Health operates the
Homeless Mentally 111 Initiative to provide
accommodation and psychiatric care for rough
sleepers with mental health problems. The
352
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
scheme has been extended from central
London to cover other centres across England
with a significant rough sleeping problem.
The Department also funds projects designed
to ensure that homeless people have access to
health services. The Scottish Rough Sleepers
Initiative has funding of £16 million for
1997— 98 to 1999—2000. In addition, a further
£9 million is available to tackle the problem of
empty properties in Scotland with a view to
increasing the supply of housing available to
those in need. In Wales, about £320,000 has
been committed to local schemes to alleviate
homelessness between 1997-98 and
1999-2000.
In Scotland £577,000 is being made in
1998- 99 to voluntary organisations tackling
homelessness, and in Wales £310,000. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive is
making available almost £381,000 to voluntary
groups involved with homelessness there.
Housing Advice
Under the Housing Act 1996, local authorities
have a duty to secure the provision of advice
to prevent homelessness. As well as housing
associations, other voluntary sector bodies
have a role to play in housing matters. Such
groups undertake a number of roles, for
example advising people about their rights
under housing law or encouraging energy
efficiency in the home. Government grants
totalling £7.9 million were paid to voluntary
sector organisations in England in 1997-98.
The largest project funded is the National
Homelessness Advice Service, provided by
Shelter and the National Association of
Citizens Advice Bureaux. In Scotland, aid
worth £1.4 million in 1998—99 is being given
to 21 voluntary bodies, including the
nationwide Scottish Homelessness Advisory
Service, for work on homelessness and other
housing matters. In Wales, £617,000 is
available to support national tenant
organisations and other bodies involved in
housing management education and training.
In Northern Ireland, the Government is
providing about £218,000 to the Housing
Rights Service, a voluntary organisation which
offers advice on all aspects of housing, and
£188,000 to the Northern Ireland Tenants
Action Project, which promotes the
participation of tenants in the management
of their homes.
REGENERATION
The main objective of the Government’s
policy on regeneration is to enhance economic
development and social cohesion through
effective regional action and integrated local
regeneration programmes. These support and
complement other programmes tackling social
and economic decline, and new initiatives,
such as Welfare-to-Work (see p. 155), health
action zones (see p. 191), employment zones
(see p. 155) and the work of the Cabinet Office
Social Exclusion Unit (see p. 115).
The Government is adopting a more
coherent and integrated approach to regional
economic development and planning, and
intends to improve regional accountability.
Together with devolution for Scotland and
Wales (see chapters 4 and 5), it will set up
Regional Development Agencies throughout
England and a strategic authority for London
(see chapter 2, pp. 7-9). The new Agencies
will formulate local priorities, and there will
be greater local decision-making. Some
regeneration programmes—notably the Single
Regeneration Budget and the New Deal for
Communities (see p. 354)—will retain a
competitive element. Existing partnerships
between the private and public sectors will be
strengthened. Sustainability will be a central
focus, including a strong commitment to a
‘green approach’.
The nine Government Offices for the
Regions (GOs—see p. 7) currently carry out
many local regeneration and development
functions, working in partnership with local
communities, including local government and
business, to maximise economic prosperity
and quality of life. The aim is to overcome the
causes of local and regional social and
economic decline, such as unemployment,
poor housing, crime, poor health and a
degraded environment.
The new Regional Development Agencies,
of which the eight outside London are
expected to be operational from April 1999,
will have several functions—including
drawing up strategies covering sustainable
353
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
economic development, social and physical
regeneration, competitiveness and innovation,
and co-ordinating work in areas such as
business support, inward investment, training
and regeneration. They will work closely with
the GOs (sharing the same boundaries), local
authorities and Training and Enterprise
Councils (see p. 153).
Rundown areas in the UK benefit from EU
Structural Funds (see p. 79), notably the
European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF), which finances infrastructure
projects and support for industry, among
other things. Objectives for the Funds include
regenerating areas affected by industrial
decline and combating long-term
unemployment. Substantial funding is
available—in England alone some £1^30
million is being allocated from the ERDF
during the period 1997-99. The structure and
allocations of EU funding are under review.
England
The Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions has overall
responsibility for the Single Regeneration
Budget (SRB) and the New Deal for
Communities (NDC).
The SRB, with a budget of £1,116 million
for 1998-99, aims to promote flexible and
locally responsive forms of regeneration. The
main programmes funded by the SRB are
administered at present by the GOs; this
function will be taken over by Regional
Development Agencies (except in London)
from April 1999. More than 500 local
regeneration schemes have been started under
the first three rounds of the SRB Challenge
Fund since 1994. These have created or
safeguarded about 117,000 jobs and attracted
£840 million of private sector financing.
A total of 121 schemes stand to receive over
£300 million under a fourth round. The
schemes focus mainly on social exclusion,
employment, training, education, housing,
community safety, drug misuse prevention,
healthcare and childcare. The aim is to attract
private sector support of more than £400
million, in addition to other public sector
contributions (including EU funding)
amounting to more than £500 million, over
their lifetime of up to seven years. The
schemes will benefit over 600,000
schoolchildren, provide training for 86,000
people and jobs for over 50,000 residents and
launch community safety projects affecting in
excess of 3 million people.
In total, some £1,700 million will be
available for new regeneration projects during
the three years to 1999—2000. These, it is
hoped, will create or safeguard 650,000 jobs,
support over 90,000 new businesses, complete
or improve 250,000 homes and support over
40,000 voluntary or community groups. On
average, every £1 of Challenge Fund money is
estimated to attract £2.50 of private sector
investment.
The New Deal for Communities aims to
tackle multiple deprivation in the poorest
areas. Building on a report of the Social
Exclusion Unit (Bringing Britain Together: a
National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal),
the NDC was launched in September 1998,
with resources of £800 million earmarked for
the following three years. The initiative is
intended to improve job prospects, bring
together investment in buildings and in
people, and improve neighbourhood
management and the delivery of local services.
Initially, one ‘pathfinder’ partnership,
involving local people, community and
voluntary organisations, public agencies, local
authorities and business, will form in each of
17 selected local authority districts, and bid
for government funding based on the
formulation of proposals to deliver intensive,
locally focused regeneration in identified
neighbourhoods (typically including
1,000-4,000 households). Successful
partnerships will be funded for up to ten years.
Two programmes which have been
significant contributors to regeneration came
to an end in 1998:
• Under the City Challenge initiative, local
authorities were invited, in partnership
with the private and voluntary sectors,
local communities and government
agencies, to submit plans for regenerating
key urban neighbourhoods by tackling
problems of physical decay, lack of
economic opportunity and poor quality of
life. There were two rounds of the City
Challenge competition, with 31 successful
354
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
partnerships each receiving government
funding of £37.5 million over five years.
• Twelve Urban Development
Corporations (UDCs) were responsible
for regenerating selected inner city areas,
including London Docklands,
Merseyside, Leeds, Bristol, Teesside, and
Tyne and Wear, between 1981 and April
1998. (Many unfinished key projects from
six UDCs passed to English Partnerships
on 31 March 1998 for completion.)
English Partnerships
The key objectives of English Partnerships, a
government agency, are to promote job
creation, inward investment and improve the
environment, through the reclamation and
development of vacant, derelict and
contaminated land throughout England. It
works with other public bodies and the private
and voluntary sectors. In 1997-98 English
Partnerships’ £315 million development
programme created or safeguarded 29,000
jobs, reclaimed or serviced 1,350 hectares
(2,700 acres) of land and attracted £767
million in private finance. It helped to create
7,540 homes and developed over 860,000 sq m
of commercial and industrial floor space.
Through generating higher receipts, reflecting
the Agency’s increasingly commercial nature,
the 1998—99 development programme is
expected to be over £400 million. This
includes a ten-year package of regeneration
plans in the coalfield areas, with the potential
to generate 56,000 permanent jobs.
From April 1999 English Partnerships’
regional staff and activities will transfer
(outside London) to the new Regional
Development Agencies. English Partnerships’
national functions will continue into 2000
when it will merge with the Commission for
New Towns to form a new body.
Millennium Experience
The Millennium Experience, to celebrate the
start of the third millennium, will take place at
Greenwich in London from December 1999
on a 320-hectare (800-acre) derelict site on the
banks of the River Thames. Its budget is £758
million, with funding from government, the
National Lottery (see p. 120) and private
sponsorship. Education and technology for the
future will be key features of the exhibits.
Current plans also include the development,
on adjacent land, of 5,000 homes, a business
district, and industrial and retail areas. Seven
of the most deprived boroughs in the UK
surround the exhibition area. Over 12 million
paying visitors are expected to attend the
Exhibition, which will last at least 12 months.
Parks, lakes and riverside walks will be a
permanent legacy. Projects and events
celebrating the new millennium will take place
in many other parts of the UK (see p. 120).
The Millennium Experience’s centrepiece
will be a Dome, 320 m wide and 50 m high,
designed by the Richard Rogers
Partnership. The Dome will be the biggest
ever built, being 1 km in circumference and
with 80,000 sq m of floor space and a
circular central area seating 12,500 people.
There will be 12 large-scale exhibition
zones, covering many subjects. For example,
‘the Body Zone’ will have a giant human
figure, with exhibits on human biology and
medical science, while ‘Living Island’ covers
a typical UK seaside resort, with choices on
how to protect the environment.
Public Sector Land
The DETR promotes the sale and
development of vacant and under-used public
sector land in England. Information is being
assembled on potential key sites and, where
there are no firm plans to market or develop
them, action will be taken to promote their
sale. Under the ‘Public Request to Order
Disposal’ scheme, members of the public are
encouraged to ask the Government to instruct
public bodies to dispose of vacant or under¬
used land on the open market.
Rural Development
Although most of the problems arising from
dereliction and unemployment occur in urban
areas, some rural areas have also been affected
as employment in traditional sectors, such as
agriculture, mining and rurally based defence
355
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
establishments, has declined. Low wages
remain a characteristic of many rural areas and
the decline of local public transport and other
services has caused problems for some rural
residents. The movement of people into the
countryside from the towns has increased the
demand for housing and, with the major
projected growth in the number of
households, this is likely to continue.
However, some rural areas have been
successful in recent years in attracting high-
technology industries, while the spread of
modern telecommunications facilities,
permitting home use of e-mail, fax machines,
the Internet and other IT services, has made it
much easier for people to work from home.
At present the Rural Development
Commission (RDC) is the government agency
concerned with the economic well-being of the
people who live and work in rural England.
About 87% of its £43 million annual budget is
targeted at 31 Rural Development Areas, which
cover 35% of the land area of England and 2.75
million people. Expenditure within these areas
is used to diversify the rural economy and
strengthen rural communities through projects
developed in partnership with the private,
public and voluntary sectors. The Commission
also supports the voluntary sector and key
services countrywide. Nationally, it has an
important role in advising and influencing
government and other organisations. In April
1999 the RDC’s rural regeneration
programmes are due to transfer to the new
Regional Development Agencies, while its
advisory functions and support for rural
communities and services will be transferred to
a new countryside agency to be formed by a
merger of the RDC with the Countryside
Commission (see also chapter 20).
Wales
Parts of Wales have been adversely affected by
the decline in traditional industries, especially
the coal industry. In particular, the south
Wales valleys have some of the most
economically disadvantaged communities.
The 1993—98 Programme for the Valleys built
on previous programmes for the area, with the
aim of continuing economic, social and
environmental regeneration—through the
creation of jobs; improved training, education
and transport; a better environment; a wider
choice of quality housing; and improvements
to the health of local people. In 1997 the
Government announced a new initiative for
regenerating the Valleys, including proposals
for the development of industrial villages—
new small and medium-sized high-technology
companies supplying larger firms located near
the M4 motorway in Wales.
In March 1998 the Government announced
that it was setting up a new ‘Rural
Partnership’ of organisations in Wales with an
interest in the countryside. The Partnership is
intended as a means of reviewing the policies
and programmes already in place for the well¬
being of rural communities, and as a source of
ideas for tackling rural problems.
The Welsh Capital Challenge (WCC),
supports an integrated approach to capital
expenditure which promotes regeneration or
development, and benefits disadvantaged
urban and rural areas in Wales. In 1997—98 the
WCC awarded £20 million for projects
commencing in that year and an additional
£12 million for future commitments,
generating over £27 million of private sector
investment. In the longer term this assistance
is expected to stimulate further investment of
nearly £80 million by the private sector and
create an additional 1,800 jobs. The Strategic
Development Scheme supports local authority
strategies and projects for economic,
environmental and social development which
benefits areas of social need. It encourages
local partnerships involving the community,
voluntary and private sectors.
The redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay area
is one of the biggest regeneration projects in
Europe. The project is promoted by the
Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, which
is receiving government support of almost £45
million in 1998-99. A new barrage across the
harbour mouth should be completed early in
1999. It is expected that about 29,000 new jobs
will be created in the Cardiff Bay area, 5,900
new homes built, 1.15 million sq m of business
space created and over £1,500 million of
private investment attracted. A 400-hectare
(1,000-acre) bird reserve being provided
nearby will help compensate for the loss of the
Cardiff Bay habitat.
356
PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Under the Government of Wales Act 1998
(see chapter 5), a new ‘economic powerhouse’
has brought together three of the main public
bodies in Wales concerned with regeneration:
• the Welsh Development Agency (WDA)
which, together with local authorities and
the private sector, has worked to
regenerate and revitalise towns and cities
throughout Wales, and has a key role in
attracting inward investment. The WDA
estimates that some £159 million of
private sector investment has been
attracted to urban areas during the last
three years. For example, Urban
Investment Grant encourages private
sector developments on derelict and
rundown sites in urban areas; the
1998-99 budget is almost £12.5 million.
• the Development Board for Rural Wales,
responsible for building industrial and
commercial premises, providing a range
of services to business and promoting
rural Wales abroad as a suitable location
for inward investment; and
• the Land Authority for Wales, a statutory
body with powers to make land available
for urban progress, employment and
social housing in circumstances where
the private sector would find this
difficult on its own.
The powerhouse—an expanded WDA—
covers urban and rural Wales. It offers a range
of services to business; provides the land, sites
and premises needed by new and expanding
businesses; and acts as a single point of contact
for inward investors.
Since 1991 resources totalling £129
million have been made available for area
renewal schemes in Wales. These involve the
local authority working with other public
bodies, the private sector and local
communities to develop co-ordinated ten-
year strategies involving housing, the
environment and the local economy. To date,
21 renewal areas have been declared,
comprising over 19,500 homes.
Scotland
The Government has announced that new long¬
term Social Inclusion Partnerships will be set up
in Scotland, targeted on areas of greatest need
and the most needy members of society. They
will co-ordinate and fill gaps between existing
urban regeneration programmes (see below). It
is intended that Social Inclusion Partnerships
will be multi-agency arrangements, comprising
all relevant local partners, including
representatives of the voluntary and private
sectors, with the local community at the centre
of the process. The existing 12 Priority
Partnership Areas and 11 Regeneration
Programmes designated under the Programme
for Partnership policy framework will convert
into this new form of partnership, and will focus
more closely on promoting social inclusion in
communities. A sum of £16 million will be
available in 1999—2000 to support the work of
the new partnerships.
Local Enterprise Companies (LECs—see
p. 153), working under contract to Scottish
Enterprise, have substantial budgets and a
range of powers and functions to improve the
environment and encourage business and
employment in their areas. Responsibility for
derelict land reclamation also rests with
Scottish Enterprise, LECs and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise. They may acquire and
reclaim land either by agreement or
compulsorily; they seek to work closely with
the private sector to bring land back into use.
A Partnership Fund supports rural
partnerships of government departments and
agencies, private sector bodies and voluntary
groups with responsibilities in rural areas. A
National Rural Partnership encourages the
formation of such local associations and
advises on spending priorities for the Fund.
Northern Ireland
The DOENI leads an urban regeneration
drive through its Urban Regeneration Group
(URG), which has a budget of about £48
million for 1998-99. The URG aims to
improve economic, social and environmental
conditions, its main focus of activity being
deprived and rundown areas. It operates in
conjunction with other government and public
sector bodies and through grants to the private
sector, including community and voluntary
groups. It also works with the International
Fund for Ireland (IFI, see p. 18) and
357
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
implements parts of several EU programmes,
which provide additional financial assistance.
A major new strategy document for the
development of Northern Ireland up to
2025—Shaping Our Future—was released in
1997. Following extensive consultation, a
Regional Strategic Framework is expected to
be published by the end of 1998, taking into
account the need for a coherent and integrated
approach towards economic, social,
environmental and community development.
Urban Development Grant (UDG) is
Northern Ireland’s principal urban
regeneration measure. Its objective is the
economic and physical renovation of inner-
city areas of Belfast and Londonderry, by
encouraging private enterprise and investment
in property development, leading to job
creation and improvement of the
environment. Since 1983, £72 million of
UDG is estimated to have generated £253
million of private sector investment in Belfast,
while in Londonderry grant worth £32 million
has brought in some £116 million of private
funding. Projected UDG expenditure for the
two cities in 1998—99 is £3.5 million. City
Partnership Boards have been set up in Belfast
and Londonderry, with representatives of the
public, private, trade union and voluntary
sectors. They aim to turn 25-year strategic
visions of city development into reality.
The Community Economic Regeneration
Scheme (CERS), launched in 1989 to focus on
Belfast and Londonderry and larger towns,
and the Community Regeneration and
Improvement Special Programme (CRISP),
launched in 1990, for small towns, are
designed to provide facilities such as
workshops and commercial outlets, and help
to boost local employment in areas where the
private sector is reluctant to invest. Both
schemes are funded by the DOENI with the

In Belfast the Laganside Development
Corporation is charged with regenerating the
once derelict area around Belfast docks and
the city’s waterfront. Its annual DOENI grant
is about £7 million. The estimated investment
in Laganside since 1989 has been about £140
million, in addition to the Corporation’s own
expenditure. Developments in 1998 include
the opening of the Belfast Hilton Hotel and
completion of the BT office project at Lanyon
Place. The Making Belfast Work initiative
(MBW) aims to tackle the problems of the
city’s most disadvantaged areas, by increasing
employability and improving the quality of
life. By March 1998 the MBW had received
around £200 million. The work of the
DOENI’s Belfast Development Office and of
the MBW will be merged and become the
responsibility of a Belfast Regeneration Office,
and a new strategy will identify the priorities
in urban regeneration for the city.
The Londonderry Regeneration Initiative
addresses dereliction, social deprivation and
economic difficulties, targeting resources at
the most disadvantaged areas and groups in
the city. Partnership arrangements encourage
the participation of local people and
community and voluntary organisations in the
delivery of the Initiative. By March 1998 it
had provided resources of almost £25 million;
the allocation in 1998—99 is £2.7 million.
EU programmes implemented through the
URG include the Special Support Programme
for Peace and Reconciliation (see p. 18), whose
sub-programmes seek to promote urban
regeneration and to improve the social and
physical environment, develop derelict sites,
enhance areas where sectarian conflict has been
marked, and provide amenities and new
employment opportunities in areas of greatest
need.

In July 1998 the Government set out its integrated transport policy, which is
designed to make better use of existing facilities and infrastructure, with a
higher priority for more environmentally sustainable forms of transport, such
as walking, cycling and public transport. Extra resources are being allocated for
the modernisation of public transport and to maintain the major roads. The
UK has one of the most open telecommunications markets in the world, and
telecommunications services are developing rapidly, with, for example, a
substantial rise in the number of mobile telephone subscribers.

TRAVEL TRENDS
Even though passenger travel (in terms of
passenger-kilometres) declined during the
early 1990s, the trend of recent decades has
been for a substantial rise, and passenger
travel rose by 1.5% in 1997 to 717,000 million
passenger-kilometres (see Table 22.1). Travel
by car, van and taxi has doubled in the past 25
years, and air travel has also grown
substantially. However, travel by bus and
coach and by bicycle has fallen. Motorcycle
usage grew between 1973 and 1981, but has
now fallen back to the level of the 1970s. Rail
travel has also fluctuated, and has recently
been growing again after a period of decline in
the first half of the 1990s. In general, public
transport is used less in the UK than in other
countries in the European Union (EU).
Travel by car remains by far the most
popular mode of passenger travel, accounting
for 86% of passenger mileage within Great
Britain in 1997 (see chart). Most freight is
carried by road, which accounts for 81% of
goods by tonnage and 67% in terms of
tonne-kilometres.1
Car ownership has increased markedly—
70% of households in the UK owned one or
more cars in 1996-97, 21.5% two or more cars
and 4.5% three or more cars. At the end of
1997 there were 27 million vehicles licensed
for use on the roads of Great Britain,
including 21.7 million cars (of which 2.3
million were company-owned); 2.3 million
light goods vehicles; 414,000 other goods
vehicles; 626,000 motorcycles, scooters and
1 A tonne-kilometre is equivalent to 1 tonne transported for
1 kilometre.

TRANSPORT POLICY
In July 1998 the Government issued a White
Paper, A New Deal for Transport: Better for
Everyone, setting out its policy for creating an
integrated transport system to tackle the
growing problems of congestion and pollution.
It envisages a system that is safe, efficient, clean
and fair.
The main proposals in the White Paper
include:
• better integration between different types
of transport, to improve connections;
integration between transport policy and
policy on the environment and land use
planning, so that the environment will be
protected and the need to travel reduced;
and integration between transport policy
and policies on education, health and
wealth creation;
• new local transport plans, in which local
authorities will set out their five-year
strategies for transport;
• new sources of funding for local
authorities, including charges for driving
into town centres and for workplace
parking, which will enable them to tackle
congestion and boost public transport;
• better local bus services, through
upgraded ‘quality partnerships’ between
local authorities and bus operators, and
national minimum concessionary bus
fares for pensioners;
• a new Strategic Rail Authority (see p. 368);
• better information for travellers,
including a national public transport
information system to be introduced by
the year 2000;
• improved motoring conditions, with
greater resources for road maintenance and
better traffic information and management;
• a review of safety arrangements across all
transport modes; and
• development of regional ports and
airports, so that they play their full part
in meeting local demand.
A new Commission for Integrated
Transport will provide independent advice
to the Government on the implementation
of the integrated transport policy and
review progress towards meeting
government objectives. For example, it
will advise on lorry weights and the
development of rail freight, on the review
of transport safety arrangements, and on
setting targets for road traffic and public
transport.
Legislation will be required to implement
some of the proposals, for example, to enable
local authorities to charge for driving into
town centres and for parking at workplaces.
The Government will continue to play an
active role in helping to develop EU policies
for supporting sustainable transport (see
P- 78).
The White Paper’s approach covers the
whole of the UK. Separate but
complementary White Papers/policy
documents have been issued for Scotland and
Wales—a statement covering Northern
Ireland is planned later in 1998. A selection of
the main points is given below.
Wales
The integrated approach to transport policy in
Wales envisages improved public transport in
both urban and rural areas—in the latter,
£2.25 million a year will be available for new
and better rural bus services and £250,000 a
year for community transport schemes. All
major employers are being encouraged to
prepare green transport plans, with particular
emphasis on car sharing, and the Welsh Office
aims to produce its own plan by March 1999.
It is working with rail and air operators to
improve existing services between north and
south Wales, and to introduce new ones, while
better north-south road links are also to be
considered.
The Welsh Transport Advisory Group,
which includes representatives of most
organisations with an interest in transport
issues in Wales, has advised on the
361
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
development and implementation of an
integrated transport policy. It will also
produce a report on transport in Wales for the
new National Assembly for Wales (see chapter
5), which will be developing transport policies
further.
Scotland
Proposed improvements for transport in
Scotland were set out in the White Paper
Travel Choices for Scotland. Local authorities
will play an important role through developing
new integrated local transport strategies which
will be a key part of the improvements. They
will be supported by a Public Transport
Fund, which will provide £90 million over
three years to support developments such as
new railway stations, ‘park-and-ride’ facilities,
and bus priority schemes. There will also be
scope for local authorities and transport
operators to work in partnership through new
regional transport bodies which will be set up
to improve transport co-ordination.
For many remote communities in rural
Scotland, the car is expected to remain the
main form of transport. The Government will
provide £4.5 million a year to support rural
transport provision: £3.5 million for public
transport services, £600,000 for community
transport projects and £440,000 to fuel
stations to support the availability of rural fuel
supplies.
Developments in transport policy in
Scotland will be taken forward by the Scottish
Parliament and Executive (see chapter 4).
Expenditure
Under the Comprehensive Spending Review
(see p. 389), transport is one of the key areas
where extra public expenditure is being
allocated over the next three years, with
spending in 2001-02 being 18% higher in real
terms than in 1998-99. An extra £1,100
million is being provided over the three years
to 2001-02 for modernising local and public
transport and developing over 150 new local
integrated transport strategies, while £700
million is being allocated to halt the decline in
the condition of major motorways and trunk
roads.
Public Private Partnerships (see p. 392) will
have an increasingly important role in
transport, with greater private sector
investment expected, for example, in roads
and railways.
EU funding is available for the
development of transport Trans European
Networks. For 1998, funding of projects in the
UK totals £28 million, of which £23.5 million
is towards the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (see
p. 370) and the modernisation of the West
Coast Main Line (see p. 369).
ROADS
The total road network in Great Britain in
1997 was 369,870 kilometres (229,800 miles).
Trunk motorways2 accounted for 3,250
kilometres (2,019 miles) of this, less than 1%,
and other trunk roads for over 12,260
kilometres (7,620 miles), or 3.3%. However,
motorways carry 17% of all traffic, and trunk
roads another 17%. Combined, they carry
over half of all goods vehicle traffic in Great
Britain. In Northern Ireland the road network
is over 24,000 kilometres (15,000 miles), of
which 111 kilometres (69 miles) are
motorways.
Motor traffic in Great Britain in 1997 rose
by 1.4% to an estimated 448,900 million
vehicle-kilometres (see Table 22.2). Traffic on
motorways has been growing particularly
quickly, rising by 57% between 1987 and 1997
to 78,500 million vehicle-kilometres, reflecting
increases in motorway length as well as traffic
flow.
Management
Responsibility for trunk roads, including most
motorways, rests in England with the
Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions, and in Scotland
and Wales with the appropriate Secretary of
State, while local authorities are responsible
for non-trunk roads. Central government
meets most of the costs of construction and
maintenance of trunk roads. The Highways

of central government rather than the local authority.

Agency, an executive agency of the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions (DETR), is responsible for
maintaining, operating and improving
motorways and trunk roads in England. In
Northern Ireland the Roads Service, an
agency of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland, is responsible for the
construction, improvement and maintenance
of all public roads.
Private sector finance is playing a role
under ‘Design, Build, Finance and Operate’
(DBFO) contracts. Under these schemes, the
private sector provides the funding for
construction and maintenance, and receives
government payments linked to usage and
performance. The payment mechanism to the
contractors has been reviewed, so that the
system better reflects the Government’s
integrated transport policy. In future, DBFO
companies will be required to ensure
maximum availability of roadspace for users,
for example, by completing roadworks
quickly, and there will be supplementary
payments for a good safety record and
incentives to provide a good road service for
buses and heavy goods vehicles.
• setting a separate budget to tackle some
of the most difficult noise problems;
• adopting a new approach to trunk road
planning through the regional planning
system (see chapter 21) to work within an
overall regional transport and land use
strategy;
• devolving responsibility for 40% of the
present trunk road network to local
authorities, so that roads can be managed
in the context of local transport plans;
and
• developing a fresh approach to evaluating
new road proposals, against the criteria of
accessibility, safety, and effect on the
environment, while ensuring that all
decisions reflect the integrated transport
policy and that good value for money is
obtained.
In Wales a new core network of trunk
roads, comprising key east-west links in north
and south Wales and important north-south
roads, will be the starting-point for future
investment priorities.
Road Programme
Reviews of the motorway and trunk road
network have been conducted in England and
Wales, and a review in Scotland is in progress.
Features of the new policy in England are:
• adopting new priorities, with top priority
for maintenance, while giving much
greater emphasis to making better use of
existing roads, and to the environment;
Licensing and Standards
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
maintains official records of drivers and
vehicles in Great Britain. Records for

tractors, and disabled people receiving a
mobility allowance;
363
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
In England 37 road schemes, costing a
total of X 1,400 million, have been
approved. Among the largest are:
• improvements to 22 kilometres (14
miles) of the A1(M) in Yorkshire,
costing some £210 million;
• a new dual carriageway in a tunnel to
remove traffic from the immediate
vicinity of the World Heritage Site at
Stonehenge (Wiltshire), at a cost of
£125 million, part of which will be
funded from heritage sources; and
• a £94 million scheme to widen to 12
lanes the sections of the M2 5 near
Heathrow Airport, which are the
most heavily used sections of the UK
motorway network, with flows of up
to 200,000 vehicles a day. A study of
the M25 has also been announced, to
develop a long-term management
strategy for the motorway and
adjacent sections of radial routes,
covering all modes of transport,
changes in land use and links with
local transport networks.
• 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver),
motorcycles and goods vehicles not over
3.5 tonnes maximum weight;
• 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5,
but not over 7.5, tonnes; and
• 21 for passenger vehicles with more than
nine seats and goods vehicles over 7.5
tonnes.
New drivers of motor vehicles must pass
both the practical driving test and a separate
written theory test in order to acquire a full
driving licence. In 1997, 1.1 million driving
tests were conducted in Great Britain by the
Driving Standards Agency (DSA), the national
driver testing authority. Some 47% of drivers
passed the test, raising the number of holders of
a car full driving licence to about 30.6 million.
The DSA also supervises professional driving
instructors and the compulsory basic training
scheme for learner motorcyclists.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles
are allowed on the roads, they must meet
safety and environmental requirements, based
primarily on standards drawn up by the EU.
The Vehicle Certification Agency is
responsible for ensuring these requirements
are met through a process known as ‘type
approval’.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles,
through their annual testing. It also uses
roadside and other enforcement checks to
ensure that drivers and vehicle operators
comply with legislation. In Northern Ireland
the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency is
responsible for testing drivers and vehicles
under statutory schemes broadly similar to
those in Great Britain.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a
good record on road safety, with the lowest
road accident death rate for adults in the EU.
In 1997, 3,599 deaths occurred in road
accidents in Great Britain, the second lowest
annual figure since records began in 1926,
while there were 43,000 serious injuries and
281,000 slight injuries.
Since 1981-85 there has been a significant
decline in deaths and serious casualties, by
36% and 42% respectively, while road traffic
has risen by 52% in this period.
Developments in vehicle safety standards,
improvements in roads, traffic-calming
measures (such as road humps) and the
introduction of legislation on seat-belt wearing
have contributed to this long-term decline.
However, slight injuries are 16% higher, so
that the total of 327,500 casualties in 1997 is
2% more than the yearly average for 1981-85.
The Government is drawing up a new road
safety strategy. It wishes in particular to
improve the safety of vulnerable road users,
including pedestrians, cyclists and
motorcyclists, in a way that is consistent with
encouraging more cycling and walking.
During 1998 it has been consulting on
proposals to combat the problem of drinking
and driving, including whether the current
legal blood alcohol limit of 80 milligrammes
364
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
(mg) per 100 millilitres should be reduced to
50 mg.
Congestion
Traffic congestion in the UK is particularly
bad in towns and cities. Traffic management
schemes are used in many urban areas to
reduce congestion, create a better
environment and improve road safety. They
include facilities for pedestrians and cyclists
(such as traffic-free shopping precincts),
traffic-calming measures, bus lanes, and
controls on on-street parking. In London a
505-km (315-mile) network of priority ‘red
routes’, subject to special stopping controls, is
being introduced to improve traffic flow.
The Government is encouraging employers
to find ways of reducing the impact on traffic
congestion and on the environment of their
employees’ travel patterns, especially for
commuting to work. It is supporting
companies, such as Boots and BAA, which
have company travel plans to encourage fewer
staff to travel to work by car and more to use
public transport, cycling, walking, or car¬
sharing arrangements.
However, in the Government’s view
further steps are needed to tackle the
problems of congestion and pollution.
Legislation is envisaged to allow local
authorities to introduce charging schemes for
road users and to levy a charge on workplace
parking, where these measures can help to
deliver the objectives which will be set out in
their local transport plans. The Government
will be consulting on how the schemes will be
implemented, and plans a number of pilot
schemes. A trial of how drivers respond to
charging when offered an enhanced public
transport alternative has been carried out in
Leicester.
Traffic Information
A series of traffic control centres throughout
the UK provide information about traffic
conditions on roadside electronic variable
message signs. These facilities and related
traffic management measures help optimise
the capacity and flow of traffic, particularly on
the strategic road network. A series of regional
In April 1998 a new EU-wide initiative,
ALTER (Alternative Traffic in Towns),
was launched to help to produce healthier
towns and cities. Oxford is one of six
initial participants, along with Athens,
Barcelona, Florence, Lisbon and
Stockholm. Participating cities will be
giving preferential access in certain
sensitive areas, such as city centres, to
vehicles meeting strict standards, such as
zero or low-emission vehicles.
traffic control centres is planned in England.
There are also in-vehicle information services,
which are provided in partnership with private
sector organisations. They include
Trafficmaster’s congestion warning
information system and the Radio Data
System-Traffic Message Channel, both of
which are available throughout much of the
UK for suitably equipped vehicles.
Cycling and Walking
Cycling has been declining over a long period,
with mileage travelled now around a fifth of
that in the early 1950s. A National Cycling
Strategy, launched in 1996, encourages
greater use of bicycles and aims to double the
number of cycling journeys by 2002 and to
double the level again by 2012. The National
Cycling Forum is co-ordinating its
implementation and the strategy has been
endorsed by the Government. Local
authorities are being encouraged to give
greater priority to cycling and to improve
conditions for cyclists by, for example,
providing designated cycle routes.
The Government is supporting the
National Cycle Network, a linked series of
traffic-free paths and roads with traffic-
calming features, which is being developed by
the transport charity Sustrans to open up new
opportunities for commuter, tourist and
recreational cycling. About 600 miles (970
kilometres) are in use, and a further 3,000
miles (4,800 kilometres) should be completed
by 2000, with the network reaching 8,000
miles (12,800 kilometres) by 2005.
365
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
According to the first statistical report on
walking in the UK, published in June
1998, people are walking significantly less
than in the past, with fewer journeys on
foot and many more by car. In particular,
many fewer children now walk to school.
The Government wishes to reverse this
trend, and is expecting local authorities to
give more priority to walking by providing,
for example, wider pavements,
pedestrianisation schemes, more direct,
safer and convenient routes for walking,
and more pedestrian crossings.
Residents in urban areas tend to walk
more than those in rural areas—for
example, in 1994-96 inner London
residents made about 40% of their
journeys on foot, compared with 23% for
residents of rural areas.
Road Haulage
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles
amounted to 149,600 million tonne-kilometres
in Great Britain in 1997, 2% more than in
1996. There has been a move towards larger
and more efficient vehicles carrying heavier
loads—84% of the traffic, in terms of tonne-
kilometres, is now carried by vehicles of over
25 tonnes gross weight. Journey lengths are
increasing, with the average haul now being 91
kilometres (57 miles), 34% longer than in
1980. Hauliers licensed to transport other
firms’ goods account for 75% of freight
carried in terms of tonne-kilometres.
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1997 about 1.9 million road goods
vehicles were ferried to mainland Europe, of
which 543,000 were powered vehicles registered
in the UK. In 1997 UK vehicles carried 7.5
million tonnes internationally, and about 94%
of this traffic was with the EU.
There are about 113,000 holders of an
operator’s licence (which is required for
operating goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross
weight) in the UK, and 402,000 large goods
vehicles. About 88% of operators have fleets
of five or fewer vehicles.
EC regulations prescribe maximum limits
on driving times and minimum requirements
for breaks and rest periods for most drivers of
heavy goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. Drivers’
activities are monitored automatically by a
tachograph—a recording device in the cab.
The current general maximum weight in
the UK for goods vehicles with five or more
axles is 38 tonnes, which will rise to 40 tonnes
in January 1999 to conform with EU
requirements. As this will cause greater road
damage, the Government has developed a
strategy to make more use of six-axle lorries,
which would be less damaging to roads and
bridges. Accordingly, it will allow 41-tonne
lorries with six axles and suitable suspension
on UK roads from the beginning of 1999. In
addition, it intends to ask the proposed
Commission for Integrated Transport to
consider the case for allowing the general use
of 44-tonne lorries with six axles—these
lorries are already permitted for combined
road/rail operations, as an incentive to
encourage rail freight.
Bus Services
In 1996-97 some 4,355 million passenger
journeys were made on local bus services in
Great Britain, 18% fewer than in 1986-87.
Usage declined in all areas except London,
where journeys rose by 7% in this period.
However, services in terms of bus mileage
operated have increased since the industry was
deregulated in the mid-1980s.
Most local bus services are provided
commercially, with 85% of bus mileage
outside London operated on this basis. Local
authorities may subsidise services which are
not commercially viable but are considered to
be socially necessary. Outside London,
operators may provide services without
restriction, although controls may be imposed
on the number of vehicles if this would
otherwise cause congestion or danger to other
road users.
Operators
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by companies in the private sector,
apart from 17 bus companies run by local
authorities. London Transport (LT), a
statutory corporation, is responsible for
366
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
providing or procuring public transport in
London. It oversees about 700 bus routes run
by private sector companies under contract.
Following a series of mergers and
takeovers, five main groups now operate bus
services: Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead
Group, National Express and Stagecoach.
These have become substantial
undertakings—for example, FirstGroup has
over 20 separate bus operations, with a fleet of
more than 8,000 vehicles. All the main groups
except Arriva are involved in running rail
services, while some have diversified into
running bus services in other countries.
In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are operated by subsidiaries
of the publicly owned Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company (NITHC),
collectively known as ‘Translink’. Citybus Ltd
operates services in Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd
runs most of the services in the rest of Northern
Ireland, carrying respectively 25 million and 55
million passengers a year. There are also over
100 small privately owned undertakings, most
of which operate fewer than five vehicles. The
future of the NITHC is being reviewed.
Future Developments
The Government sees an important role for
bus services as the basis of an efficient public
transport system, especially in areas where no
other form of public transport is available.
Significant improvements in services have
been achieved in several areas, such as
Aberdeen, Birmingham, Brighton, Edinburgh,
Leeds and Swansea, through partnerships
between local authorities and bus operators.
Service improvements have arisen from
measures including:
• bus priority measures, such as bus lanes
and traffic light priority signalling;
• ‘park-and-ride’ services, where travellers
leave their cars on the outskirts of a town
and travel into the centre by bus;
• new, high-quality buses providing easy
access, which is of particular benefit to
the elderly and disabled;
• improved ticketing arrangements, such as
tickets covering both buses and trains;
and
• better interchanges, such as new bus
stations in Sheffield and Belfast
(Laganside), which also have advanced
electronic passenger information systems.
Partnerships have also been successful in
rural areas. For example, around Pwllheli in
north Wales, Gwynedd County Council has
worked closely with local bus operators.
Services operated by modern low-floor
vehicles are timed to connect with other bus
and rail services where possible. As a result,
bus patronage has risen by 22% in two years.
Coaches
Long-distance coach services in the UK are
provided by private sector companies. The
biggest operator, National Express, has a
national network of routes and in 1997 carried
15.6 million passengers on its UK express coach
services linking 1,200 destinations. Coaches and
minibuses carrying three or more children now
have to be fitted with seatbelts on all seats.
Taxis
There are about 55,300 licensed taxis in England
and Wales, mainly in urban areas, around 8,500
in Scotland, and about 7,000 in Northern
Ireland. In London (which has around 18,900
taxis) and several other major cities, taxis must
be purpose-built to conform to strict
requirements. In many districts, taxi drivers
have to pass a test of their knowledge of the area.
Private hire vehicles with drivers
(‘minicabs’) may be booked only through the
operator and not hired on the street. In most
areas outside London, private hire vehicles are
licensed; there are about 66,000 in England
and Wales outside the capital. It is estimated
that at least 60,000 minicabs operate in the
London area. The Private Hire Vehicles
(London) Act 1998 will regulate these vehicles
in London, with a new licensing system for
minicab drivers, vehicles and operators which
is due to start in 1999.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
367
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
1825, was the first public passenger railway in
the world to be worked by steam power.
Privatisation of railway services in Great
Britain, involving the sale of about 100 railway
operations run by the former British Rail, was
completed in 1997. The main system now
involves Railtrack, which is responsible for
operating all track and infrastructure; three
rolling stock companies, which lease
locomotives and passenger carriages; 25
passenger train operating companies; four
freight service providers; seven infrastructure
maintenance companies; and six track renewal
companies.
Rail Regulation
There are currently two main bodies
overseeing rail services:
• The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising
(OPRAF) is responsible for negotiating,
awarding and monitoring the franchises
for operating rail services. Each
agreement specifies provisions governing
the contractual level of passenger services
to be provided by the operator, for
example, on the frequency of trains and
stations served, and, in general, provides
for gradually reducing subsidies to the
franchisee. Support for passenger rail
services amounted to over £ 1,400 million
in 1997-98.
• The functions of the Office of the Rail
Regulator include licensing the new
railway operators, dealing with
agreements governing access by operators
to track and stations, and promoting and
protecting rail users’ interests. It
sponsors a network of statutory rail users’
consultative committees which represent
the interests of passengers.
Strategic Rail Authority
The Government wishes to see tighter
regulation of the railway industry. It therefore
intends to introduce legislation to establish a
Strategic Rail Authority, a statutory body
which will support the Government’s
integrated transport policy and provide a focus
for planning the passenger and freight
railways. The Authority would take over from
OPRAF responsibility for managing the
passenger rail franchises and for administering
the subsidy for passenger services. In addition,
it would:
• plan and promote the use of the railways
within an integrated transport system;
• ensure that the railways are operated as a
coherent network;
• obtain better value for the public subsidy;
• advance the provision of accessible
transport for disabled people.
Railtrack
Railtrack owns and manages the rail
infrastructure in Great Britain. Assets include
32,000 kilometres (20,000 miles) of track;
40,000 bridges, tunnels and viaducts; 2,500
stations; and connections to over 1,000 freight
terminals. Apart from 14 major stations3
operated directly by the company, nearly all'
stations and depots are leased to the train
operating companies. Turnover in 1997—98
totalled £2,467 million, of which 93%
represented payments by passenger and freight
train operators for access to the rail network.
Railtrack intends to invest almost £17,000
million in the rail network in the ten years
from 1998: nearly £8,000 million on renewing
existing infrastructure, £5,500 million on day-
to-day maintenance and £3,100 million on
schemes to enhance the network. Major
projects include modernising the West Coast
Main Line (see p. 369), and the Thameslink
2000 project to improve the capacity of north-
south services through London.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local stopping services; and commuter
3 Eight stations in London—Charing Cross, Euston, Kings
Cross, Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Paddington,
Victoria and Waterloo; and Birmingham New Street,
Edinburgh Waverley, Gatwick, Glasgow Central, Leeds and
Manchester Piccadilly.
368
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
services in and around the large conurbations,
especially London and the South East. About
18,000 scheduled services operate each day.
Some 695 million passenger journeys were
made on the rail network in 1997-98, 7%
more than in 1996-97.
Passenger services (other than Eurostar
services and the Heathrow Express) are run
under franchise by 25 train operating
companies. Bus and coach operator National
Express has the largest number of
franchises—five. Other main operators
include Connex (which is French-owned and
has two franchises running commuter services
in the South East), Virgin, Prism and
Stagecoach. The companies hire their rolling
stock from the three rolling stock companies:
Angel Train Contracts, Forward Trust and
Porterbrook Leasing (a subsidiary of
Stagecoach). BAA runs the Heathrow
Express, which became fully operational in
June 1998 and links Heathrow Airport and
Paddington in central London.
Most franchises last seven years, but some
are for up to 15 years in return for increased
investment commitments. The Government
has indicated that in new and renegotiated
franchises it expects to see more demanding
performance standards for train operators, and
greater accountability to passengers.
Train operating companies are placing
substantial orders for new or refurbished
passenger trains. Virgin Rail is to order 55
new high-speed tilting trains to run at speeds
of up to 140 miles per hour (225 km/h) on
the West Coast Main Line between London
and Glasgow, and 77 high-speed diesel trains
for its cross-country routes.
Freight
There has been a long-term decline in rail
freight traffic, which in 1997 was 105 million
tonnes, 26% less than in 1987, although there
are signs that traffic is now rising. Over 80%
of rail freight traffic by volume is of bulk
commodities, mainly coal, coke, iron and steel,
building materials and petroleum. The
Government is keen to encourage more freight
to be moved by rail, to relieve pressure on the
road network and to bring environmental
benefits. Government grants are available to
encourage companies to move goods by rail or
water rather than by road.
The two largest operators—English, Welsh
& Scottish Railway (EWS), which acquired
most of British Rail’s freight businesses in
1995-96, and Freightliner, which operates
container services between major ports and
inland terminals—are both aiming for
substantial increases in their traffic. EWS has
recently ordered 280 locomotives and over
2,500 wagons, and in May 1998 opened the
first commercial ‘piggyback’ service in the
UK, carrying lorry trailers on specially
designed rail wagons, between Mossend (near
Glasgow) and Willesden in London. A new
£\5 million Freightliner terminal at Westloog,
near Cardiff, is due to open in 1999.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland
Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the
NITHC, operates the railway service on about
336 kilometres (211 miles) of track and
handled over 6 million passenger journeys in
1997—98. The Belfast to Dublin service has
been upgraded, with new track and rolling
stock. Passengers on the route have increased
by nearly 40% since improved services were
introduced in 1997.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel, the largest civil
engineering project in Europe to be financed
by the private sector, was opened to traffic in
1994. It cost about £10,000 million and was
undertaken by Eurotunnel, a British-French
group, under an operating concession from the
British and French governments.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel operates a drive-on, drive-off
shuttle train service, with separate shuttles for
passenger and freight vehicles, between
369
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
terminals near Folkestone and Calais. The
journey takes about 35 minutes. At peak
periods there are up to four passenger shuttle
services and three freight shuttles an hour.
The service has taken about 50% of the
market for tourist vehicles making the crossing
between Kent and northern France.
Eurostar Passenger Services
Up to 32 Eurostar high-speed train services
run daily in each direction through the
Channel Tunnel between London (Waterloo)
and Paris or Brussels, taking less than 3 hours
and 2 hours 40 minutes respectively. Trains
also serve Ashford (Kent), Calais and Lille.
A new high-speed Channel Tunnel Rail
Link is planned between London and the
Channel Tunnel. Following financial
difficulties experienced by London and
Continental Railways (LCR—the consortium
selected to design, build and operate the
Link), in June 1998 the Government and LCR
agreed, together with Railtrack, a Public
Private Partnership refinancing deal. As a
result, Railtrack and Bechtel (of the United
States) will manage the construction on LCR’s
behalf, with Railtrack likely to become owner
of the Link. Extra funding will be provided
for the project, and the Government will
receive about 35% of LCR’s pre-tax surplus
after 2020. LCR’s concession has been
considerably reduced, so that the railway,
including Eurostar, will revert to public
ownership in 2086, at the same time as the
Eurotunnel concession.
Under the new arrangements, the Link will
be built in two stages:
• the first stage, from the Channel Tunnel
to near Ebbsfleet (Kent), will be
completed by 2003 and will then be
acquired by Railtrack; and
• the second stage, from Ebbsfleet to St
Pancras (London), is due for completion
by 2007.
LCR will award the operation of Eurostar
services to a consortium comprising National
Express, British Airways, French Railways
and Belgian Railways.
Channel Tunnel Rail Freight
EWS has acquired British Rail’s Channel
Tunnel freight business, Railfreight
Distribution (RfD), which operates over 150
trains a week to the continent of Europe. RfD
serves terminals at Willesden (London),
Wakefield, Manchester, Mossend (near
Glasgow), Daventry (Northamptonshire) and
Hams Hall (Birmingham), and several
terminals for automotive traffic. All these
terminal facilities allow freight to be
transferred easily between road and rail.
Other Railways in London
London Underground Ltd, a subsidiary of LT,
operates services on 392 kilometres (243 miles)
of railway, of which about 171 kilometres (106
miles) are underground. The system, the oldest
in the world, has 267 stations, with about 480
trains running in the peak period. Around 832
million passenger journeys were made on
London Underground trains in 1997-98. The
main investment project in the Underground is
the £2,760 million extension of the Jubilee Line
to Stratford (east London), which is due to
open in 1999.
In March 1998 the Government
announced a new Public Private
Partnership for the Underground, to tackle
the problems arising from a substantial
backlog of investment. London
Underground will remain in the public
sector and continue to operate the services,
while the private sector will be invited to
undertake a £7,000 million investment
programme over 15 years. Up to three
private sector contracts will be awarded to
maintain and modernise the
Underground’s infrastructure and rolling
stock. Meanwhile, additional government
funding of £365 million will be provided
for investment in the next two years.
The Docklands Light Railway (DLR)
connects Docklands with the City of London,
Beckton and Stratford. Since April 1997 it has
been operated on a seven-year franchise by
Docklands Railway Management Ltd, owned
370
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
by Serco Group pic. An extension of the DLR
to Greenwich and Lewisham is due to open by
January 2000, which will extend the network
to 26 kilometres (16 miles) with 36 stations,
and there are plans for a further extension to
London City Airport by 2004.
The Croydon Tramlink, a new 28-km (18-
mile) light rail network in south London, will
connect Croydon with Wimbledon,
Beckenham and New Addington, running
partly along existing and disused railway track
and partly along or beside roads. It is a joint
undertaking between LT and a private sector
consortium, Tram track Croydon Ltd, which
will build and operate the network. The
network will cost £200 million, with the
DETR providing a grant of £125 million, and
is expected to open in 1999.
Other Railways and Tramways
Three other light rail systems are in operation:
the Tyne and Wear Metro (which carried 35
million passengers in 1997-98), Greater
Manchester Metrolink and South Yorkshire
Supertram. Construction work is in progress
on an extension of the Manchester Metrolink
to Eccles via Salford Quays and on Midland
Metro Line One in Birmingham. There are
proposals for many more light rail schemes,
and statutory powers have been obtained for
further extensions of the Manchester
Metrolink and to build the Leeds Supertram
and the Nottingham Express Transit system.
The Glasgow Underground, a heavy rapid
transit system, operates on a 10-km (6-mile)
loop in central Glasgow. Traditional trams
still operate in Blackpool and Llandudno.
Over 100 other passenger-carrying
railways, many concerned with the
preservation of steam locomotives, are to be
found throughout Great Britain. Most are
operated on a voluntary basis and provide
limited services for tourists and railway
enthusiasts. They generally run on former
branch lines, but there are also several narrow-
gauge lines, mainly in north Wales.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are popular for leisure and
recreation, and make a valuable contribution
to the quality of the UK’s environment. They
also play a significant role in land drainage and
water supply, and some are used for carrying
freight. The greatest amounts of seagoing
freight are carried on the Rivers Thames,
Forth, Humber and Mersey and the
Manchester Ship Canal. The most important
waterways for internal traffic are the Thames,
the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Mersey
and the Manchester Ship Canal.
British Waterways is responsible for 3,200
kilometres (2,000 miles) of waterways in Great
Britain, making up the greater part of the
canal system. Most are primarily for leisure
use, but about 620 kilometres (385 miles) are
maintained as commercial waterways.
Relatively little use of inland waterways is
made for passenger transport in the UK.
However, the DETR has launched the
Thames 2000 initiative, with the aim of using
river services to the Millennium celebrations
at Greenwich (see p. 355) to revitalise
passenger transport on the Thames. Over £6
million will be invested in new vessels by boat
operators who will run four new services on
the Thames, while £15 million will be spent
on new and upgraded piers.
British Waterways, in partnership with a
consortium of public sector and voluntary
bodies, is undertaking the Millennium
Link Canal project for the restoration of
two major canals in central Scotland: the
Forth and Clyde Canal and the Union
Canal. A grant of £32 million is being
provided by the Millennium Commission
towards the total cost of £78 million.
SHIPPING
The UK merchant fleet has declined in recent
years. During 1997 the number of UK-owned
merchant trading ships of 100 gross tonnes or
more fell from 638 to 612. Their total tonnage
was 10.6 million deadweight tonnes. This
comprised 154 vessels totalling 5.1 million
deadweight tonnes used as oil, chemical or gas
carriers, and 458 vessels totalling 5.5 million
deadweight tonnes employed as dry-bulk
371
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
carriers, container ships or other types of
cargo ship. In all, 71% of UK-owned vessels
are registered in the UK or British Overseas
Territories such as Bermuda.
The Government’s shipping policy aims to
foster the growth of an efficient UK-owned
merchant fleet, encourage UK ship
registration and promote the employment and
training of seafarers. In consultation with
shipping interests, it is looking at ways of
reviving the sector and developing the
economic potential. A Shipping Working
Group is considering how to obtain the
maximum national economic and
environmental benefits for shipping. A new
seafarers’ training scheme, Support for
Maritime Training, was introduced in April
1998. The system of government grants to
encourage the carriage of freight by rail and
water instead of road is to be extended to
cover coastal and short-sea shipping.
Cargo Services
About 95% by weight (75% by value) of the
UK’s foreign trade is carried by sea.
International revenue earned by the UK
shipping industry in 1997 was £3,948 million:
£2,925 million from freight—£2,253 million
on dry cargo and passenger vessels and £672
million on tankers and liquefied gas carriers—
£299 million from charter receipts and £724
million from passenger revenue.
Nearly all scheduled cargo-liner services
from the UK are containerised. British
tonnage serving these trades is dominated by a
relatively small number of private sector
companies. P&O Nedlloyd (owned by P&O
and Royal Nedlloyd of the Netherlands) is
among the three largest container carriers in
the world. In deep-sea trades, shipping
companies usually operate in conjunction with
other companies on the same routes under
arrangements such as conferences or alliances,
with the aim of ensuring the provision of
regular and efficient services with stable
freight rates, to the benefit of both shipper
and shipowner. Besides the carriage of freight
by liner and bulk services between the UK
and the rest of Europe, many roll on roll off
services carry cars, passengers and commercial
vehicles.
Passenger Services
In 1997, 36 million international sea passenger
movements took place between the UK and
the rest of the world, compared with about
114 million international air passenger
movements. Almost all the passengers who
arrived at or departed from UK ports travelled
to or from the continent of Europe or the Irish
Republic. Traffic from southern and south¬
eastern ports accounts for a large proportion
of traffic to the continent.
P&O European Ferries is the largest ferry
operator in north-west Europe, with a fleet of
51 ships operating on 22 routes around the
UK. In March 1998 its cross-Channel
operations at Dover and Newhaven were
merged with those of Stena Line to form P&O
Stena Line. Cross-Channel services are
operated by roll on roll off ferries, hovercraft
(run by Hoverspeed) and high-speed
catamarans.
Domestic passenger and freight ferry
services also run to many of the offshore islands,
such as the Isle of Wight, Orkney and Shetland,
and the islands off the west coast of Scotland.
P&O Cruises Ltd is one of the three
leading cruise operators in the world. In
1998 Princess Cruises (a US subsidiary of
P&O) took delivery of the world’s largest
cruise ship, the 109,000-tonne Grand
Princess.
Maritime Safety
The DETR’s policies for improving marine
safety and pollution control are implemented
by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency
(MCA), formed in April 1998 by the merger
of the Coastguard Agency and the Marine
Safety Agency. The MCA carries out
inspections on UK ships and foreign ships
using UK ports to ensure that they comply
with international safety, pollution prevention
and operational standards. In 1997, 156
overseas-registered ships were detained in UK
ports. In July 1998 new regulations
implemented in the UK the International
Safety Management Code, which encourages
safety, both ashore and on board ships.
372
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
In 1997 HM Coastguard co-ordinated
action in almost 11,700 incidents (including
cliff rescues), in which nearly 16,900 people
were helped. In an emergency it co-ordinates
facilities, such as its own helicopters; cliff
rescue companies; lifeboats of the Royal
National Lifeboat Institution (a voluntary
body); aircraft, helicopters and ships from the
armed forces; and merchant shipping and
commercial aircraft.
Some locations around the UK are
potentially hazardous for shipping. Measures
to reduce the risk of collision include the
separation of ships into internationally agreed
shipping lanes, as applies in the Dover Strait,
one of the world’s busiest seaways, which is
monitored by radar from the Channel
Navigation Information Service near Dover.
There are over 1,000 marine aids to navigation
around the UK coast and responsibility for
these rests with the general lighthouse
authorities: Trinity House Lighthouse Service
(for England and Wales), the Northern
Lighthouse Board (for Scotland and the Isle of
Man) and the Commissioners of Irish Lights
(which covers the whole of Ireland). The
UK’s last manned lighthouse, at North
Foreland (Kent), will become automatic in
November 1998.
Since the loss of the Herald of Free
Enterprise in 1987, the UK has played a key
role in securing safety improvements for roll
on roll off ferries. Following the loss of the
Estonia in 1994, the UK was instrumental in
securing the Stockholm Agreement in 1996 to
apply a higher stability standard to ferries
operating on international routes in north¬
west Europe and the Baltic Sea. In June 1998 a
new EC directive was agreed, which will
require roll on roll off ferries to undergo safety
checks before entering service and to carry
voyage data recorders (‘black boxes’).
PORTS
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, while several
hundred small harbours cater for local cargo,
fishing vessels, island ferries or recreation.
There are three broad types of port: over 90
trust ports owned and run by boards
constituted as trusts; those owned by local
authorities (predominantly small ports, but
including a few larger ones, such as
Portsmouth); and company-owned facilities.
Major ports controlled by trusts include
Aberdeen, Dover, Milford Haven and Tyne.
The Government is considering the future
status and role of trust ports in Great Britain.
Following a review of trust ports in Northern
Ireland, the Government announced in May
1998 that the port of Belfast would be
transferred to the private sector through a
Public Private Partnership.
Associated British Ports (ABP) is the UK’s
largest port owner and operates 23 ports,
including Cardiff, Grimsby and Immingham,
Hull, Ipswich, Newport, Southampton and
Swansea. Altogether they handled 121 million
tonnes of cargo in 1997 when ABP invested
£73 million in its ports and transport business.
Other major facilities owned by private sector
companies include Felixstowe, Harwich and
Thamesport (all owned by the Hong Kong
group Hutchison Whampoa), Clyde, Forth,
Liverpool, Medway and Manchester.
Port Traffic
In 1997 traffic through major UK ports
amounted to 559 million tonnes: 179 million
tonnes of exports, 206 million tonnes of
imports and 173 million tonnes of domestic
traffic (which included offshore traffic and
landings of sea-dredged aggregates). Minor
ports handled an additional 37 million tonnes.
The UK’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are shown in Table 22.3.
Forth, Milford Haven and Sullom Voe
(Shetland) mostly handle oil, while the
principal destinations for non-fuel traffic are
London, Felixstowe, Grimsby and
Immingham, Tees and Hartlepool, and Dover.
Container and roll on roll off traffic in the
UK was 123 million tonnes in 1997 and now
accounts for 84% of non-bulk traffic. The
most important ports for container traffic are
Felixstowe, Southampton and London. Dover
is the leading port for roll on roll off traffic. It
is also the major arrival and departure point,
handling around half of international sea
passenger movements to and from the UK.
Northern Ireland has four main ports, at
Belfast, Larne, Londonderry and
373

CIVIL AVIATION
UK airlines are entirely in the private sector,
as are many of the major airports. Air traffic is
continuing to grow rapidly. In 1997 UK
airlines flew a record 1,187 million aircraft
kilometres, 68% higher than in 1987: 809
million kilometres on scheduled services and
378 million kilometres on non-scheduled
flights. They carried 56 million passengers on
scheduled services and 28 million on charter
flights. Passenger seat occupancy was 78%,
being much higher on charter flights (90%)
than on scheduled services (72%). It is also
higher for international flights (78%) than
internal services (64%).
The Government aims to create an
innovative climate in which both new and
established airlines can compete equally to
offer services to meet the needs of consumers.
It intends to achieve further liberalisation of
international air services in bilateral
negotiations with other countries, for example,
on transatlantic routes. A new policy on
airports, covering the next 30 years, is being
prepared. In June 1998 the Government
announced proposals to encourage
international flights to use regional airports by
offering open access to all UK airports, except
Heathrow and Gatwick, to airlines from
countries with which the UK has bilateral
agreements, provided that UK airlines are
allowed to operate on the same routes.
Day-to-day responsibility for the regulation
of civil aviation rests with the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA).
Airlines
British Airways
British Airways is the eighth largest carrier in
terms of passengers carried, and the world’s
largest international airline. During 1997—98
its turnover from airline operations was
£8,600 million. The British Airways group,
which employs over 55,000 people worldwide,
carried 40.9 million passengers on scheduled
flights, both within the UK and
internationally, in 1997—98.
The airline’s scheduled route network
serves 164 destinations in 83 countries. Its
main operating base is London’s Heathrow
Airport, with services also operational from
Gatwick and regional centres such as
Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester. The
airline has a fleet of 291 aircraft, one of the
largest in Western Europe, including seven
Concordes, 78 Boeing 747s, 67 Boeing 737s,
51 Boeing 757s, 28 Boeing 767s and 19 Boeing
777s. In August 1998 British Airways
announced its intention to acquire up to 220
new aircraft, including up to 188 Airbus
regional jets; firm orders were placed for 59
Airbus aircraft and 16 Boeing 777s.
374
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Other Airlines
Other major UK airlines operating
internationally include:
• Air UK;
• Britannia Airways, the world’s biggest
charter airline, which carried 7.6 million
passengers in 1997 and has 27 aircraft;
• British Midland, which operates a large
network of scheduled services with 33
aircraft and carried 5.8 million passengers
in 1997;
• Monarch Airlines; and
• Virgin Atlantic, which has scheduled
services to 12 overseas destinations.
Airports
Of over 140 licensed civil aerodromes in the
UK, nearly one-quarter handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. In 1997 the
UK’s civil airports handled a total of 132.2
million passengers (130.8 million terminal
passengers and 1.4 million in transit), and 1.9
million tonnes of freight.
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international travellers and is the UK’s most
important for passengers and air freight,
handling 58.2 million passengers (including
those in transit) and 1.2 million tonnes of
freight in 1997. Gatwick is also one of the
world’s busiest international airports.
Liberalisation of airline services in the EU
has brought a noticeable increase in
competition, according to a report by the
CAA in June 1998. New operators have
started services, and the market share of
national carriers in EU domestic markets
fell from 75% in 1993 to 60% at the end of
1997. A feature has been the growth of
low-fare, ‘no frills’ airlines, including, in
the UK, Easyjet, Debonair and the British
Airways subsidiary Go (which began
flights in May 1998).
Ownership and Control
BAA pic, which was privatised in 1987, is the
world’s largest commercial operator of
airports. In the UK it owns and operates seven
airports—Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and
Southampton in southern England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in
Scotland—which handle about 70% of the
UK’s air passenger traffic and 82% of air
cargo. Overseas, it manages Indianapolis and
Harrisburg airports in the United States, and
Naples Airport in Italy, and is a member of a
consortium which owns and manages

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Melbourne and Launceston airports in
Australia. It also manages commercial facilities
at its airports, and is now the world’s second
largest duty-free retailer.
Other airports controlled by companies
include Belfast International and Cardiff,
which are owned by TBI; and East Midlands,
which is run by National Express.
Manchester, Luton and Newcastle airports are
among those owned by local authorities.
All UK airports used for public transport
and training flights must be licensed by the
CAA for reasons of safety. Stringent
requirements, such as the provision of
adequate fire-fighting, medical and rescue
services, have to be satisfied before a licence is
granted. Strict security measures are in force
at UK terminals. Regulations require airlines
to account for, and authorise for carriage,
every item of hold baggage placed on board
international flights originating in the UK.
Airport Development
At Heathrow, current developments include a
£38 million extension at Terminal 2, while
connections to the airport have been
improved following the opening of the £450
million Heathrow Express rail link to central
London (see p. 369). A planning inquiry is
being held into a proposed fifth terminal at
Heathrow, which could eventually cater for
30 million passengers a year. Large-scale
improvements are in progress at other
airports, including:
• a £54 million project to redesign
completely the terminal at Edinburgh
Airport and provide a 46-desk check-in
hall, a new departure lounge, a fully
automated baggage sorting system and
other modern facilities—the first phase
will open in mid-1999 and the terminal
will be complete in spring 2000;
• a second runway at Manchester Airport,
the first full-length runway to be built in
the UK for 20 years, which is expected to
open in 2000;
• a £37 million investment programme to
provide a new terminal at Bristol Airport
by early 2000; and
• a £27 million scheme to double the size
of the terminal at Newcastle Airport.
Air Traffic Control
Civil and military air traffic control over the
UK and the surrounding seas, including much
of the North Atlantic, is undertaken by
National Air Traffic Services Ltd (NATS, a
subsidiary of the CAA), working in
collaboration with military controllers. Air
traffic control facilities not only have to deal
with the continuing growth in air traffic, but
also have to ensure that delays to airlines are
minimised. In 1997 the average delay to
scheduled services was 16 minutes and to
charter services 37 minutes. All civil and
military en route air traffic control operations
in the UK will eventually be concentrated at
two sites:
• a new air traffic control centre, at
Swanwick (Hampshire), which will
handle traffic over England and Wales;
and
• a new Scottish centre at Prestwick, which
will handle traffic over Scotland and
Northern Ireland and replace the existing
Prestwick centre.
The Government has decided that the
future operation of NATS will be best served
through a new Public Private Partnership to
help finance further investment and improve
passenger safety. It is examining the future
organisation of NATS, based on its preference
for a majority stake to be sold to private
investors, including employees, and intends
that air safety regulation will be conducted
separately from NATS.
Air Safety
The CAA imposes very high safety standards
on UK airlines, which ensures they have a
good safety record. It certifies aircraft and air
crews, licenses air operators and air travel
organisers, and approves certain air fares and
airport charges. To qualify for a first
professional licence, a pilot must undertake a
full-time course of instruction approved by
the CAA—or have acceptable military or
376
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
civilian flying experience—and pass ground
examinations and flight tests. Every company
operating aircraft used for commercial air
transport purposes must possess an Air
Operator’s Certificate, which the CAA grants
when it is satisfied that the company is
competent to operate its aircraft safely. All
aircraft registered in the UK must be granted
a certificate of airworthiness by the CAA
before being flown.
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the CAA
works closely with the Joint Aviation
Authorities (JAA), a European grouping of
aviation safety regulation authorities. The
Government supports the proposal to
establish a new European Aviation Safety
Authority, which would build on the work of
the JAA.
The DETR’s Air Accidents Investigation
Branch is responsible for investigating
accidents and serious incidents occurring in
UK airspace and those that happen overseas to
aircraft registered or manufactured in the UK.
In 1997 it investigated 322 accidents and
serious incidents in the UK, and participated
in six accident investigations overseas.
Communications
Telecommunications is one of the most
rapidly expanding sectors of the UK economy.
Growth has been particularly strong in new
services, such as those provided over the
Internet—there are an estimated 7 million
Internet or on-line users in the UK. A report
for the Department of Trade and Industry in
1998 found that business use of the Internet
grew by 40% in 1997; 37% of UK companies
have their own website; 63% use electronic
mail; and usage of e-mail is rising by over 20%
a year. Postal services remain important, and
the volume of conventional mail continues to
increase.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
The UK was one of the first countries
to introduce competition in its
telecommunications network, when British
Telecom (BT) became a private sector
company in 1984. Britain now has one of the
world’s most open telecommunications
markets, with nearly 400 licences issued to
more than 300 different providers. Full
liberalisation of telecommunications services
and networks in the EU took effect at the
beginning of 1998, and the World Trade
Organisation agreement on trade in
telecommunications services (see p. 407),
concluded in 1997, is expected to facilitate
further rapid expansion in services worldwide.
Services
Effective competition exists in most large
urban areas of the UK, as new fixed link
operators have extended their networks,
resulting in a wider choice of supplier for
users and lower prices. Competitors to BT
have increased their share of the market,
especially the business market (see Table
22.5). Cable companies now have 21% of the
business market in international calls and
other companies 42%, with BT’s share 37%.
Other licences awarded include three to run
national digital broadband services and two to
serve remote rural areas.
Telephone traffic has been rising quickly,
with calls from fixed links growing by 9% a
year, stimulated by price cuts and greater
marketing by operators. International calls in
particular are growing rapidly, by around 20%
a year. Exchange lines are continuing to
increase, with business exchange lines rising at
a faster rate than residential lines. BT still has
a relatively high proportion of exchange
lines—87% of residential lines and nearly
90% of business lines. However, cable
operators are gaining customers in the
residential market and among small
businesses. Mobile telephone usage is also
increasing rapidly, and the number of
subscribers has reached around 10 million.
Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL)
OFTEL, a non-ministerial government
department, is the independent regulatory
body for the telecommunications industry. It
is headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, whose functions
include:

• ensuring that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• promoting effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• providing advice to the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry on
telecommunications matters; and
• investigating complaints against public
telecommunications operators.
Rapid developments in the
telecommunications sector are changing the
emphasis of OFTEL’s work. It is moving
away from detailed regulation in basic
domestic telecommunications services and
looking to ensure that competition applies in
international and mobile services, and to
consider the effects of the convergence of the
telecommunications and broadcasting sectors.
The Government is reviewing the future
regulation of broadcasting and
telecommunications, taking account of the
implications of this convergence (see p. 273).
Service Providers
BT
BT was the UK’s second largest company in
summer 1998 in terms of market
capitalisation. It is the UK’s biggest
telecommunications company and runs one of
the world’s largest public telecommunications
networks, including over 20 million residential
lines and more than 7 million business lines
(see Table 22.5). It has 7,500 local telephone
exchanges and 69 main switching units, and
over 138,000 public payphones, and employs
124,700 people. It operates a wide range of
specialised services, and BT Internet is one of
378
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
the largest UK Internet service providers. In
1998 it launched British Interactive
Broadcasting—a joint venture with BSkyB,
Midland Bank and Matsushita—to offer
interactive services, such as home shopping, to
television viewers.
BT has extensive international interests
through its ‘Concert’ operation. Concert
Communications Services has 3,800 major
corporate customers in over 50 countries. In
July 1998 BT and AT&T (one of the largest
telecommunications companies in the United
States) announced their intention to create,
subject to regulatory approval, a joint venture
combining their international assets, network
and traffic (including the Concert services).
This would serve 237 countries and
territories, and have annual revenue of over
US $10,000 million.
Cable & Wireless
Cable & Wireless pic supplies a wide range of
telecommunications services in over 50
countries and employs over 46,000 people. Its
main business is the provision and operation
of public telecommunications services in more
than 30 countries and territories, under
franchises and licences granted by the
governments concerned. Around 39% of the
group’s turnover of £8,302 million in 1997-98
came from its interests in Hong Kong. It is the
third biggest carrier of international traffic.
Its fleet of 13 cableships and 21 submersible
vehicle systems for laying and maintaining
submarine telecommunications cables is the
largest in the world.
In September 1998 Cable & Wireless
achieved a significant increase in its
presence in the United States, when it
acquired the Internet assets of the US
telecommunications company MCI for
about £1,100 million, bringing it one of
the world’s major Internet networks and
a leading position in the US Internet
market.
In the UK Cable & Wireless pic has a 53%
stake in Cable & Wireless Communications,
the largest integrated communications
supplier in the UK offering a broad range of
telecommunications, information and
entertainment services. Cable & Wireless
Communications has around 9% of the UK’s
telecommunications market and services about
1.6 million telecommunications customers,
798,000 cable television customers and over
130,000 businesses. Cable & Wireless
Communications will launch interactive
services and high-speed Internet access
through the television during 1999, alongside
its digital cable television services.
Other Operators
Other public telecommunications operators
include:
• COLT Telecom, which has high-
capacity optical fibre networks in nine
major European cities, and is planning to
increase this to 26 in the next two years;
• Energis, which is concentrating on
enhanced voice and advanced data
services, with a network of over 5,000
kilometres (3,000 miles) across the
National Grid electricity transmission
infrastructure—in April 1998 it set up a
joint venture with Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom to establish
MetroHoldings Ltd, which will invest
£100 million to expand the network
across London and other metropolitan
centres in the UK;
• Kingston Communications, the long-
established network operator for the
Kingston upon Hull area in Yorkshire;
• ScottishTelecom (a division of
ScottishPower), which is expanding its
telecommunications network in Scotland
and in May 1998 acquired Demon (then
the UK’s largest independent Internet
service provider); and
• Vodafone, the biggest mobile operator,
which also has a licence for fixed services.
Recently there has been a substantial
consolidation among the cable operators. The
three main operators are now Cable &
Wireless Communications, Telewest and
NTL. By the end of 1997 cable operators had
installed around 3.5 million telephone lines in
379
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
the UK, and 10 million homes were able to
receive broadband cable services.
Mobile Communications
The UK has been at the forefront of
developing mobile telecommunications in
Europe. Around 17% of people in the UK
have a mobile telephone. Vodafone and
Cellnet are the two largest operators, with 3.7
million and 3.2 million subscribers
respectively.
The UK was the first country to offer
personal communications network (PCN)
digital services. The two PCN operators are
Orange, with 1.5 million customers, and One-
2-One (owned by Cable & Wireless and
MediaOne International), with almost 1.5
million subscribers. The Government intends
that the UK will be the first country in
Europe to introduce licensing arrangements
for the third generation of mobile telephones,
which will provide high-speed access to a large
number of entertainment and information
services.
Dolphin Telecommunications has been
licensed to run a mobile telephone network
using the TETRA technology, which
enhances the variety and quality of available
services, including advanced speech and data
facilities, and greater security.
Other licences awarded include four to
operate national paging networks and four to
run mobile data networks.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail. Today, Royal Mail delivers
to 26 million addresses in the UK, handling 75
million letters each working day. In 1997-98 it
processed 18,430 million inland letters and
836 million international letters (excluding
those from overseas). The Post Office’s
Parcelforce Worldwide operation handles over
140 million items a year. Mail is collected
from 112,000 posting boxes, and from post
offices and large postal users. The Post Office
employs almost 200,000 people.
The Government plans to give the Post
Office greater commercial freedom, so that it
can take advantage of new opportunities and
reach its full potential, and has commissioned
a review of the options, on the basis that the
Post Office will remain in the public sector.
The conclusions are expected to be announced
in autumn 1998.
Royal Mail has invested substantially in the
latest mail-sorting technology. New high¬
speed mail-handling machinery—the
Integrated Mail Processor—was introduced in
1997 and should enable automatic handling of
90% of letter mail by 2000. Automatic sorting
utilises the information contained in the
postcode; the UK postcode system is one of
the most sophisticated in the world, allowing
mechanised sorting down to part of a street on
a postman’s round and, in some cases, to an
individual address. Royal Mail has invested
£150 million in new high-speed mail trains,
with eight terminals, including a new road-rail
interchange in north London, while
Parcelforce Worldwide is investing over £100
million in a new distribution centre at
Coventry Airport.
Royal Mail International has its own mail¬
handling centre at Heathrow, which handles
about four-fifths of outward airmail. It uses
1,400 flights a week to send mail direct to over
300 destinations worldwide.
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions, with a total value of
£147,725 million in 1997-98. It acts as an
agent for Royal Mail and Parcelforce
Worldwide, government departments, local
authorities and Alliance & Leicester Giro
banking services. There are about 19,000 post
offices in the UK, of which around 600 are
operated directly by the Post Office. The
remainder are franchise offices or are operated
on an agency basis by sub-postmasters.
Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office offers a variety of specialist
services. Parcelforce Worldwide provides a
door-to-door overnight delivery service
throughout the UK and an international
service to 239 countries and territories.
‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a rapid delivery
within or between major UK cities. The
380
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh is an
important outlet for the Post Office’s
philatelic (postage stamp) business, including
sales to overseas collectors or dealers. The
British Postal Consultancy Service offers
advice and assistance on all aspects of postal
business to overseas postal administrations,
and over 50 countries have used its services
since 1965.
Private Courier and Express Services
Private sector couriers and express operators
are allowed to handle time-sensitive door-to-
door deliveries, subject to a minimum fee of
£1. The courier/express service industry has
grown rapidly and the annual revenue earned
by the carriage of these items is estimated at
about £2,000 million. The UK is a major
provider of monitored express deliveries in
Europe, with London one of the main centres
for air courier/express traffic; there are
around 45 operators.

The UK economy has recently experienced economic growth combined with low
inflation and falling unemployment. In 1997 it achieved the first surplus on the
current account of the balance of payments since 1985. Nevertheless, the
economy continues to face problems, such as low levels of investment and
productivity, and income per head is below that of many other major
industrialised nations. The Government’s economic policies are directed towards
the achievement of high and stable levels of growth and employment, enabling
everyone to share in higher living standards and greater job opportunities. Extra
resources are being allocated to priority concerns, notably health, education,
public transport, and the regeneration of urban areas and housing.

THE ECONOMY
The value of all goods and services produced in
the economy is measured by gross domestic
product (GDP). In 1997 GDP at current
market prices totalled £801,972 million.
Between 1987 and 1997 GDP at constant prices
increased by 24%. Statistics for GDP and some
of the main components are shown in Table
23.1. These are taken from the Office for
National Statistics United Kingdom National
Accounts 1998—the Blue Book. The 1998 edition
is the first to be produced under the European
System of Accounts 1995, which is based on the
internationally agreed System of National
Accounts 1993 now being adopted worldwide.

indicators are shown in the charts on p. 383.
Output
Long-term economic growth in the UK has
averaged around 2.25% a year. However, over
the past 25 years the UK has experienced
lower economic growth than any of its major
competitors. The recession of the early 1990s
was followed by a recovery in output from the
second half of 1992. Following an increase of
4.4% in 1994, GDP grew at an annual rate of
2%-2.5% in the second half of 1995 and for
most of 1996. Growth in GDP accelerated
again at the beginning of 1997, reflecting
stronger consumer spending and a recovery in
investment. In 1997 GDP grew by 3.5%.
Growth has slowed during 1998, with a slower
rise in domestic demand—under the influence
of tighter monetary and fiscal policy—and a
negative contribution to overall growth from
net trade, reflecting the effect of the
appreciation of sterling since summer 1996 on
the volume of trade. In the second quarter of
1998 GDP was 3.0% higher than a year earlier.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the services sector (see
chapter 30), which now accounts for around

two-thirds of GDP, compared with about a
half in 1950. Oil and gas production has had a
major impact on the UK economy since
substantial production of gas started in the late
1960s and oil began to be produced in
significant quantities in 1976. Manufacturing
(see chapter 28) now contributes less than a
quarter of GDP, compared with over a third
in 1950.
During the 1990s, services industries’
output has been on an upward trend, with
only a minor drop during 1991 and 1992, and
output grew by 4.6% in 1997. In the second
quarter of 1998 it was 3.8% higher than a year
earlier, with particularly strong growth in
transport, storage and communications (of
7.3%) and business services and finance
(5.8%). Manufacturing growth has generally
been well below that of services. In 1997
manufacturing output rose by 1.0%, and in
the second quarter of 1998 was 0.7% higher
than a year earlier.
Productivity
The level of productivity in the UK has been
lower than in many other industrialised
countries, partly reflecting lower levels of

the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) show a
productivity gap between the UK and the
United States of about 40%, with a gap of
20% with France and Germany.
Investment
In recent decades the UK has invested a
smaller share of GDP than other
industrialised countries—around 18% of
GDP, compared with the OECD average of
almost 21%. This has left a legacy of low
capital stock per worker. Following growth of
around 4% a year in the 1980s, investment in
the UK declined during the recession of the
early 1990s. However, in 1997 investment
(gross fixed capital formation) at constant
1995 prices increased by 6.1%, the fastest rate
of growth since 1988. Business investment
rose by 8.8%, with private sector investment
in dwellings up by 7%, although investment
by general government fell by 9.1%. During
the second quarter of 1998 overall investment
at 1995 prices was 5.7% higher than a year
earlier, with a stronger rise in business
investment (7.1%) and a sharp rise in
investment by general government (of 26.1%).
Business investment has been helped by the
high level of inward investment (see p. 409).
In recent years, the UK has received the
greatest share of inward investment into the
European Union, including over 40% of
Japanese investment and about 40% of US
investment.
Income and Expenditure
Households’ final consumption expenditure
accounted for 7 5% of total final consumption
expenditure in 1997, and amounted to
£500,616 million at current market prices. In
terms of constant prices, it rose by 4.4% in
1997, well above the long-term average and
the highest rate of increase in the 1990s.

Households’ spending on durable goods was
up by 10% in 1997. The growth in
households’ expenditure reflected rising
income and wealth, with a contribution of
around £35,000 million coming from
‘windfall’ payments received by households
from the flotation of a number of building
societies and insurance companies (see chapter
30). In the second quarter of 1998 households’
final consumption expenditure was 2.8%
higher than a year earlier, with a higher rate of
growth in financial services (6.2%) and
durable goods (5.9%), although there were
falls in expenditure in real terms on alcohol
and tobacco and on energy products.
Table 23.4 shows the changing pattern of
households’ final consumption expenditure.
Over the longer term, as incomes rise, people
tend to spend increasing proportions of their
disposable income on durable goods and
certain services. Spending on leisure pursuits
and tourism, communications, health and
financial services have all shown significant
growth in recent years. Declining proportions
are being spent on food and alcoholic drink,
tobacco, and fuel and power.
Total resources of the households’ sector
(including non-profit institutions serving
households) rose by 5.4% in 1997 to £789,736
million. Gross disposable income—after
deductions, including taxes on incomes and
other current taxes (£91,062 million) and
social contributions (£125,525 million)—
totalled £553,326 million. In real terms,
households’ disposable income rose by 3.5%
in 1997. Growth was helped by a rapid rise in
property income over the past three years,
especially company dividend receipts, and the
buoyant stock market in 1997 contributed to a
24% increase in the sector’s net financial
wealth during the year, to £1,923,000 million.
In 1997, 90.5% of after-tax household
income was spent and 9.5% saved. There was
a notable fall in the household saving ratio in
the first quarter of 1998, to 6.8%, although it
rose to 7.8% in the second quarter. Wages and
salaries accounted for nearly 59% of
household primary income in 1997.
Inflation
The two main measures of retail price
inflation used in the UK are:
• the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which
records the price of goods and services
purchased by households in the UK and
is used to calculate what is often referred
to as ‘headline’ inflation; and
• the RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments (RPIX), which is used to
calculate ‘underlying’ inflation and is the
target measure used by the Government
(see p. 387).
Underlying annual inflation in the last 20
years has fluctuated considerably, with a peak
of 16.9% in 1980. However, it has been much

lower in the 1990s, and since 1993 it has been
held in a relatively narrow range, from
2%-3.5%. The annual rate of the RPI
excluding mortgage interest payments was
2.5% in September 1998, and the headline
inflation rate was 3.2%. The appreciation in
sterling since summer 1996 and relatively low
world commodity prices, such as for oil, have
helped to lower inflation. This is reflected in
the sharp fall in input prices for materials and
fuel purchased by manufacturing industry,
which were down by 10% in the year to
September 1998.
Output price inflation has also remained
low, with prices of manufactured products in
the UK rising by just 0.3% in the year to
September 1998. Retail price inflation did not
fall back as far as producer prices during 1997
or the first half of 1998 as retailers appear to
have expanded domestic margins against a
background of strong domestic demand.
Another measure of inflation is the
harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP),
which is calculated in each EU member state
for the purposes of international comparison.
In the year to August 1998 the HICP for the
UK was 1.3%. During most of 1998 the UK’s
HICP has been slightly above the EU average.
Labour Market
Unemployment in the UK has fallen in recent
years and is below that in many other
European countries. In the three months to
August 1998, unemployment, according to the
International Labour Organisation measure,
was 1.8 million, some 226,000 fewer than a
year earlier, and this represented 6.3% of the
workforce. Employment in this period rose by
around 307,000 to 27.2 million (see chapter
11), and has now recovered to the level at the
beginning of the 1990s.
386
ECONOMY AND PUBLIC FINANCE
Overseas Trade
International trade plays a key role in the UK
economy (see chapter 24). Exports of goods
and services accounted for 29% of GDP in
1997 and earnings from direct overseas
investments were a record £32,715 million.
Membership of the European Union has
had a major impact on the UK’s pattern of
trade. Between 1972—the year before the UK
became a member—and 1997 the proportion
of its exports of goods going to other EU
members rose from 40% to 56%, while other
EU countries supplied 55% of the UK’s
imports of goods in 1997.
In 1997 the UK had a surplus on the
current account (see p. 405) of £8,006 million,
the first annual surplus since 1985. Record
surpluses were achieved on trade in services
(£11,160 million) and on investment income
(£12,085 million), and there was a reduction
in the deficit on trade in goods, to £11,792
million. The volume of exports of goods and
services grew by 8% in 1997, partly reflecting
a sharp recovery in world trade growth.
However, UK trade has been affected by the
strength of sterling—which had at its peak
appreciated by over 28% since August 1996
(although it has been falling back in recent
months)—and the effects of the financial crisis
in Asia, which have hit UK exports to the area
and led to UK exporters facing growing
competition in the domestic market. In the
three months to July 1998 the value of exports
of goods excluding oil was 3.6% lower than a
year earlier, although exports of services
continued to rise, up by 9.6% during this
period.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The Government is implementing a set of
economic policies designed to improve the
underlying rate of growth and employment. It
is seeking to:
• ensure economic stability, based on low
inflation and sound public finances;
• encourage work and raise productivity;
and
• create a fairer society, through fairness in
taxation (see p. 393) and spending (see
p. 388).
HM Treasury is the department with
prime responsibility for the Government’s
monetary and fiscal frameworks. It is also
responsible for economic policy, which it
carries out in conjunction with other
government departments, such as Trade and
Industry; Education and Employment; and
the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
Economic Stability
The Government considers that economic
stability is vital for the achievement of its
central economic objective of high and stable
levels of growth and employment. It has
introduced new frameworks for both monetary
and fiscal policy to ensure low inflation and
sound public finances.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC, see p. 513) is responsible
for setting interest rates to meet the
Government’s inflation target of 2.5%, as
defined by the 12-month increase in the RPI
excluding mortgage interest payments. This
new framework has put monetary policy on a
long-term footing, and is one of the most
transparent and accountable in the world.
Between May 1997 and June 1998 short¬
term interest rates were raised from 6% to
7.5% to offset incipient inflationary pressures.
At its October 1998 meeting the MPC voted
to cut the rate to 7.25%.
During 1998 the world economy has been
affected by exceptional movements in
financial markets, which initially occurred
in parts of Asia but then spread to other
regions, such as Russia and Latin America.
The International Monetary Fund has
reduced its forecast for growth in the
world economy in 1998 to 2% (from
4.25%). The UK Government is playing a
full part in addressing the difficulties in
the global economy, to maintain prosperity
and to prevent and resolve crises. It has
put forward proposals for reforming the
architecture of the world’s financial
system.
387
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy is guided by two strict rules:
• the golden rule—over the economic cycle
the Government will borrow only to
invest and not to fund current spending;
and
• the sustainable investment rule—net
public debt as a proportion of GDP will
be held over the economic cycle at a
stable and prudent level.
These rules mean that current taxpayers pay
for current spending and require public
borrowing to be kept under firm control.
The Finance Act 1998 established a new
Code for Fiscal Stability, which requires
fiscal and debt management policy to be
carried out in accordance with five key
principles:
• transparency in setting fiscal policy
objectives, the implementation of
fiscal policy and the publication of the
public accounts;
• stability in the fiscal policy-making
process and in the way that fiscal
policy affects the economy;
• responsibility in the management of
the public finances;
• fairness, including between
generations; and
• efficiency in the design and
implementation of fiscal policy, and
in managing both sides of the public
sector balance sheet.
The framework is being strengthened by a
new way of controlling public expenditure
(see p. 391).
Encouraging Work and Raising
Productivity
The Government is pursuing policies to
expand employment opportunities and ensure
that work is appropriately rewarded; a number
of measures to this effect were announced in
the March 1998 Budget (see p. 394). It also
wishes to see higher levels of productivity and
to raise skill levels. Policies designed to
address these issues include:
• measures to tackle skill shortages (see
p. 152) and establish a culture of lifelong
learning (see chapter 10);
• action to stimulate investment and
innovation, including changes to
corporation tax and capital gains tax (see
p. 394) and a new University Challenge
Fund (see p. 418); and
• measures to encourage competition,
improve regulation and promote open
markets, including the Competition Bill
(see chapter 26).
The Budget
The Budget is the Government’s main
economic statement of the year. In a major
speech to Parliament, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer reviews the nation’s economic
performance and describes the Government’s
economic objectives and the policies it intends
to follow in order to achieve them. The
Budget statement also includes details of the
taxes the Government proposes to finance the
coming year’s public spending.
The new Government’s initial Budget was
in July 1997, and its first full-scale Budget was
in March 1998. As part of its plans for greater
openness in public finance, it issued a Pre-
Budget Report in November 1997, which
reviewed the economy and the progress made
towards the Government’s economic
objectives, and contained a number of
proposed changes. This Pre-Budget
consultation exercise will be a feature of future
Budgets. In addition, an Economic and Fiscal
Strategy Report, setting out the Government’s
long-term strategy and objectives, is being
issued each year; the first report was published
in June 1998.
Public Finance Strategy
The first Economic and Fiscal Strategy
Report set out a fiscal framework, together
with overall spending limits for the next three
years, and a new regime for planning and
controlling public expenditure. This was
followed in July 1998 by the Comprehensive

on the River Thames, will be dominated by the Millennium Dome,
the largest building of its kind in the world. One kilometre in circumference,
its 20 acres of floor space will house the largest exhibition ever assembled.
I he Experience will be a car-free event, relying on public transport to bring

recorded and broadcast; Soundscapes - a three-dimensional surround-sound auditorium;
and an ever-changing programme of exhibitions and special events.
ECONOMY AND PUBLIC FINANCE
Spending Review, under which new spending
plans have been set for individual
departments, and resources reallocated to
match the Government’s priorities.
Current public expenditure is planned to
grow by 2.25% a year on average in real terms
over the next three years, while public sector
net investment is planned to more than double
over this period (see Table 23.5). Other
features of the new arrangements are:
• firm three-year plans to enable
departments to plan ahead and provide a
more stable foundation for managing
public services;
• separate capital and current budgets,
which better reflect the golden rule and
pave the way for resource accounting and
budgeting (see p. 391); and
• disposal of surplus government assets, in
order to fund new requirements for the
21st century.
A new format has been adopted for
presenting the public finances, which
corresponds more closely to the Government’s
two fiscal rules and is in line with best
international practice on national accounts.
MAIN PROGRAMMES AND
PRIORITIES
The main long-term trends in public
expenditure have been the growing proportion
of spending devoted to social security and
health (see Table 23.6, which also shows the
main sources of revenue), and the declining
proportion of spending in areas such as
defence and support for trade and industry.

how public expenditure will be reallocated to
priority programmes. Extra resources will go
to:
• education—the Government’s top
priority—where spending will increase
by a cumulative total of an extra £19,000
million over the next three years,
representing a rise of over 5% a year
across the UK in real terms;
• health, where over £20,000 million of
additional resources will be provided for
the National Health Service (NHS);
• public transport, with an extra £1,700
million to modernise the road and rail
network over the next three years; and
• the regeneration of the UK’s cities and
housing resources, for which an extra
£4,400 million has been allocated.
Areas where expenditure will fall in real terms
over the next three years include defence,
agriculture, the Cabinet Office and the Lord
Chancellor’s Department (as a result of the
reform of legal aid—see p. 237), while lower
debt interest payments on government
borrowing are envisaged.
The government departments with the
largest spending programmes are:
• the Department of Social Security (with
forecast expenditure of £95,200 million
on benefits in 1998-99);
A new Investing in Britain Fund will
provide for the renewal and modernisation
of the UK’s public sector capital stock.
Net public investment is planned to more
than double to around £10,800 million by
2001-02 (see Table 23.5). Over £2,500
million of the Fund will be overseen by
HM Treasury in a Capital Modernisation
Fund from 2000-01, which will be
allocated to departments on a competitive
basis.

ECONOMY AND PUBLIC FINANCE
• the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR)—
£42,300 million, of which £32,800
million is on local government (the
largest part of which is spent on
education) and regional policy;
• the Department of Health (£37,200
million); and
• the Ministry of Defence (£22,200
million).
Local authorities spent about £76,900
million in 1997—98, around a quarter of public
expenditure. The main categories of
expenditure are education, law and order,
personal social services, housing and other
environmental services, and roads and
transport.
Control of Spending
Previously there used to be an annual
spending round, under which government
departments would put in their bids for
expenditure for the following year, but this
has been abolished. Instead, departments now
have firm plans for 1999-2000 and the
following two financial years. These plans will
be rolled forward in 2000 when the
anticipated move to resource accounting and
budgeting begins (see below). A new concept
has been established to control public
expenditure—Total Managed Expenditure,
covering all public sector spending. Within
this concept, there are two control measures:
• Departmental Expenditure Limits,
involving a tightly drawn control figure
for each department, which is set in cash
terms and will be reviewed only if
inflation differs substantially from
forecast levels; and
• Annually Managed Expenditure,
covering expenditure such as social
security benefit payments, which cannot
reasonably be subject to limits covering
more than one year. This will be subject
to rigorous scrutiny as part of the Budget
process.
Spending plans showing the new concepts are
given in Table 23.7.
Improving Public Services
Other reforms have been introduced to improve
the effectiveness of public spending. New
public service agreements for each department
will include departmental objectives and
measurable efficiency and effectiveness targets.
There will be a continuous process of scrutiny
and audit, overseen by a Cabinet Committee
chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Initiatives include:
• new cross-departmental budgets, for
example, to improve rundown estates;
• an ‘Invest to Save’ budget, to encourage
different parts of the public sector to
work together to improve services and
cut costs;
• quality standards for all departments, to
ensure that they deliver effective public
services;
• new efficiency targets for key public
services, such as the NHS;
• incentives to encourage the disposal of
surplus government assets; and
• procurement reforms, to secure
significant cost savings, for example, in
defence procurement and support
services.
New Accounting Procedures
Cash-based government accounts are being
replaced by more commercial ‘resource
accounting’ and budgeting methods. The new
system is designed to bring improved
efficiency and focus more on departmental
objectives and outputs in terms of resources
used rather than the money available for
spending. The first full set of published
resource accounts for government
departments is expected to be produced in
1999-2000. Planning and controlling public
expenditure on a resource accounting basis
will be fully implemented for 2001-02, subject
to parliamentary approval.

Commons. These study in detail the activities
of particular government departments and
question ministers and officials.
The Public Accounts Committee considers
the accounts of government departments,
executive agencies and other public sector
bodies, and reports by the Comptroller and
Auditor General on departments and their use
of resources. It submits reports to Parliament.
Audit of the Government’s spending is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of
the National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO’s
responsibilities include certifying the accounts
of all government departments and executive
agencies and those of a wide range of other
public sector bodies; scrutinising the
efficiency and effectiveness of their
operations; examining revenue accounts and
inventories; and reporting the results of these
examinations to Parliament.
Public-Private Partnerships
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) aims to
bring the private sector more directly into the
provision of public services. The public sector
specifies the service or infrastructure needed,
and private sector companies compete to
provide these requirements. By October 1998
PFI projects with a capital value of around
£11,000 million in total had been signed.
Schemes in progress include the Channel
Tunnel Rail Link (see p. 370); several
hospitals; a number of ‘design, build, finance
and operate’ road projects (see p. 363); the
Croydon Tramlink (see p. 371); six new
prisons; a new National Insurance records
system; and a ‘smart card’ system for the
Benefits Agency.
The Government sees Public-Private
Partnerships as a key factor in the delivery of
high-quality public services. It has taken steps
to make the PFI process more effective, for
example, by abandoning the requirement for
universal testing of projects. A taskforce in
HM Treasury is acting as a focal point for all
PFI activities and provider of advice and
assistance to departments.
Plans for a number of new Public-Private
Partnerships were announced in mid-1998,
including:
• the proposed sale of a majority stake in
the National Air Traffic Services (see
392
ECONOMY AND PUBLIC FINANCE
p. 376) and the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (see p. 89);
• a new partnership for science between
the Government and the Wellcome
Trust, to modernise the UK’s research
capabilities, and a separate partnership
for the Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (see chapter 25); and
• examination of the Tote (see p. 300) and
the Royal Mint to see whether greater
private sector participation would be
appropriate.
DEBT MANAGEMENT
The Government funds its borrowing
requirement by selling debt to the private sector.
There has been a steady increase in government
debt during the 1990s. In 1997-98 net public
sector debt was £351,800 million, 42% of GDP,
as against 27% in 1990-91. However, the level
of debt is estimated to have peaked. Public sector
net borrowing (excluding the windfall tax and
associated spending) fell from £28,200 million in
1996-97 to £8,200 million in 1997-98. General
government gross debt was estimated at 50% of
GDP at the end of 1997-98.
The funding requirement for 1998-99 is
forecast to be about £6,500 million, to be met
mostly from sales of gilt-edged stock, with
National Savings products (see p. 517) expected
to contribute £100 million.
Government responsibility for debt
management was transferred from the Bank of
England to HM Treasury in April 1998. Day-
to-day responsibility rests with a new Treasury
agency, the United Kingdom Debt
Management Office (DMO).
Gilt-edged Stock
The major debt instrument, government
bonds, is known as gilt-edged stock (‘gilts’) as
there is no risk of default. Gilts are marketable
and widely traded; holdings of gilts total about
£300,000 million. Pension funds and life
insurance companies have the largest holdings.
An annual debt management report sets out
the framework for issuing gilts in the coming
year.
Gilt issues are primarily by auction. This
used to be broadly monthly, but the frequency
has been reduced with the recent decline in
government borrowing. Gilts include
‘conventionals’, which pay fixed rates of
interest and redemption sums; index-linked
stocks, on which principal and interest are
linked to movements in the Retail Prices
Index; and floating-rate gilts, with payments
linked to short-term interest rates. The DMO
is implementing a series of changes designed
to achieve the Government’s aim of improving
the gilts market; for example, auctions of
index-linked gilts will start in November 1998.
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax;
• taxes on capital, which include
inheritance tax, capital gains tax, council
tax and non-domestic rates;
• taxes on expenditure, which include
VAT (value added tax) and customs and
excise duties; and
• National Insurance contributions (see
chapter 12), which give entitlement to a
range of benefits, including the
Retirement Pension and Jobseeker’s
Allowance.
Taxation Policy
The general principles underlying the
Government’s taxation policy are that the tax
system should:
• encourage employment opportunities and
work incentives for everyone;
• promote savings and long-term
investment; and
• be fair, and be seen to be fair.
Tax Measures in the 1998 Budget
Changes to taxation announced in the Budget
in March 1998 are intended to encourage
393
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
work, promote enterprise and support
families. (For ‘green taxes’, to protect the
environment, see p. 314.)
Measures to Encourage Work
The Budget includes a number of reforms to
the tax and benefits system. These are
designed to ensure that work and opportunity
are encouraged and rewarded rather than
being discouraged, as currently happens for
some people who find that their income from
working is only slightly higher than it would
be if they were unemployed. The Government
has been assisted by a taskforce which looked
at streamlining and modernising the tax and
benefits system in order to help increase
employment opportunities and work
incentives, reduce poverty and welfare
dependency, and strengthen community
and family life.
The main measures are:
• a new Working Families Tax Credit
(WFTC), to be introduced in October
1999, which will replace Family Credit
(see chapter 12) and provide a guaranteed
minimum income for working families;
• a new childcare tax credit, within the
WFTC, designed to improve help with
the cost of childcare, which for many
parents is a barrier to work; and
• a major reform to the structure of
National Insurance contributions from
April 1999, which will simplify the
system and remove the distorting effect
at the lower end of the earnings scale
whereby some people can be worse off
through higher National Insurance
charges when their earnings increase.
Promoting Enterprise
Changes to corporate taxation, which follow on
from measures in the July 1997 Budget, are
designed to produce a corporate tax system
which promotes investment, encourages
enterprise and provides rewards for risk-taking.
In April 1999 advance corporation tax will be
abolished and the rates of corporation tax will be
cut, enhancing the UK’s position as having the
lowest main corporate tax rate among the major
EU economies. Fundamental reforms to the
capital gains tax system (see p. 396) are
intended to help investment through
encouraging longer-term holding of assets.
Long-term gains will be taxed less heavily than
short-term gains.
Encouraging Savings
Extensive consultations were carried out by
the Government before it announced final
arrangements for the new ‘individual savings
account’ (ISA). ISAs, which will start in April
1999 and run for at least ten years, are
designed to help encourage savings, especially
among those on more modest incomes, and to
distribute the tax relief on savings more fairly.
They will succeed TESSAs (Tax Exempt
Special Savings Accounts) and PEPs (Personal
Equity Plans) (see p. 521) as the means of new
tax-free investment. Each person will be able
to invest up to £5,000 a year in an ISA
(£7,000 in 1999-2000), including up to £1,000
in cash (£3,000 in 1999-2000) and £1,000 in
life insurance, with the balance in stocks and
shares. Savers will be exempt from income tax
and capital gains tax on their ISA investments.
Collection of Taxes and Duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects taxes
on income, profits and capital, and stamp duty.
HM Customs and Excise collects the most
important taxes on expenditure (VAT and
most duties). Responsibility for National
Insurance contributions rests with the
Contributions Agency, currently an agency of
the Department of Social Security, although it
is to transfer to the Inland Revenue in April
1999. The main local taxes—council tax and
non-domestic rates (see p. 398)—are collected
by local authorities.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Taxes on individual incomes are generally
progressive in that larger incomes are subject
to a greater amount of tax. Income tax is
imposed for the year of assessment beginning
394
ECONOMY AND PUBLIC FINANCE
on 6 April. The tax rates and bands for
1997-98 and 1998-99 are shown in Table 23.8
and apply to total income, including earned
and investment income. The Government has
announced that it will not raise the basic and
upper rates of income tax—23% and 40%
respectively—in the current Parliament. It has
a long-term objective of introducing a lower
starting rate of tax of 10%. Of around 26
million income taxpayers, 7.6 million are
expected to pay tax only at the existing lower
rate of 20% in 1998-99, about 16.2 million
will be basic rate taxpayers and 2.4 million will
be in the higher rate tax band.
Allowances and reliefs reduce an individual’s
income tax liability, and the main allowances
are shown in Table 23.8. All taxpayers are
entitled to a personal allowance against income
from all sources. In addition, there is a married
couple’s allowance, which may be allocated to
either partner, or they may receive half each.
Tax relief for some allowances, including the
married couple’s allowance, is restricted to 15%
(10% from April 1999).
Among the most important reliefs is that
for mortgage interest payments on borrowing
for house purchase up to a limit of £30,000.
Relief, which is limited to 10%, is usually
given ‘at source’, that is, repayments which
the borrower makes to the lender are reduced
to take account of tax relief and the tax refund
is passed directly by the tax authorities to the
lender rather than to the individual borrower.
Another significant relief covers employees’
contributions to their pension schemes.
In general, income tax is charged on all
income originating in the UK—although
some forms of income, such as child benefit,
are exempt—and on all income arising abroad
of people resident in the UK. Agreements
with over 100 countries provide relief from
double taxation, the largest network of tax
treaties in the world. UK residents working
abroad for the whole year may benefit from
100% tax relief.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)
system whereby tax is deducted and accounted

child at home, and by a taxpayer (with a dependent child) who has an incapacitated wife or husband living with him
or her.

for to the Inland Revenue by the employer, in
a way which enables most employees to pay
the correct amount of tax during the year.
A self-assessment system for collecting
personal taxation has been introduced.
Around 8 million people—primarily higher-
rate taxpayers, the self-employed and those
receiving investment income (particularly
where this is paid without tax being
deducted)—are required to complete a tax
return for the Inland Revenue. Taxpayers are
able to calculate their own tax liability,
although they can choose to have the
calculations done by the Inland Revenue.
Corporation Tax
Companies pay corporation tax on their
income and capital gains after deduction of
certain allowances and reliefs. The main rate of
corporation tax is 31%, with a reduced rate of
21% for small companies (those with profits
below £300,000 in a year). Relief is allowed for
companies with profits between £300,000 and
£1.5 million, so that the company’s overall rate
is between the main rate and the small
companies’ rate. Some capital expenditure may
qualify for relief in the form of capital
allowances. Examples include expenditure on
machinery and plant, industrial buildings,
agricultural buildings and scientific research.
Expenditure on machinery or plant by small or
medium-sized businesses qualifies for a first-
year allowance—40% for the year to July 1999.
A new system for corporation tax payments
will take effect from 1999. Under this system,
which is being phased in over a four-year
period and will bring the UK into line with
other major industrialised countries, around
20,000 large companies will pay corporation
tax in quarterly instalments. From April 1999
the rate of corporation tax will be cut to 30%
(20% for small companies) and advance
corporation tax, which is payable by companies
which distribute profits to their shareholders,
will be abolished. Self-assessment for
companies will also start in 1999.
Windfall Tax
The windfall tax is a one-off tax on the excess
profits of the privatised utilities, payable in
two instalments, in December 1997 and
December 1998. It is financing the
Government’s Welfare-to-Work programme
(see p. 155). The tax is charged at a rate of
23% on the difference between a company’s
value at flotation and the value calculated by
reference to profits over a period of up to four
years following privatisation. It is expected to
yield £5,200 million, including around £2,100
million from the electricity sector and £1,650
million from the water industry.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT), deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production—as
opposed, for example, to the refining—of oil
and gas in the UK and on its Continental
Shelf under licence from the Department of
Trade and Industry. Each licensee of an
oilfield or gasfield is charged at a rate of 50%
on the profits from that field after deduction
of certain allowances and reliefs. New fields
given consent for development on or after 16
March 1993 are not liable to PRT.
Taxes on Capital
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains tax (CGT) is payable by
individuals and trusts on gains realised from
Several fundamental changes were
announced to Capital Gains Tax for
individuals and trusts in the March 1998
Budget. These are designed to encourage
longer-term holding of assets. Indexation
relief to take account of the effects of
inflation no longer applies after April 1998.
Instead, a ‘taper’ reduces the amount of the
chargeable gain depending on how long an
asset has been held. For example, for a
business asset the percentage of the gain that
is chargeable is reduced from 100% for
assets held for less than one year to 25% for
assets held for ten years or more. For non¬
business assets the chargeable gain falls from
100% for assets held for less than three years
to 60% for assets held for ten years or longer.
396
ECONOMY AND PUBLIC FINANCE
the disposal of assets. It is payable on the
amount by which total chargeable gains for a
year exceed the exempt amount (£6,800 for
individuals and £3,400 for trusts in 1998-99).
Gains on some types of asset are exempt from
CGT. These include the principal private
residence, government securities, certain
corporate bonds, and gains on shares and
corporate bonds owned under PEPs. For
individuals, CGT is calculated at income tax
rates, as if the amount were additional taxable
income; there are special rates for trusts.
The Government is considering the tax
treatment of capital gains by companies—which
are currently liable to corporation tax—in the
light of the changes to CGT for individuals.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is charged on estates at the time
of death and on gifts made within seven years of
death; most other lifetime transfers are not
taxed. There are several important exemptions.
Generally, transfers between spouses are
exempt, and gifts and bequests to British
charities, major political parties and heritage
bodies are also normally exempt. In general,
business assets and farmland are exempt from
inheritance tax, so that most family businesses
can be passed on without a tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40% above
a threshold, currently £223,000. Only about
3% of estates a year become liable for an
inheritance tax bill.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax (VAT)
VAT is a broadly based expenditure tax, with
a standard rate of 17.5%. A reduced rate of
5% applies on domestic fuel and power, and
on the installation of energy-saving materials
in low-income households under government
schemes. VAT is collected at each stage in the
production and distribution of goods and
services. The final tax is payable by the
consumer.
The annual level of turnover above which
traders must register for VAT is £50,000.
Certain goods and services are relieved from
VAT, either by being charged at a zero rate or
by being exempt.
• Under zero rating, a taxable person does
not charge tax to a customer but
reclaims any input tax paid to suppliers.
Among the main categories where zero¬
rating applies are goods exported to
other countries; most food; water and
sewerage for non-business use; domestic
and international passenger transport;
books, newspapers and periodicals;
construction of new residential
buildings; young children’s clothing and
footwear; drugs and medicines supplied
on prescription; specified aids for
handicapped people; and certain
supplies by or to charities.
• For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any output tax
but is not entitled to reclaim the input
tax. The main categories where
exemption applies are many supplies of
land and buildings; insurance and other
financial services; postal services; betting;
gaming (with certain important
exceptions); lotteries; much education
and training; and health and welfare.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the EU in accordance with its
Common Customs Tariff. Goods can move
freely across internal EU frontiers without
making customs entries at importation or
stopping for routine fiscal checks. For
commercial consignments, excise duty and
VAT are charged in the member state of
destination, at the rate in force in that state.
Excise Duties
Mineral oils used as road fuel are subject to
higher rates of duty than those used for other
purposes. However, there are reduced rates to
encourage the use of more environmentally
friendly fuels, such as unleaded petrol, ultra
low sulphur diesel, and gas used as road fuel.
Kerosene not used as road fuel, most
lubricating oils and oils used for certain
industrial, horticultural and marine uses are
free of duty or attract very low rates. Fuel
397
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
substitutes are taxed at the same rate as the
corresponding mineral oil. There are duties on
spirits, beer, wine, made-wine (wine with
added constituents, such as fruit juice), cider
and perry, charged according to alcoholic
strength and volume. Spirits used for
scientific, medical, research and industrial
processes are generally free of duty.
Cigarette duty is charged partly as a cash
amount per cigarette and partly as a
percentage of retail price. Duty on other
tobacco products is based on weight. The
Government is committed to raising tobacco
duties by at least 5% a year in real terms, as
part of its policy of discouraging smoking
(see p. 188).
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
amusement machines. Rates vary with the
particular form of gambling. Duty is levied
either as a percentage of gross or net stakes
or, in the case of amusement machines, as a
fixed amount per machine according to the
cost of playing and the prize level. On the
National Lottery (see pp. 120—1) there is a
12% duty on gross stakes, but no tax on
winnings.
The annual vehicle excise duty (VED) on a
privately owned motor car, light van or taxi is
£150. The duty on goods vehicles is levied on
the basis of gross weight and, if over 12
tonnes, according to the number of axles; it is
designed to ensure that such vehicles at least
cover their share of the full costs of road use
through the tax paid (VED and fuel duty).
Duty on taxis and buses varies according to
seating capacity, and duty on motorcycles
according to engine capacity. Privately owned
vehicles—cars, taxis, motorcycles and non¬
commercial vehicles—built before 1973 are
exempt from VED. Lower rates of VED for
the least polluting vehicles are planned from
1999, with rates cut by £50 for the least
polluting cars, and by up to £500 for low-
emission lorries and buses.
Other taxes include:
• insurance premium tax chargeable at 4%
on all types of taxable insurance risk in
the UK (unless specifically exempted) or
at 17.5% on travel insurance and on
insurance sold by suppliers of cars and
domestic appliances;
• air passenger duty of £10 for flights to
internal destinations and to those in the
European Economic Area and £20
elsewhere; and
• a landfill tax of £7 a tonne (£10 from
April 1999), with a lower rate of £2 a
tonne for inert waste.
Stamp Duty
Some transfers are subject to stamp duty.
Transfers of shares attract duty at 0.5% of the
cost, while certain instruments, such as
declarations of trust, have small fixed duties of
50p or £1. Transfers by gift and transfers to
charities are exempt. The 1997 and 1998
Budgets raised the rate of stamp duty on the
transfers of property (except shares) over
£250,000, in order to encourage stability in
the housing market. Duty is now payable at
1% of the total price above £60,000, 2% for
property above £250,000 and 3% for property
where the price exceeds £500,000.
Other Revenue
National Insurance Contributions
Details of the five classes of National
Insurance contribution and the rates of
contribution are given in chapter 12 on
p. 174.
Local Authority Revenue
Local authorities in Great Britain have four
main sources of revenue income: grants from
central government; council tax; non-domestic
rates (sometimes known as business rates); and
sales, fees and charges. About 75% of
expenditure (excluding sales, fees and charges)
is financed by government grants and
redistributed non-domestic rates.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value of property is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every
five years. The non-domestic rate is set
nationally by central government and collected
by local authorities. It is paid into a national
pool and redistributed to local authorities in
398
ECONOMY AND PUBLIC FINANCE
proportion to their population. The
Government proposes to allow local
authorities to set a supplementary local rate,
subject to a central limit and to the authorities
demonstrating effective consultation and
partnership arrangements with their local
businesses. This forms part of the
Government’s proposals for modernising local
government, contained in its White Paper
issued in 1998 (see chapter 6).
Domestic property in Great Britain is
generally subject to the council tax. Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
bands, based on its capital value (the amount it
might have sold for on the open market) in
April 1991. Discounts are available for
dwellings with fewer than two resident adults,
and those on low incomes may receive council
tax benefit of up to 100% of the tax bill (see
p. 182).
In Northern Ireland, rates—local domestic
property taxes based on the value of the
property—are collected by local authorities.

Trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for hundreds of
years. With only about l°/o of the world's population, the UK is the fifth largest
trading nation, accounting for around 5% of world trade in goods and services.
As a member of the European Union (EU), it is part of the world s largest
established trading group, and over half of the UK’s external trade is with other
EU members. In 1997 the UK recorded its first surplus on the current account
of the balance of payments since 1985. The UK has a higher degree of inward
and outward investment than any other leading economy, relative to gross
domestic product (GDP), and is second only to the United States as a
destination for international direct investment. The UK is encouraging the
World Trade Organisation (WTO) to take further action to reduce tariff and
non-tariff barriers and to liberalise world services markets, as well as
supporting work on trade and investment and on investment liberalisation in
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The UK exports more per head than the
United States and Japan. Its sales abroad of
goods and services are equivalent to about
22% of total final expenditure. Re-exporting
plays a prominent role in trade. Receipts
from trade in services (such as financial
services, business services, travel, transport
and communications) and investment
income make up about half of total British
external earnings, and the UK consistently
runs large surpluses on these accounts. It is
the world’s second biggest foreign investor
and British investors have more direct
investments abroad than overseas firms have
in the UK.1
TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES
In 1997 the UK’s exports of goods were
valued at .£171,798 million and imports at
£183,590 million on a balance-of-payments
basis (see Table 24.1). Between 1996 and 1997
the volume of exports of goods grew by 8%
and of imports by 9%. By value, however, the
rises were only 3% and 2% respectively,
1 Direct investment abroad consists of investment in
branches, subsidiaries and associated companies, giving
the investor a significant influence over the operations of
the company. The other main type of overseas investment
is known as portfolio investment; it consists of investment
in the securities of companies registered abroad and
governments and does not entitle the investor to any
significant influence over company operations.

which reflected the appreciation in sterling.
Nevertheless, UK exports held up well during
1997, mainly as a result of the strong growth
in world trade. However, the balance of trade
in goods has deteriorated during 1998, as the
growth in imports has exceeded that in
exports, which have been affected by the
continuing strength of sterling and the effects
of the financial difficulties in Asia.
Commodity Composition
The UK traditionally used to be an exporter
of manufactured goods and an importer of
food and basic materials. Manufactures—
finished manufactures and semi-manufactured
goods—accounted for 84% of UK exports in
1970. Although this level declined following
the start of North Sea oil exports in the mid-
1970s, it has recovered and by 1997 was again
84% (see Table 24.2). The UK has not,
however, had a surplus on manufactures since
1982. Machinery and transport equipment
account for about 46% of exports and 44% of
imports (see Table 24.3). Aerospace,
chemicals and electronics have become
increasingly significant export sectors, while
textiles have declined in relative importance.
Sectors where the UK has a positive balance
of trade include chemicals, fuels (with a
positive contribution in 1997 of over £4,400
million from oil and petroleum products), and
beverages and tobacco.
Imported manufactures have taken a
greater share of the domestic market in recent
decades. Between 1970 and 1997 the share of
finished manufactures in total imports rose
from 25% to 58%, while the share of basic
materials fell from 15% to 3%. The
percentage of food, beverages and tobacco in
total imports has been dropping since the
1950s, down to less than 9% in 1997, as a
result both of the extent to which food
demand has been met from domestic
agriculture and of the decline in the
proportion of total expenditure on food.
Geographical Distribution

for goods, which had been held by Germany
since 1990. Exports to, and imports from,
Germany both declined in 1997, although it
retained the position of the UK’s largest single
supplier, sending nearly 14% of UK imports.
UK exports to a number of areas increased
significantly in 1997, including:
• Saudi Arabia, up by 53% to £3,801 million;
• Eastern Europe, up by 18% to £2,680
million; and
• a number of Asian markets, including
Hong Kong (by 10% to £3,214 million)
and the People’s Republic of China (by
25% to £922 million).
404
OVERSEAS TRADE AND INVESTMENT
During 1998 the financial crisis in Asia has led
to falls in UK exports to a number of Asia
Pacific markets, as demand from these
markets has weakened and their currencies
have depreciated.
Services
The UK has had a surplus on trade in services
since 1966. The surplus rose by 25% in 1997
to a record £11,160 million, reflecting large
increases in the surpluses for insurance,
financial services, royalties and licence fees,
and other business services. Exports of
services rose by 8%, to £56,904 million while
imports of services were up by 4% to £45,744
million. Financial and other business services
made particularly large contributions to the
overall surplus on services, recording positive
balances of £6,107 million and £7,711 million
respectively (see Table 24.6).
OTHER TRANSACTIONS
Earnings on investment income on external
assets increased by 7% to £108,420 million in
1997, while debits rose by 3% to £96,335
million (see Table 24.7). The surplus on
investment income reached a record £12,085
million, 51% higher than in 1996. Within this,
there were surpluses on earnings from direct
investment of £14,350 million and from
portfolio investment of £2,548 million,
although these were partly offset by a deficit
on other investments such as banks’
borrowing and lending.
Transfers (chiefly between governments,
between the UK Government and EU
organisations, and between private
individuals) have almost always been in
deficit, amounting to £3,530 million in
1997—with a surplus on central government
transfers of £1,287 million and a deficit on
other transfers of £4,817 million.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The UK’s balance of payments statistics
record transactions between residents of the
UK and non-residents. Major changes have
been adopted for the 1998 edition of the Office
for National Statistics publication United
Kingdom Balance of Payments—the Pink Book
to ensure that the statistics are consistent with
internationally agreed statistics.
The current account records trade in goods
and services, transactions in investment
income, and transfers. In 1997 there was a
positive balance on the UK’s current account,
of £8,006 million (see Table 24.8), the first
since 1985 and the highest since records
began in 1946. The improvement reflected
the record surpluses on services and
investment income.

Financial transactions include inward and
outward investment, external borrowing and
lending by UK banks in the UK, external
borrowing and lending by other UK residents,
and drawings on and accruals to the official
reserves. In 1997 there was a surplus of £262
million on the capital account and net
investment abroad of £8,112 million on the
financial account. Exchange controls in the
UK were abolished in 1979; residents are free
to acquire foreign currency for any purpose,
including direct and portfolio investment
abroad. The UK meets in full its obligations
on capital movements under an OECD code
and under EC directives.
At the end of 1997 the stock of inward
direct investment (investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies which
gives the investor an effective role in their
management) in the UK was around £170,572
million. Investment from developed countries
accounts for around 96%, with 39% from the
United States and 33% from the EU. The
stock of direct investment abroad by UK
residents was £225,766 million, of which
around 84% was in developed countries. The
stock of portfolio investment in the UK by
non-residents amounted to £501,310 million,
while the stock of UK portfolio investment
abroad was £595,484 million. The UK’s
406
OVERSEAS TRADE AND INVESTMENT
identified external liabilities exceeded assets
by £33,707 million.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY
The Government is committed to promoting
open world markets in goods and services, and
to the further liberalisation of international
direct investment. The UK plays a leading role
in achieving these objectives through work in
the WTO, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the OECD, as well as the EU.
European Union
The single European market ‘opened for
business’ in 1993, with the essential legislation
in place for the free movement of goods,
services, people and capital within the EU.
This has involved the abolition of exchange
controls; the end of routine customs clearance
of commercial goods at national frontiers
within the EU; harmonisation and mutual
recognition of technical standards; and the
right to trade financial services throughout the
EU on the basis of a single home authorisation
‘passport’ (see p. 512).
Improving the effectiveness and scope of
the single market was one of the key priorities
of the UK’s Presidency of the EU in the first
half of 1998 (see chapter 7). The Government
aims to ensure:
• effective enforcement of the single
market across the EU, both generally and
in specific sectors;
• simplification of rules and better quality
regulation where this does not reduce the
effectiveness of the single market;
• liberalisation of the electricity, gas and
telecommunications sectors in the EU;
and
• effective monitoring of the single market,
to maintain and promote its
development, particularly in the context
of the introduction of the single currency
(see p. 77).
All these are priority areas of the Action Plan
for the Single Market, adopted by the
European Commission in 1997. The
Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTPs)
Action Single Market Unit helps companies
which encounter illegal barriers to trade to
overcome them and also pursues complaints
about illegal state aids to domestic producers.
The UK Government supports efforts to
extend the single market to those countries of
central and eastern Europe that are applying
for EU membership (see p. 77).
World Trade Organisation
The eighth GATT (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade) round—the Uruguay
Round—was launched in 1986 and
successfully concluded in 1993. It was the
biggest ever multilateral trade negotiation and
established the World Trade Organisation as
successor to the GATT at the beginning of
1995. There are currently 132 WTO
members, and over 30 countries are
negotiating to join.
The WTO incorporates the GATT, which
covers trade in goods and agreements in a
number of other areas, including agriculture,
services, textiles, intellectual property,
subsidies, technical barriers to trade, and
trade-related investment measures. A new
binding dispute settlement procedure was also
agreed.
Overall tariff reductions achieved during
the Uruguay Round amount to about 40%
across all countries. Members also agreed not
to raise tariffs again on 95% of world trade.
Since the end of the Uruguay Round,
agreements have been reached in a number of
specific additional areas:
• financial services, where WTO members
have undertaken to offer improved access
to their markets for foreign suppliers;
• information technology, where tariffs on
a wide range of IT products will be
phased out by 2000; and
• telecommunications services, where a
package of measures involves 69
countries (representing over 91% of the
world telecommunications market)
guaranteeing access to their markets.
The UK fully supports the work of the WTO
and its dispute settlement system, and is
committed to reducing both tariff and
407
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
non-tariff barriers that still remain through the
multilateral trading system. The Government
supports the European Commission’s
proposals for the next round of WTO trade
negotiations in 2000, with a comprehensive
liberalising agenda, including the areas of:
• agriculture;
• services;
• substantial reductions in tariffs;
• a multilateral framework for investment
and competition;
• promoting greater transparency in WTO
procedures and rule-making; and
• increasing the integration of developing
countries into the multilateral trade
system.
Relations with Other Countries
The UK places great importance on
developing strong relations with third
countries, in particular through the EU.
Three examples are:
• the Transatlantic Economic Partnership,
which was agreed at the EU-United
States Summit in May 1998 (see p. 84);
• the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), an
inter-regional forum, which the UK sees
as providing opportunities to encourage
further efforts towards trade
liberalisation among ASEM’s 25 member
countries, including the newly
industrialising countries in Asia; and
• bilateral investment promotion and
protection agreements with 90 nations,
mainly developing countries.
Special Trading Arrangements
The multilateral trading system provides the
foundation for the EU’s common commercial
policy. However, the EU has preferential
trading arrangements with a number of
countries. These fall into three main categories:
• Those that prepare countries in central
and eastern Europe for possible EU
membership. Europe (Association)
The UK launched an initiative in
February 1998 to increase the amount of
European technical assistance available to
the countries in Asia affected by the
financial difficulties there. The initiative
involves:
• an ASEM Trust Fund, which is
being established at the World Bank
to help countries to assess the impact
of the crisis on poverty and to assist
with the restructuring of their
financial sectors; and
• more effective co-ordination of
technical assistance in the financial
sector.
Agreements (see p. 81) are designed to
facilitate closer political and economic
ties and the eventual liberalisation of
trade with a view to these countries
becoming full members of the EU.
• The EU has association and co-operation
agreements with virtually all non¬
member countries with a Mediterranean
coastline, plus Jordan. These provide for
the eventual setting up of a freetrade area
between the EU and these countries by
the year 2010.
• Those that provide an economic
dimension to its assistance to former
dependent territories. Trade relations
with these countries (known as AGP
countries—African, Caribbean and
Pacific) are governed by the Lome
Convention, which gives them tariff-free
access, subject to certain safeguards, to
the EU for industrial and agricultural
products. The EU also operates a
Generalised System of Preferences
(GSP), which is available to nearly all
developing countries and applies to
industrial products, including textiles
and certain (mainly processed)
agricultural products.
New trade relationships with countries and
regions of Latin America are being pursued.
Work is in progress on developing a free trade
408
OVERSEAS TRADE AND INVESTMENT
agreement with Mexico, and proposals for
new agreements with the Mercosur regional
economic area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay) and Chile are under
consideration.
Partnership and co-operation (non-
preferential) agreements have been concluded
with ten states of the former Soviet Union.
Non-preferential co-operation agreements
have also been made with countries in South
Asia and Latin America, as well as with the
People’s Republic of China, the Association of
South East Asian Nations, the Andean Pact,
and the Central American States.
Controls on Trade
Import Controls
Following the completion of the single
European market, all national quantitative
restrictions have been abolished. However,
some EU-wide quotas have been imposed on a
small range of non-textile and clothing
products from the People’s Republic of China,
while EU imports of some steel products from
Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan are also
restricted. Quantitative restrictions on textiles
and clothing stem from the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA), under which there is a
series of bilateral agreements. Some quotas are
also maintained for imports from non-WTO
countries. The MFA restrictions will be
eliminated by 2005 as part of the Uruguay
Round agreement.
Imports from certain countries remain
subject to sanctions or embargo agreed by, for
example, the United Nations. Imports of
certain other goods from all countries are
prohibited or restricted in order to protect
human, animal or plant life and health. These
include firearms and ammunition; nuclear
materials; certain drugs; explosives;
endangered wildlife and derived products;
pornographic material; and certain
agricultural, horticultural and food products.
Export Controls
The great majority of UK exports are not
subject to any government control. However,
controls on certain strategic goods—
conventional military goods, arms,
ammunition and related materials as well as
dual-use industrial goods that can be used for
civil and military purposes—are imposed for a
variety of reasons, including foreign policy
and non-proliferation concerns, the need to
comply with international treaty
commitments, the operation of sanctions and
national security. The scope of export controls
is limited to what is necessary to meet these
concerns. Most controls apply on a worldwide
basis, although certain sanctions and
embargoes are applied against specific
countries as a result of agreement by members
of bodies such as the United Nations.
In July 1998 the Government issued a
White Paper, Strategic Export Controls,
containing proposals to modernise and
improve the accountability of controls on
exports of strategic goods. The main
proposal would involve the introduction of
new legislation to update the
Government’s powers and to provide
appropriate parliamentary scrutiny of
these powers. Government powers to take
action against the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction would be
strengthened. Improvements are also
planned in export licensing procedures.
Inward and Outward Investment
The UK has an open economy, and there are
no restrictions on the outward flow of capital.
Outward investment helps to develop markets
for UK exports while providing earnings in
the form of investment income. Inward
investment is promoted by the Invest in
Britain Bureau (IBB—see p. 443), which
reports jointly to the DTI and the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (FCO). This
investment is seen as a means of introducing
new technology, products and management
styles; and creating or safeguarding
employment.
The IBB was notified of 618 inward
investment projects from 30 countries in
1997-98, which are expected to create or
409
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
safeguard over 124,000 jobs. Inward
investment is playing an increasingly
important role in the UK economy, with
overseas firms providing 17% of
manufacturing employment, 26% of net
output and 33% of manufacturing net capital
expenditure. Overseas firms now account for
over 40% of the UK’s top 100 exporting
companies. At present, the UK has around
40% of US and over 40% of Japanese
investment in the EU. Inward investment has
benefited a range of industries, including
telecommunications and the information
sector, electronics, medical equipment,
pharmaceuticals, financial services, food and
drink, and the automotive industry. Among
the reasons quoted for locating in the UK are
the flexible and adaptable workforce, stable
labour relations, relatively low taxation, the
English language, open markets, economic
stability and commitment to the EU.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government provides a wide range of
advice and practical support to meet the needs
of exporters. This support is designed to help
businesses, especially small and medium-sized
enterprises, through all stages of the exporting
process.
Export Promotion Services
The Department of Trade and Industry and
the Foreign & Commonwealth Office provide
support for exporters through the joint
Overseas Trade Services (OTS) operation,
which has a network of some 1,500 staff
worldwide to help UK businesses compete
successfully throughout the world. The cost of
the OTS export promotion programme in
1997-98 was around £220 million.
The network comprises country help desks,
whose staff include export promoters
seconded from industry, and other teams
providing export information services in
DTFs headquarters in London; the
commercial sections at about 220 FCO
diplomatic posts abroad; 85 Business Links
throughout England (see p. 438); Scottish
Trade International; Welsh Office Industry
and Training Department; and the Industrial
Development Board for Northern Ireland.
Services include export intelligence, market
information, help in researching potential
markets and finding partners, and support for
firms participating in trade fairs and missions.
The Government’s trade promotion policy
is guided by the British Overseas Trade Board
(BOTB). The BOTB is supported by:
• a Markets Group, responsible for
advising on the OTS’s geographical
market priorities;
• a Sectors Group, which provides a link
between the OTS and those responsible
for promoting the export performance of
particular sectors;
• a Regional Group, which advises how the
Government’s export promotion support
can help small and medium-sized
businesses take full advantage of overseas
business opportunities; and
• 14 area advisory groups providing
expertise on particular world markets.
In all, nearly 300 representatives from the
private sector help direct the Government’s
export promotion effort.
A review in 1997 of export promotion
services, conducted by the Export Forum
(comprising representatives of the private and
public sectors), has confirmed the value of the
Government’s role in trade promotion and of
the various support programmes. However, it
did find scope for improvement, for example,
in better targeting of markets. Changes made
have included:
• a new National Exporters Database,
introduced in July 1998;
• a new Export Sales Leads Service—an
Internet-based service to put UK
exporters in touch with sales
opportunities abroad, using the services
of UK embassies and high
commissions—which began in
September 1998; and
• a simpler system of support for trade
fairs—the Support for Exhibitions and
Seminars Abroad scheme—which applies
to events held after 1 April 1999.
Programmes of additional activity, based on
selected key markets, are being developed.
410
OVERSEAS TRADE AND INVESTMENT
These cover, for new exporters, Western
Europe and the United States and, for
experienced exporters, South Africa, India,
Poland, Russia, China, Japan, South East
Asia, Brazil, Turkey and Egypt.
Export Insurance
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) is a government department,
responsible to the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry, which helps UK firms
overcome many of the risks of selling and
investing abroad. It supports UK exporters of
capital goods and services usually sold on
medium- and long-term credit by:
• guaranteeing exporters and financing
banks against the risk of non-payment by
foreign buyers/borrowers;
• giving interest rate support to UK banks,
allowing foreign borrowers access to
funds at fixed, often favourable, rates of
interest; and
• providing reinsurance to private sector
insurance companies covering UK
exports sold on short-term credit.
In order to encourage investment in less
developed countries, ECGD also insures
investment earnings against the main political
risks, such as war, expropriation and
restrictions on repatriation of profits.
ECGD is consulting exporters and the
financial sector on the current arrangements
for providing support for export financing and
on options for possible improvements.

The United Kingdom has a long tradition of research in science, engineering and
technology in universities, research institutes and industry. It carries out more
than 5% of global research and development (R&D). More Nobel Prizes for
science (over 70) have been won by scientists from Britain than any country
except the United States. The most recent British winners have both shared the
chemistry prize: Dr John Walker of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
Cambridge, in 1997; and Professor John Pople, who works in the United States, in
1998. An additional £1,400 million is to be spent on the science and engineering
base in the next three years, including a contribution of £400 million from the
Wellcome Trust, the world's largest research charity, in a ground-breaking joint
initiative with the Government. Microsoft of the United States, the world s
foremost computer software company, plans to construct a £50 million research
facility in Cambridge, to be headed by Professor Roger Needham.
Government policy is to reinvigorate the
science and engineering base (see p. 415),
maintaining the UK’s international position of
scientific excellence; and to maximise the
contribution of science, engineering and
technology to economic competitiveness and
the quality of life by promoting the
widespread adoption of innovation, in its
broadest sense.
A key role is undertaken by the public
sector as the prime funder of purely curiosity-
driven (or basic) science: as well as playing a
crucial part in advancing scientific knowledge
and producing well-trained people, such
research can often lead to unexpectedly
exploitable results. Business has the prime
responsibility for researching and developing
new and improved products and services;
while government promotes the climate for
the development and successful exploitation of
new ideas through the Foresight Programme
(which encourages the appreciation and use of
the UK’s science base—see p. 416), and tries
to facilitate technology transfer and access.
Industry is being encouraged to invest more in
R&D and to take a longer-term view of R&D
investment.
The Government’s policies on science,
engineering and technology are being
developed in the light of its overall public
spending strategy and of the Dearing
Committee Report on the financing of higher
412
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
education (see p. 141). The UK’s participation
in European Union (EU) co-operative R&D is
being strengthened; negotiations are nearing
completion on the content and organisation of
the EU Fifth Framework Programme, due to
run from 1999 to 2002 (see pp. 423^1).
BACKGROUND
British achievements in science and
technology in the 20th century include
fundamental contributions to molecular
genetics through the discovery of the three-
dimensional molecular structure of DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) by Francis Crick,
Maurice Wilkins, James Watson and Rosalind
Franklin in 1953; and of the 3-D molecular
structure of cholesterol, vitamin D, penicillin
and insulin by Dorothy Hodgkin. Notable
contributions in other areas over the past 25
years have been made by Stephen Hawking in
improving the understanding of the nature
and origin of the universe; Brian Josephson in
identifying phenomena that occur in
superconducting materials (which have
abnormally high electrical conductivity at low
temperatures); Martin Ryle and Antony
Hewish in radio astrophysics; and Godfrey
Hounsfield in computer-assisted tomography
(a form of radiography) for medical diagnosis.
Other pioneering work includes the
discovery in 1985 by British Antarctic Survey
scientists of the hole in the ozone layer over the
Antarctic. Researchers at the Laboratory of
Molecular Biology, Cambridge, produced the
first monoclonal antibodies—proteins with
enormous potential in the diagnosis and
treatment of disease. More recently there have
been several British breakthroughs in genetics
research, including the identification of the
gene in the Y chromosome responsible for
determining sex, and the identification of other
genes linked to diseases such as cystic fibrosis
and a form of breast cancer. The world’s first
pig with a genetically modified heart was bred
by scientists at Cambridge University, an
important milestone in breeding animals as
organ donors for people. In 1997 scientists at
the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh announced
that they had succeeded in ‘cloning’ a sheep
using a cell from an adult sheep’s mammary
gland.
Other areas of UK achievement in R&D
include:
• Materials—The UK devotes a substantial
proportion of its R&D resources to
developing materials and processes, and
important advances have been made in
industrial sectors such as aerospace,
defence, telecommunications, power
generation, offshore oil and gas structures,
medical engineering, construction and
packaging. The UK is at the leading edge
of materials science and technology in the
areas of high temperature materials,
weight-saving technologies,
superconductivity, offshore materials and
materials processing, and has considerable
manufacturing capability in these sectors.
It is also well advanced in engineering
ceramics and ceramic composites, surface
coatings, high temperature metals,
polymers, elastomers, polymer
composites, and metal matrix composites.
• Chemicals—Research in the chemical
industry has led to many significant
technological and commercial
breakthroughs. ICPs water-based paints
and ozone-friendly CFG replacements
are now in widespread use. Tioxide has
developed an environmentally friendly
method of making titanium dioxide, and
at BP a new catalyst has improved acetic
acid production. Exploratory work at
Nottingham University is helping to
bring the new field of supercritical fluid
separations into industrial processes.
• The most research-intensive sector of the
chemical industry is pharmaceuticals.
British firms have discovered and
developed four of the world’s 20 best¬
selling drugs (see p. 475), including the
first successful beta blockers (drugs used
to treat cardiovascular conditions and
stomach ulcers). Other successes include
semi-synthetic penicillins, vaccines and
treatments for cancer, asthma, migraine,
arthritis and HIV/AIDS. Companies
such as Zeneca and Chiroscience have
used chirality1 to make more closely
tailored drugs and agrochemicals.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• Biotechnology—Second only to that of the
United States, the UK biotechnology
industry continues to grow in size and
scientific importance. Many research
projects focus on the application of
biotechnology to pharmaceuticals,
chemicals, food, agriculture, diagnostics
and the environmental industries.
Important R&D activities include gene
therapy, regulation of the cell cycle, and
the development of transgenic animals as
sources of organs and as bioreactors.
Biotechnology has led to the manufacture
of agricultural and other food products
using genetic modification. Major
advances have taken place in the
development of drugs such as human
insulin and interferons, vaccines,
antibiotics and bactericidal drugs.
Therapies based on correcting the
function of defective genes are also under
development; diseases being targeted
include cystic fibrosis. Agricultural
products include infection-resistant
crops. Zeneca, whose genetically
modified tomato paste is already on the
market, is a world leader in plant
breeding.
• Electronics—British firms and research
organisations have led in the
development and application of
semiconductors, including the ‘three-
five’ semiconductor materials (such as
gallium arsenide). These materials have
many uses, including lasers for optical
fibre communications, microwave
devices for satellite communications, and
high-efficiency solar cells. Other
important areas are optical fibre cable;
software engineering for
telecommunications and other
applications; magnetic resonance
imaging; and the development of ‘virtual
reality’ techniques used for designing
buildings, vehicles, pharmaceuticals and
a host of other products.
• Aerospace—Pioneering British
achievements since the 1930s include
radar, jet engines, supersonic transport
(with France), automatic landing, vertical
take-off and landing, ski-jump take-offs,
ejector seats, head-up displays, and many
developments in materials technology.
British Aerospace, with Marconi and
Dowty Boulton Paul, devised a system
known as ‘fly-by-wire’, in which flying
control surfaces are moved by electronic
rather than mechanical signals. British
Aerospace is currently working with
government and academic laboratories on
the use of ‘smart’ materials in aircraft. In
one example, these are in the form of
sensors to be incorporated during
manufacture into the aircraft structure to
produce a ‘sensitive skin’. In theory, such
smart materials would continuously
monitor for signs of damage or wear and
communicate with the pilot through fibre
optic cables, thereby improving safety
and lowering maintenance costs.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EXPENDITURE
Gross domestic expenditure in the UK on
R&D in 1996 was ^14,340 million, 1.94% of
gross domestic product (GDP). Of this
£12,254 million was on civil R&D, with the
rest going to defence projects.
About 47% of total funding was provided
by industry and 33% by government in 1996;
a further 16% came from abroad. Significant
contributions were also made by private
endowments, trusts and charities. As well as
financing R&D carried out within industry
itself, industry supports university research
and finances contract research at government
establishments. Some charities have their own
laboratories and offer grants for outside
research. Contract research organisations
carry out R&D for companies and are playing
an increasingly important role in the transfer
of technology to British industry.
Total spending on R&D in industry
amounted to £9,300 million in 1996. Of this
total, industry’s own contribution was 69%,
with 10% coming from government and
virtually all of the rest from overseas. The
chemistry and biotechnology-based sectors
—chemicals, pharmaceuticals and healthcare
—account for about a third of R&D spending
by listed companies; the electronics and
aerospace sectors are also big investors in
R&D. The three biggest investors in R&D—

Note: R&D spending includes spending overseas.
Among overseas private sector companies
with major R&D investments in the
United Kingdom are Daewoo, Du Pont,
Pfizer, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Nissan,
Sharp and Sony. Eight of the United
States’ top ten software firms, including
Microsoft, have large-scale R&D facilities
in the UK. South-east England has the
highest concentration of R&D operations.
The strong industry-academic links that
exist in the UK are one of the main reasons
quoted for locating in the country.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
Science, engineering and technology issues are
the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),
assisted by a Minister for Science; they are
supported by the Office of Science and
Technology (OST), a separate entity within
the DTI. The OST, headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, is
responsible for policy on science, engineering
and technology, both nationally and
internationally, and co-ordinates science and
technology policy across government
departments. The Council for Science and
Technology, the Government’s premier
independent advisory group, advises the
Prime Minister on the strategic policies and
framework for science and technology in the
UK. Its members are drawn from academia,
business and charitable sponsors.
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is
used to describe the research and postgraduate
training capacity based in the universities and
colleges of higher education and in
establishments operated by the Research
Councils and some non-charitable bodies,
together with the national and international
central facilities (such as CERN—see p. 424)
supported by the Councils and available for
use by British scientists and engineers. There
are also important contributions from private
institutions, chiefly those funded by charities.
The science and engineering base is the main
provider of basic research and much of the
strategic research (research likely to have
practical applications) carried out in the UK.
It also collaborates with the private sector in
the conduct of specific applied research.
The OST has specific responsibility for the
Science Budget and the government-financed
Research Councils (see pp. 425-8):
• the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC);
• the Medical Research Council (MRC);
• the Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council (PPARC);
• the Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC);
• the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council (BBSRC);
• the Economic and Social Research
Council (ESRC); and
• the Council for the Central Laboratory of
the Research Councils (CCLRC).
The Science Budget covers expenditure in the
academic sector, Research Council institutes
and units, certain international research
centres, and grant-in-aid to the Royal Society
and the Royal Academy of Engineering.
415
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Through the Research Councils, OST funding
provides support for research in the following
ways: by awarding grants and contracts to
universities and other higher education
establishments and to research units; by
funding Research Council establishments to
carry out research or provide facilities and
expertise in support of postgraduate study; and
by subscribing to international scientific
organisations. The other main sources of
finance for universities are the higher education
funding councils (see p. 428).
Strategy and Finance
Planned total government expenditure on
science, engineering and technology (both
civil and defence) in 1998-99 is £6,038
million. Of this £3,719 million is devoted to
civil science, including £1,338 million for the
Science Budget.
In July 1998, the Government announced
that it was providing an additional £1,000
million for the science and engineering base
between 1999 and 2002—£700 million
through the Science Budget and £300 million
through the Department for Education and
Employment. A further £400 million will be
provided by the Wellcome Trust. About £600
million of the extra funding, including £300
million of the Wellcome contribution, will be
devoted to uprating university laboratories
and other essential equipment, in response to
recommendations in the Dearing Report.
Another £400 million will be used by the
Research Councils to support research in
priority areas such as life sciences (including
genetic research, medical science and
biotechnology). The Wellcome Trust will
provide £100 million towards a new
synchrotron X-ray machine at the Daresbury
Laboratory (see p. 428) to keep the UK at the
forefront of genetic research.
Among government departments, the
Ministry of Defence (see p. 420) has the
largest research budget. The main civil
departments are the Department of Trade and
Industry (see p. 419), the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions (see
p. 421), the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food (see p. 421), and the Department of
Health (see p. 421).
The Foresight Programme
The funding and organisation of British
science, engineering and technology aims to
create a close partnership between
government, industry and the scientific
community in developing strengths in areas of
importance to the future economic well-being
of Britain. In particular, the Government’s
Foresight Programme encourages the public
and private sectors to work together to
identify opportunities in markets and
technologies likely to emerge over the next 10
to 20 years that would support sustainable
growth, and the actions needed to exploit
them. Government priorities in science,
engineering and technology programmes, and
in overall policy, regulation and education and
training, are being guided by the Programme.
The Foresight Programme is co-ordinated
by a joint industry/academic steering group
headed by the Chief Scientific Adviser. In
1995, the steering group identified six cross-
sectoral themes or priority areas:
• communications and computing power
(with very widespread applications);
• new organisms, products and processes
from genetics (with applications in
health, agriculture, food and
environmental protection);
• materials science, engineering and
technology;
• production processes and services;
• pollution monitoring and control
technologies, and technologies for
conserving energy and other resources;
and
• social trends (improving understanding
of human factors involved in markets and
scientific advance).
Sixteen sector panels, made up of people
from industry, academia and government,
examine opportunities in specific branches of
science, engineering and technology.
Government departments, universities and
higher education funding councils, as well as
the Research Councils, are reflecting
Foresight priorities in their research spending
allocations. The private sector is encouraged to
take account of the priorities both in its
participation in collaborative research
416
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
programmes and in its own strategic planning.
The Government is providing £30 million
over four years for the first round of the
Foresight Challenge Competition, to fund
collaborative R&D projects which address
priorities identified by the Foresight panels.
This is complemented by a further £62 million
from private sector project participants. In
addition, more than £300 million or so has
already been channelled into other Foresight
initiatives. The next round of work will begin
in April 1999; it will produce a new set of
visions and a fresh agenda for action.
EQUAL—Extend Quality Life
One of the principal issues facing the UK in
the years ahead is a growing elderly
population. Life expectancy has risen, but has
not been matched by an increase in years free
from disability. The purpose of the EQUAL
scheme is to focus research and develop
technologies to improve the quality of life of an
ageing population. It spans the activities of all
the Research Councils, from medical and life
sciences research to other areas such as social
and materials research, drawing together issues
identified in the Foresight Programme.
ROPA and CASE
The Realising Our Potential Award (ROPA)
scheme, administered by the Research
Councils, is designed to encourage academic
researchers to develop strategic links with
industry and to stimulate new areas of ‘blue
skies’ or ‘curiosity-driven’ research. To date,
the total value of ROPA awards amounts to
£109 million for more than 1,200 projects.
The Government also makes funds available
through the Research Councils for the Co¬
operative Awards in Science and Engineering
(CASE) scheme, which supports postgraduate
students on research projects jointly
supervised with industry.
LINK
The LINK scheme provides a government¬
wide framework for collaborative research in
support of sustainable growth and
improvement of the quality of life, in line with
Foresight priorities. It aims to promote
partnerships in commercially relevant research
projects between industry and higher
education institutions and other research base
organisations. Under the scheme, government
departments and Research Councils fund up
to 50% of the cost of research projects, with
industry providing the balance.
Since 1986, 58 LINK programmes have
supported more than 1,000 projects with a
total value of £430 million (over half of which
comes from industry) and involving 1,300
companies. Since 1995, 19 new programmes
have been announced in response to priorities
identified by the Foresight Programme. They
include a programme on sensors and sensor
systems for industrial applications; a
programme to promote sustainable production
of cereals and other arable crops (see box); and
the Foresight Vehicle programme (see box). In
addition, support is given to LINK projects in
priority areas outside the coverage of
conventional LINK programmes: for example,
through the Foresight LINK Awards and the
Innovative Manufacturing Initiative, which
has 111 active projects worth nearly £80
million in total, of which 58% is being
financed by industry.
Smart-Small Firms Award for Research and
Technology
Following a review of government support for
R&D by small businesses, a new locally
operated single Smart scheme, which reflects
Foresight Programme objectives, was
introduced in England in 1997. Financial
assistance is available for feasibility studies into
innovative technology (up to £45,000 for
independent firms with fewer than 50
employees) and for development up to
prototype stage of new products and processes
involving a significant technological advance (in
most cases, up to 200,000 ECUs for
independent businesses with fewer than 250
employees). Business Links (see p. 438) have an
important role in generating suitable R&D
projects, helping firms to submit applications
for Smart Awards and ensuring assisted projects
are fully exploited commercially. Smart

The Government is contributing £5
million to a LINK research programme
concerned with promoting sustainable
production of cereals and other arable
crops. It is being supported by MAFF,
The Scottish Office, the DETR and the
BBSRC, in conjunction with industry.
Priority research areas include ‘precision
farming’; alternative methods of pest,
disease and weed control; sustainable soil
management systems; and control of
resistance to pesticides.
The Foresight Vehicle LINK
programme is designed to encourage the
development of technologies for use in
mass-market vehicles. To qualify for
funding, research should be conducted on
developing lightweight vehicles which are
environmentally friendly, make best use of
limited fuel resources, can ‘communicate’
with other vehicles and the transport
infrastructure, and are safe and able to
avoid collisions.
Sanyx International of Northern Ireland
won a 1997 Smart Award to design a
highly efficient, reliable, low-cost water
purification system. It is hoped that the
resulting product will be used to help

to treat biologically contaminated water.
universities to help them in the early stages of
turning research into commercial products.
Under this scheme to marshal £50 million in
seed capital for this purpose, the Government
is contributing £20 million, the Wellcome
Trust up to £18 million and the Gatsby
Charitable Foundation £2 million, with the
remainder to be raised by the universities
themselves, where possible in partnership
with the private sector. Universities, in
partnership with other institutions if
appropriate, can bid for funds from the
scheme to enable them to set up their own
seed funds.
Foresight Awards were introduced in 1998 to
recognise Smart winners who have displayed
exceptional vision in developing and applying
new technology and creating new market
opportunities. Separate Smart schemes are
operated in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
Joint Research Equipment Initiative
The Joint Research Equipment Initiative
brings together the higher education
funding councils, the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland and the
Research Councils. It directs funds for
research equipment in strategic priority
areas. In January 1998, 250 awards provided
almost £80 million of public and private
money for ‘leading edge’ equipment for UK
universities and colleges.
University Challenge Fund
The University Challenge Fund is a new
competitive scheme which offers financing to
Partnership Prizes
These are awarded yearly to academic units
which have made the most significant
contribution to helping sustain a thriving
economy by forging closer links with industry.
In 1998, the first prize for science went to the
Department of Chemistry at Imperial College,
London, and the first prize for engineering to
the Centre for Communications Systems
Research at the University of Surrey.
Public Awareness
The Government seeks to raise the status of
science, engineering and technology among
the general public, by increasing awareness of
their contribution to the UK’s economic
wealth and quality of life. Raising awareness is
important in encouraging young people to
pursue careers in science and engineering. To
this end, the Government supports activities
such as the annual science festival of the
British Association for the Advancement of
Science (BAAS) and the National Week of
Science, Engineering and Technology. The
418
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
fifth of these Weeks, held in March 1998,
consisted of 7,000 events held all over the UK,
attracting 1.2 million visitors. The Committee
on the Public Understanding of Science
(COPUS), set up by the Royal Society, the
BAAS and the Royal Institution (see p. 429),
acts as a co-ordinator for those fostering
public understanding and promotes best
practice in the field.
Science festivals are also a growing feature
of local co-operative efforts to further
understanding of the contribution made by
science to everyday life. Schools, museums,
laboratories, higher education institutions and
industry contribute to a variety of special
events. The longest-established single location
science festival is the annual Edinburgh
International Science Festival, which
celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1998, when
it included 250 events and attracted about
150,000 visitors.
Role of Women
The Development Unit for Women in
Science, Engineering and Technology was set
up in the OST in 1994 in response to a report
which found that women were still under¬
represented in the science, engineering and
technology sectors, especially at senior levels.
The Unit has highlighted the benefits to
business of providing a working environment
sensitive to the needs of women scientists and
engineers who combine a career and family
responsibilities. It seeks to ensure that careers
information for girls and women is widely
available and to promote good employment
practices, such as the provision of childcare
facilities, job sharing, flexible working and
career breaks.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
In 1998-99 DTFs planned expenditure on
science, engineering and technology is £316
million, including £80 million on technology
transfer and access. This covers innovation
and technology, aeronautics, space (see p.
422), and nuclear and non-nuclear energy. In
supporting these activities, DTI’s overall aim
is to work in partnership with business, the
science and technology base, the education
sector, other government departments and
interested organisations, to bring about
improved innovation performance across the
whole range of business sectors, and to help
companies to compete more efficiently in
global markets.
For the DTI, innovation frequently
involves not only a commitment to R&D and
the adoption or adaptation of new and existing
technologies, but also the improvement of
other aspects of business, including finance,
marketing, design, management of people and
people skills. Through its Innovation Unit, a
mixed team of seconded industrialists and
government officials, DTI seeks to encourage
and facilitate business, education, the media,
government and the general public to adopt
innovation as a vital contribution to improved
performance, international competitiveness
and sustainable growth. In Northern Ireland
the Industrial Research and Technology Unit
has a similar role to that of the DTI,
supporting industrial R&D, technology
transfer and innovation.
Technology and Knowledge Transfer
The DTI aims to increase the number and
quality of partnerships between the science,
engineering and technology base and industry;
improve access to sources of technology and
technological expertise; improve the capacity
of industry to use technology effectively; and
increase the uptake of the latest technology
and best practice techniques.
One example of a technology transfer
programme is TCS (formerly known as the
Teaching Company Scheme), which has 11
government department and Research Council
sponsors. At any one time, nearly 700 TCS
programmes are operating, each involving one
or more graduates carrying out a project to
transfer technology to a company. Typically, a
TCS programme will last for two years and
will be jointly supervised by academic
specialists and company staff. There are 20
TCS Centres for Small Firms, which are
involved in around 90% of TCS programmes.
The Centres are designed to make it easier for
small firms to use TCS. The graduate ‘TCS

Aeronautics
The DTFs Civil Aircraft Research and
Technology Demonstration Programme
(CARAD) supports research and technology
demonstration in aeronautics (see p. 483). In
1998-99, the CARAD budget is £21.7
million. The programme is an essential part of
a national aeronautics research effort, with
almost half of the supported research work
being conducted in industry, and around a
third at the Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (DERA—see below), and universities
and other research organisations receiving
about 10% of funding. The remainder
represents the UK’s contribution (shared with
MoD) to the European Transonic Windtunnel
in Cologne. CARAD and earlier programmes
have supported a range of projects, including:
aluminium and composite airframe materials;
compressors, turbines, noise and emissions in
engines; and modular avionics technologies.
They have helped Rolls-Royce to increase its
share of the large civil engine market (see
p. 484), and British Aerospace has become
Europe’s foremost designer and manufacturer
of wings for large civil aircraft.
In November 1997 and February 1998 the
DTI announced private/public investments of
up to £323 million in Rolls-Royce and British
Aerospace for next-generation product
development.
Measurement Standards
The DTI finances the maintenance and
development of new measurement standards
under the National Measurement System
(NMS—see p. 440) and materials metrology
programmes. Most of the work is carried out
at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL),
the Laboratory of the Government Chemist
(LGC) and the National Engineering
Laboratory (NEL). Spending about £38
million a year (excluding VAT), the NMS
provides the infrastructure to ensure that
measurements can be made on a consistent
basis throughout the UK. The accelerating
The Private Finance Initiative (see p. 392)
is being used to provide new serviced
accommodation for the National Physical
Laboratory. The £82 million laboratory,
due to be completed by February 2001,
will be one of the most advanced facilities
of its kind in the world.
Ministry of Defence (MoD)
The MoD has the largest government
research budget—£2,336 million for 1998—99,
of which about £500 million is for medium-
and long-term applied research relevant to
military needs. Since the end of the Cold War,
the Government has been committed to
achieving a gradual reduction in real terms in
spending on defence R&D.
The Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (DERA) is the largest single scientific
employer in the UK. Its role is to supply
scientific and technical services primarily to
the MoD but also to other government
departments. DERA has set up five dual-use
(civil-military) technology centres in subjects
ranging from structural materials to high-
performance computing, to enhance the
degree of collaboration between DERA,
industry and the academic science base.
An Airbus Industrie-sponsored trial, using
a ground-based laser to measure the wake
vortex left behind Airbus airliners, was
completed by DERA in Toulouse, France,
in March 1998. Wake vortices are one factor
determining aircraft separation at airports;
it is essential that aircraft avoid flying
directly into the wake vortex of aircraft
flying ahead of them. The aim is to ensure
that the shape of the wing, and its slat and
flap settings, cause as little wake as possible.
420
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
DERA subcontracts research to industry
and universities, so that their know-how can
be harnessed to meeting military
requirements. It also works closely with
industry to ensure that scientific and
technological advances are integrated at an
early stage into development and production.
This technology transfer is not just confined
to the defence industry but has also led to
important ‘spin-offs’ into civil markets, in
fields ranging from new materials and
electronic devices to advanced aerodynamics.
The latter in particular has helped to give the
UK a leading role in civil aircraft design.
Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR)
The DETR funds research in several broad
policy areas: environmental protection,
including water, radioactive substances,
chemicals and environmental technology;
planning and the countryside; local
government; housing; construction;
transport congestion; the environmental
impact of transport; transport safety and
security; and mobility for elderly and
disabled people. Some of the biggest
programmes are those on pollution-related
climate change, regional and urban air
quality, construction, best practice in
energy efficiency and primary and
secondary safety of transport users.
Total expenditure for 1998-99 is £150
million, including for the Environment
Agency, Highways Agency, Maritime and
Coastguard Agency, and the Health and
Safety Executive. British scientific
expertise is being made available in
developing countries to protect threatened

Darwin Initiative (see pp. 325-6).
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food (MAFF)
MAFF co-ordinates its research programme
with the other home country agricultural
departments and the Research Councils. The
programme reflects the Ministry’s wide-
ranging responsibilities for protecting the
public, especially in food safety and quality;
protecting and enhancing the rural and marine
environment; flooding and coastal defence;
animal health and welfare; and improving the
economic performance of the agriculture,
fishing and food industries.
The budget for research expenditure in
1998-99 is £142 million, including support for
the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (see p. 430).
Research is contracted increasingly through
open competition among Research Councils,
the Ministry’s agencies, non-departmental
public bodies, higher education institutions
and other organisations.
Continuing priority will be given by
MAFF to research on BSE and scrapie.
New research is being undertaken into on-
farm food safety (e-coli); implementing the
Krebs Review recommendations on
tuberculosis and badgers; and organic
farming.
Department of Health (DoH)
The DoH’s R&D strategy aims to provide the
evidence needed as the basis for policy and
practice in public health, healthcare and social
care. It delivers this objective through two
complementary programmes: the Policy
Research Programme (PRP), and the National
Health Service R&D Programme. The DoH
also oversees the research programmes of the
health-related non-departmental public
bodies. It will spend about £63 million in
1998—99 (£27 million of which will be on the
PRP). In addition, NHS research and related
expenditure is expected to be £427 million in
1998-99.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Tackling inequalities in health is one of the
Government’s top priorities (see p. 186).
Eight research projects have been
commissioned under the Department’s health
inequalities research programme: these focus
particularly on children and young people.
Department for International
Development (DFID)
DFID commissions and sponsors technology
development and research through ‘knowledge
budgets’ within its six advisory divisions:
Natural Resources; Engineering; Health and
Population; Education; Economics; and Social
Development. Provision for knowledge
generation in 1998—99 is £99 million, which
funds projects relevant to geographical regions
designated as the primary targets of the UK’s
aid programme, and of benefit to the poorest
people in those countries. Bilateral
programmes also commission country-specific
knowledge projects.
DFID also contributes to international
centres and programmes generating
knowledge aimed at solving problems faced by
developing countries. These contributions
include support for the EU Science and
Technology for Development programme,
which sponsors research in renewable natural
resources, agriculture, health and information
technologies.
The Scottish Office
The annual value of government-financed
(non-military) research in Scotland is about
£321 million. Some £141 million goes to
Scottish research institutions from British
bodies, mainly the Research Councils. Around
£79 million is administratively controlled by
The Scottish Office. In many areas—medicine,
agriculture and biological sciences, fisheries and
marine science—public sector research in
Scotland has an international reputation.
The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department encourages the
development of science-based industry, for
example, by promoting and administering
government and EU industrial R&D schemes.
The enterprise network in Scotland—Scottish
Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise
and LECs (see chapter 26)—addresses the
need for innovation and technology transfer,
both through grant support for product and
process innovation and through a wide range
of initiatives. In 1996, Scottish Enterprise,
together with the Royal Society of Edinburgh
(see p. 429), launched the Technology
Ventures Initiative, which aims to improve the
exploitation of research in Scotland.
Space Activities
The UK’s civil space programme is brought
together through the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership of government
departments and the Research Councils.
BNSC’s key aims are to develop practical and
economic uses of space, to promote the
competitiveness of British space companies in
world markets and to maintain the UK’s
position in space science. These are realised
primarily by collaboration with other
European nations through the European
Space Agency (ESA).
Through BNSC, the Government spends
around £200 million a year on space activities.
About two-thirds of this is channelled through
ESA for collaborative programmes on Earth
observation, telecommunications and space
science, much of which returns to the UK
through contracts awarded to British industry.
In March 1998 the Government announced a
£21 million package of investments in three
ESA programmes: ARTES-3 (Advanced
Research in Telecommunications Systems);
the ERS-2 (European Remote Sensing)
programme; and EOPP (Earth Observation
Preparatory Programme). The remaining
third of the space budget is spent on
international meteorological programmes
carried out through the European
Meteorological Satellite Organisation
(EUMETSAT) and the national programme,
which is aimed at complementing R&D
supported through ESA.
Around half of the UK space programme is
concerned with satellite-based Earth
observation (remote-sensing) for commercial
and environmental applications. The UK’s
important contribution to ESA’s ERS-1 and
ERS-2 satellites, which were launched in 1991
and 1995, included two of the instruments on

second, an Along Track Scanning Radiometer,
measures global sea surface temperature to a
very high degree of accuracy.
The UK is also a major contributor to ESA’s
latest Earth observation satellite, ENVISAT,
due to be launched in 1999. This will carry a
new generation of radar and radiometer
systems as well as other scientific
environmental instruments, some of which
have been either designed or constructed in
Britain. The complete satellite is being
assembled at a purpose-built factory in Bristol,
operated by the UK-French space company,
Matra Marconi Space. British companies are
also leading the development of microsatellites.
Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, based at the
University of Surrey, and Satellite Innovations
Ltd, have both developed and successfully
launched scientific and commercial
microsatellites for British and overseas
customers.
A quarter of the UK’s space budget is
devoted to space science, in support of
astronomy, planetary science and geophysics.
Contributions have been made to missions
ranging from the Hubble Space Telescope to
the Ulysses solar space probe. The UK is
contributing substantially to the SOHO
mission to study the Sun; to the Infrared
Space Observatory, which is investigating the
birth and death of stars (see box); and to the
Cassini Huygens mission, a seven-year
programme to send a probe to Saturn and its
moon Titan, launched in 1997. It is also
participating in XMM, ESA’s 1999 X-ray
spectroscopy mission, which will investigate
X-ray emissions from black holes.
The UK is taking a leading role in the
largest current international project in
ground-based astronomy. The Gemini project
involves building two 8 m telescopes at Mauna
Kea (Hawaii) and Cerro Pachon (Chile), due
to be completed respectively in 1999 and 2001.
The other partners are the United States,
Canada, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The UK
has a 25% stake in the work, with major
responsibility for the primary mirror support
system and much of the control software.
ESA’s Infrared Space Observatory (ISO),
launched in 1995, has been one of the most
successful space observatories. A new view
of the Universe has been developed as a
result of the work of ISO, which has
discovered hitherto unseen stars, galaxies
and black holes, and also revealed water in
the deserts of space. Because ISO operates
in the infrared, it can see through dust
clouds, which obscure the vision of optical
telescopes. A team of scientists from
Imperial College, London, has detected
galaxies glowing with infrared rays but
unseen by visible light. Some of the objects
discovered date from when the Universe
was only a third of its present age.
When the ISO spacecraft sent back its last
data in April 1998, it had already exceeded
its expected 18-month lifetime by almost
another year. However, the mission has not
ended there—scientists expect to continue
studying ISO data for many years to come.
The UK has many bilateral agreements for
scientific research with other countries, such
as Russia, Japan and the United States. For
example, British scientists developed the
widefield camera for ROSAT (the German,
British and US X-ray satellite).
Another major area of British space
expertise is satellite communications and
navigation. In Europe, the UK is both a
leading producer and user of satellite
communications technology (see p. 485). It is
taking a leading role in preparations for future
ESA satellite communications missions,
including ARTEMIS, which will provide
important communications links for the
ENVISAT programme. The UK is also
contributing to the development of a global
navigation satellite system within Europe,
which will augment the United States GPS
system to provide increased accuracy and
reliability for civil aviation global navigation.
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
European Union
Since 1984 the EU has operated a series of
R&D framework programmes, across a range
423
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
of disciplines and sectors, to strengthen the
scientific and technological basis of European
industry and support the development of EU
policies. The Fourth Framework Programme,
which runs until the end of 1998, provides
funds for international collaborative research
in fields such as biotechnology, industrial
materials and information technology. More
than half of all projects include British
participation, which is particularly strong in
biomedicine, agriculture, transport, and social
and economic research.
Negotiations over the Fifth Framework
Programme, which is expected to run from the
beginning of 1999 to 2002, are nearing
completion. It will focus on multidisciplinary
research targeted at tackling pressing
European problems, such as land transport,
marine technology and the ‘city of tomorrow’.
Other International Activities
Over 800 UK organisations have taken part in
EUREKA, an industry-led scheme to
encourage European co-operation in
developing and producing advanced products
and processes with worldwide sales potential.
There are 26 members of EUREKA,
including the 15 EU countries and the
European Commission. Around 660 projects
are in progress, involving some 3,000 firms,
universities and research organisations. One
British-led project is concerned with
developing glass-reinforced polymers that
could replace steel in vehicle suspensions,
leading to the production of more comfortable
and more fuel-efficient cars which would
cause less damage to road surfaces.
The COST programme (European Co¬
operation in the field of Science and Technical
research) encourages co-operation in national
research activities across Europe, with
participants from industry, academia and
research laboratories. Transport,
telecommunications and materials have
traditionally been the largest areas supported.
New areas include physics, chemistry,
neuroscience and the application of
biotechnology to agriculture, including
forestry. There are 28 member states and the
UK takes part in almost all of about 130
current COST actions.
Other examples of international
collaboration include the European Space
Agency (see p. 422), and CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics, based in
Geneva, where the proposed Large Hadron
Collider is due to be completed by 2005.
Scientific programmes at CERN aim to test,
verify and develop the ‘standard model’ of the
origins and structure of the universe. There
are 19 member states. The UK’s programme is
co-ordinated through the CCLRC and the
subscription is paid by the PPARC.
Contributions to the high-flux neutron source
at the Institut Laue-Langevin and the
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility,
both in Grenoble, are paid by the EPSRC.
The PPARC is a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility within the
Arctic Circle, which conducts research on the
ionosphere. The NERC has a major
involvement in international programmes of
research into global climate change organised
through the World Climate Research
Programme and the International Geosphere-
Biosphere Programme. It also supports the
UK’s subscription to the Ocean Drilling
Program.
Through the MRC, the UK participates in
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL), based in Heidelberg, Germany. The
European Bioinformatics Institute, an
outstation of the EMBL, is based at Hinxton,
near Cambridge, and provides up-to-date
information on molecular biology and genome
sequencing for researchers throughout
Europe. The MRC pays Britain’s
contribution to the Human Frontier Science
Programme, which supports international
collaborative research into brain function and
biological function through molecular level
approaches. It also pays Britain’s subscription
to the International Agency for Cancer
Research.
The UK is a member of the science and
technology committees of such international
organisations as the OECD and NATO, and
of various specialised agencies of the United
Nations, including UNESCO. The Research
Councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy are members of the European
Science Foundation, and a number of British
scientists are involved in its initiatives.
424
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
The British Government also enters into
bilateral agreements with other governments
to encourage closer collaboration in science,
engineering and technology. Staff in British
Embassies, High Commissions and British
Council offices (see below) conduct
government business on, and promote
contacts in, science, engineering and
technology between the UK and overseas
countries; and help to inform a large number
of organisations in the UK about science,
engineering and technology developments
and initiatives overseas. There are science
and technology sections in British Missions
in Paris, Tokyo, Washington, Beijing
(Peking), Bonn, Moscow, Pretoria, Seoul,
Rome, Sao Paulo and Ottawa, and many
British Council offices have designated
Science Officer posts.
The British Council (see p. 94) promotes
better understanding and knowledge of the
UK, including its scientific and technological
achievements. As well as supplying
information on science and science policy, it
fosters co-operation in research, training and
education through, for example, exchange of
specialists. The Council also identifies and
manages technological, scientific and
educational projects in developing countries.
The Research Councils maintain, with the
British Council, a joint office in Brussels to
promote UK participation in European
research programmes.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each Research Council is an autonomous body
established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industry and
government. The Councils support research,
study and training in universities and other
higher education institutions, and carry out or
support research, through their own institutes
and at international research centres, often
jointly with other public sector bodies and
international organisations. They provide
awards to about 15,000 postgraduate students
in science, social sciences, engineering and
technology. In addition to funding from the
OST, the Councils receive income from
research commissioned by government
departments and the private sector; such
income is particularly important for the
BBSRC, NERC and CCLRC.
In July 1998, the EPSRC signed a six-year
contract on behalf of the Research
Councils for a £26 million Private Finance
Initiative supercomputing service, which
will provide access to the most powerful
computer for academic research in Europe.
The computer will be installed at the
University of Manchester. It will be able to
make 700,000 million calculations a
second, enabling scientists to model, for
example, ocean currents and their
interaction with the atmosphere, leading to
a better understanding of phenomena such
as El Nino.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC)
The EPSRC, the Research Council with the
largest budget (£383 million in 1998—99) has
responsibility for developing and sustaining
basic, strategic and applied research in
engineering and the physical sciences. Its remit
is delivered through eight programme areas:
physics, chemistry and mathematics, the
generic technologies of information technology
and materials, and three engineering
programmes. The latter comprise general
engineering (concentrating on strengthening
the health of the engineering disciplines),
engineering for manufacturing (enhancing
industrial competitiveness), and engineering
for infrastructure, the environment and
healthcare (improving quality of life).
In 1997 the EPSRC launched four pilot
Faraday Partnerships, each with initial funding
of up to £50,000 (for running costs) and
additional funding of up to £1 million for
specific collaborative research and training. The
partnerships aim to improve the links between
the research base and industry, particularly
small and medium-sized enterprises. Areas
covered in the pilot partnerships are: products
comprising interdependent mechanical and
electronic parts; enhanced packaging
425
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
technology; intelligent sensors for control
technologies; and 3D multimedia applications
and technology integration.
Medical Research Council (MRC)
The MRC, with an overall budget of £309
million for 1998-99, is the main source of public
funds for biomedical and related sciences
research. It supports research and training aimed
at maintaining and improving human health.
The MRC advances knowledge and technology
to meet the needs of user communities,
including the providers of healthcare and the
biotechnology, food, healthcare, medical
instrumentation, pharmaceutical and other
biomedical-related industries. About half the
MRC’s expenditure is allocated to its own
institutes and units, the rest going mainly on
grant support of research in universities,
including training awards. The Council has two
large institutes—the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill in London and
the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
Cambridge; it also runs the Clinical Sciences
Centre at the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School, London. It has more than 40 research
units and a number of smaller scientific teams.
Research supported by the MRC is
conducted in seven broad areas:
• macromolecules, cells, and development
biology (21% of the MRC’s research and
training spend);
• infections, immunity and inflammation
(including basic studies of disease-
causing organisms, the function and
development of the immune system,
autoimmune diseases, vaccination, and
antibiotics) (21%);
• neurosciences and mental health (19%);
• genetic blueprint and health (including
human genome mapping, structure and
function of genes, gene therapy and
genetic diagnosis and screening) (15%);
• organ systems and cancer (including
heart disease and stroke, ageing, diabetes,
reproduction, the musculo-skeletal
system, as well as cancer) (14%);
• health services and public health research
(6%); and
• nutrition, chemicals, radiation and
trauma (including toxicology,
environmental toxins, nutritional and
lifestyle effects on health, and factors
influencing healthy growth and
development) (4%).
Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council (PPARC)
The main task of the PPARC, which has a
budget of £191 million for 1998—99, is to
sustain and develop basic research into
fundamental physical processes. Its three main
areas of research are:
• particle physics—theoretical and
experimental research into elementary
particles and the fundamental forces of
nature;
• astronomy (including cosmology and
astrophysics)—the origin, structure and
evolution of the Universe, stars and
galaxies; and
• planetary science (including solar and
terrestrial physics)—the origin and
evolution of the solar system and the
influence of the Sun on planetary bodies,
particularly Earth.
The PPARC provides research and training
grants to universities, and access to major
facilities including observatories on La Palma
in the Canary Islands and on Hawaii. In 1998,
it formed the UK Astronomy Technology
Centre in Edinburgh to take over the
functions of the former Royal Observatory
Edinburgh and the Royal Greenwich
Observatory at Cambridge.
The Council is responsible for the UK’s
contributions to international collaborations,
including the European Space Agency and
CERN (see pp. 422 and 424).
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC)
The BBSRC has a budget of £186 million for
1998-99. It supports basic and strategic
research and research training related to the
understanding and exploitation of biological
426
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
systems, which underpin the agriculture,
bioprocessing, chemical, food, healthcare,
pharmaceutical and other biotechnology-
related industries. The scientific themes are
biomolecular sciences; genes and
developmental biology; biochemistry and cell
biology; plant and microbial sciences; animal
sciences; agrifood; and engineering and
biological systems. As well as funding research
in universities and other research centres
throughout the UK, the BBSRC sponsors
eight research institutes.
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC)
The NERC is principally concerned with the
themes of sustainable development,
environmental protection, and the quality of
life. In 1998-99 it will spend most of its
budget of £172 million in the following areas:
biodiversity; environmental risks and hazards;
global change; natural resource management;
and pollution and waste.
The Council supports research in its own
and other research establishments as well as
research and training in universities. It also
provides a range of facilities for use by the
wider environmental science community,
including a marine research fleet. NERC
establishments include the British Geological
Survey, the British Antarctic Survey, the
The NERC’s URGENT programme,
established in 1996, is a major seven-year
£10 million initiative of urban
environmental research integrating
geological, terrestrial, freshwater and
atmospheric sciences. It is designed to help
solve urban environmental problems
which threaten ecosystems and the health
of inhabitants, inhibit redevelopment and
diminish the quality of life. Two key
objectives are to evaluate the size of
problems and risks and to devise strategies
for remediation and management of
derelict sites. Academic researchers work
in partnership with city authorities,
industry, financiers and regulatory bodies.
Centre for Coastal and Marine Sciences and
the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
together with a number of university-based
units. The Southampton Oceanography
Centre, a joint venture with Southampton
University, undertakes research, training and
support activities in oceanography, geology
and aspects of marine technology and
engineering. The NERC’s Research Vessel
Services are located at the Centre.
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC)
The ESRC, with an R&D provision of £66
million for 1998-99, supports research and
training to meet the needs of its users and to
enhance the UK’s economic competitiveness,
quality of life, and the effectiveness of public
services and policy. All research funded by the
ESRC is conducted in higher education
institutions or independent research
establishments. The Council has nine priority
themes: economic performance and
development; environment and sustainability;
globalisation, regions and emerging markets;
governance, regulation and accountability;
technology and people; innovation;
knowledge, communication and learning;
lifespan, lifestyles and health; and social
inclusion and exclusion.
The Council has recently launched three
new Centres: for the Study of Knowledge,
Skills and Organisational Performance; for the
Analysis of Social Exclusion; and for the
Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation.
New Research Programmes commissioned
include Cities: Competitiveness and Cohesion;
Understanding the Evolving Macroeconomy;
the Changing Nature of Work and
Employment; Democracy and Participation;
the Virtual Society; and Violence; and a joint
programme with the Higher Education
Funding Council for England to promote
effective teaching and learning.
Council for the Central Laboratory of the
Research Councils (CCLRC)
The CCLRC promotes scientific and
engineering research by supplying facilities
and technical expertise primarily to meet the
427
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
needs of the other Research Councils. Its
R&D budget for 1998-99 is £110 million, of
which £86 million comes through agreements
with other Research Councils and the
remaining £24 million from contracts and
agreements with the EU, overseas countries,
and other industries and organisations. It
covers a broad range of science and
technology, including materials and
biomolecular science using accelerators and
lasers, satellite instrumentation and data
processing, remote-sensing, electronics, sensor
technology, computing and informatics,
micro-engineering and particle physics.
The CCLRC is responsible for three
research establishments: the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory at Chilton in Oxfordshire;
the Daresbury Laboratory near Warrington in
Cheshire; and the Chilbolton Observatory in
Hampshire. These centres provide facilities too
large or complex to be housed by individual
academic institutions. Among the facilities are
ISIS (the world’s leading source of pulsed
neutrons and muons), some of the world’s
brightest lasers and the United Kingdom
Synchrotron Radiation Source.
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
Universities carry out most of the UK’s long¬
term strategic and basic research in science
and technology. The Higher Education
Funding Councils in England, Scotland and
Wales (see p. 141) provide the main general
funds to support research in universities and
other higher education institutions in Great
Britain. These funds pay for the salaries of
permanent academic staff, who usually teach
as well as undertake research, and contribute
to the infrastructure for research. The quality
of research performance is a key element in
the allocation of funding. In Northern Ireland
institutions are funded by the Department of
Education for Northern Ireland.
Basic and strategic research in higher
education institutions are also financed by the
Research Councils. Institutions undertaking
research with the support of Research Council
grants have the rights over the commercial
exploitation of their research, subject to the
prior agreement of the sponsoring Research
Council. They may make use of technology
transfer experts and other specialists to help
exploit and license the results of their
research. The other main channels of support
are industry, charities, government
departments and the European Union.
Institutions are expected to recover the full
cost of commissioned research. The high
quality of research in higher education
institutions, and their marketing skills, have
enabled them to attract more funding from a
larger range of external sources, especially in
contract income from industry and charities.
In April 1998 the University of Leicester
opened the first stage of a £46 million
National Space Science Centre. The
Centre accommodates the university’s
astronomy and Earth observation science
research programmes, and provides
education and leisure services related to
space science for the general public.
Science Parks
Science parks are partnerships between higher
education or research centres and industry to
promote commercially focused research and
advanced technology. There are around 55
such parks, hosting more than 1,400
companies. The majority are engaged in
computing, biotechnology, chemicals,
electrical engineering and robotics.
Technology transfer and R&D are the most
common activities. A growing number of
universities offer industry interdisciplinary
research centres, with exploitable resources.
These include access to analytical equipment,
library facilities and worldwide databases as
well as academic expertise.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Industrial Research and Technology
Organisations (RTOs)
RTOs are independent organisations carrying
out commercially relevant research and other
services on behalf of industry, often relating to
a specific industrial sector. The UK has the
largest RTO sector in Europe, consisting of
428
SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
around 50 organisations, which together
employ almost 10,000 people.
Charitable Organisations
Medical research charities are a major source
of funds for biomedical research in the UK.
Their combined contribution in 1998-99 was
about £440 million. The three largest were
from the Wellcome Trust, the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund and the Cancer
Research Campaign.
Professional Institutions
There are numerous technical institutions,
professional associations and learned societies
in the UK, many of which promote their own
disciplines or the education and professional
well-being of their members. The Council of
Science and Technology Institutes has ten
member institutes representing biology,
biochemistry, chemistry, environment, food
science and technology, geology, hospital
physics and physics.
The Engineering Council promotes the
study of all types of engineering in schools and
other organisations, in co-operation with its
150 industry affiliates, which include large
private sector companies and government
departments. Together with 38 professional
engineering institutions, the Council accredits
courses in higher education institutions. It also
advises the Government on academic,
industrial and professional issues.
Royal Society
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, is the
UK’s academy of science and has 1,189
Fellows and 100 Foreign Members. Many of
its Fellows serve on governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with
research. The Society has a dual role, as the
national academy of science and as the
provider of a range of services, including
research fellowships and grants, for the
scientific community. It offers independent
advice to government on science matters, acts
as a forum for discussion of scientific issues
and fosters public awareness of science and
science education. Its government grant for
1998-99 is £22.5 million.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering,
which has 1,090 Fellows and 74 Foreign
Members. It promotes excellence in
engineering for the benefit of society, and
advises government, Parliament and other
official organisations. The Academy’s
programmes are aimed at attracting first-class
students into engineering, raising awareness of
the importance of engineering design among
undergraduates, developing links between
industry and higher education, and increasing
industrial investment in engineering research
in higher education institutions. It has a
government grant of £3.4 million in 1998—99.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
offering postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and
publishing journals. It has been engaged with
Scottish Enterprise in developing a strategy to
increase the extent of commercial use of the
products of the Scottish research base (see
p. 422), and has been active in the Foresight
process. It also acts as a source of independent
scientific advice to the Government and others.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments by means of lectures
and publications for specialists and
schoolchildren. Of these, the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, founded in
1831, is mainly concerned with science, while
the Royal Society of Arts, dating from 1754,
deals with the arts and commerce as well as
science. The Royal Institution, which was
founded in 1799, also performs these functions
and runs its own research laboratories.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London (ZSL), an
independent conservation, science and
429
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
education charity founded in 1826, runs
London Zoo, which occupies about 15 hectares
(36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London. It also
owns and runs Whipsnade Wild Animal Park
(243 hectares/600 acres) in Bedfordshire. The
ZSL is responsible for the Institute of Zoology,
which carries out research in support of
conservation. The Institute’s work covers
topics such as ecology, behaviour, reproductive
biology and conservation genetics. The ZSL
also operates in overseas conservation projects,
and is concerned with practical field
conservation, primarily in East and Southern
Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia.
Other well-known zoos in the UK include
those in Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley
and Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in
1759, covers 121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew in
south-west London and a 187-hectare (462-
acre) estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, in
West Sussex. They contain one of the largest
collections of living and dried plants in the
world. Research is conducted into all aspects of
plant life, including physiology, biochemistry,
genetics, economic botany and the conservation
of habitats and species. In 1998-99 Kew is
building the Millennium Seed Bank, containing
the world’s most comprehensive collection of
seeds of flowering plants, at Wakehurst Place.
The Millennium Commission is donating up to
£30 million towards the estimated £75-£80
million cost of the project. Staff are also active
in programmes to reintroduce endangered plant
species to the wild. Kew participates in joint
research programmes in some 52 countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh
was originally established in 1670, and is
the national botanic garden of Scotland.
Together with its three associated specialist
gardens, which were acquired to provide a
range of different climatic and soil conditions,
it has become an internationally recognised
centre for taxonomy (classification of species);
for the conservation and study of living and
preserved plants and fungi; and as a provider
of horticultural education.
A national botanic garden and research
centre for Wales is to be developed on a 230-
hectare (570-acre) site on the Middleton Hall
estate at Llandeilo, near Swansea. The £43
million project is backed by a consortium of
public and private organisations and
individuals. It has been awarded £21.7 million
by the Millennium Commission.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum has 68 million
specimens, ranging from a blue whale skeleton
to minute insects. It is one of the world’s
principal centres for research into natural
history, offering an advisory service to
institutions all over the world. The Science
Museum promotes understanding of the history
of science, technology, industry and medicine.
Its extensive collection of scientific instruments
and machinery is complemented by interactive
computer games and audio-visual equipment
for visitors to use. In this way, the museum
explains scientific principles to the general
public and documents the history of science,
from early discoveries to space-age technology.
These two museums are in South Kensington,
London. Other important collections include
those at the Museum of Science & Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of
Science in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish
Museum, Edinburgh.

of Industry
A successful, competitive industrial sector, based on a close partnership
between business, consumers and government, is the key to the UK’s sustained
growth. The Government’s central economic objective is to achieve high and
stable growth and employment by working with businesses to create the right
framework for enterprise and investment. Part of its initiative on
competitiveness is new legislation prohibiting anti-competitive agreements
and abuse of market power.
STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION
Financial and other services now contribute
around two-thirds of the country’s gross value
added, compared with less than one-third
provided by manufacturing, construction,
energy and agriculture. In some sectors, a
small number of large companies and their
subsidiaries are responsible for a substantial
proportion of total production, for instance in
the chemical, pharmaceutical, motor vehicle
assembly and aerospace industries. About 250
British industrial companies each have an
annual turnover of over £500 million.
Small firms with fewer than 100 staff
account for over 50% of the private sector
workforce. At the start of 1997 there were an
estimated 3.7 million businesses in the UK,
including about 2.5 million sole traders.
Industries with the fastest growth rates in
recent years are in the services sector,
particularly finance, property, and
professional and business services. Inward
investment continues to contribute to the
growth of new companies and jobs throughout
the UK; the cumulative value of direct inward
investment into Britain rose from £52,000
million in 1986 to over £170,000 million in
1997 (see p. 406).
Legal Framework
All British companies are registered with the
Registrar of Companies. Companies with a
place of business or branch in the UK, but
which are incorporated overseas, are also
required to register. Legislation deals with
capital structure, rights and duties of directors
and members and the preparation and filing of
accounts. Most corporate businesses are
‘limited liability’ companies. The liability of
members of a limited company is restricted to
contributing an amount related to their
shareholding (or to their guarantee where
companies are limited by guarantee). In the
case of unincorporated businesses, such as sole
proprietorships or partnerships, individuals
are personally liable for any business debts,
except where a member of a partnership is a
limited liability company or a limited member
of a limited partnership. A draft Bill to make

Companies may be either public or private.
A company must satisfy certain conditions
before it can become a public limited company
(pic). It must:
• be limited by shares or guarantee and
have a share capital;
• state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company;
• meet specified minimum capital
requirements; and
• have as the suffix to its name the words
‘public limited company’ or ‘pic’.
All other British companies are private
companies and are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Company Law
Laws relating to companies are designed to
meet the need for proper regulation of
business, to maintain open markets and to
create safeguards for those wishing to invest in
companies or do business with them. They
take account of EC directives on company law,
and on company and group accounts and their
auditing.
The London Stock Exchange has set up
committees to study corporate governance,
including the Cadbury and Greenbury
committees on best practices and directors’
pay respectively, whose recommendations are
being combined into a single set of principles
and code of practice. A third committee, the
Hampel committee, reviewed the progress
made by these studies and reported in January
1998. Under the new code, companies listed
on the Stock Exchange will be required to
state in their annual report and accounts
whether they are complying with the code’s
provisions, and give reasons for areas of non-
compliance. In addition, the Government
published a consultative document in March
1998 setting out proposals for a major review
of company law, with the objective of ensuring
that an up-to-date framework of self¬
regulation and company law work consistently
to promote competitiveness, growth,
accountability and transparency.
Legislation introduced in 1998 provides for
a new legal right to claim interest on late
payment of commercial debt, to be exercised
by small businesses initially against all large
firms, including public sector organisations,
and then, after two years, against all
enterprises and the public sector.
Insider dealing in shares is a criminal

INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
investigate possible occurrences. A licensing
procedure helps guarantee the professional
competence, integrity and independence of
people acting as trustees of bankrupt
individuals, or as liquidators, receivers or
administrators of insolvent companies.
Industrial Financing
Over half of companies’ funds for investment
and other purposes is generated internally.
Banks are the chief external source of finance,
but companies also turn to equity finance. The
main forms of short-term finance in the
private sector are bank overdrafts, trade credit
and factoring (making cash available to a
company in exchange for debts owing to it).
Types of medium- and long-term finance
include bank loans, mortgaging of property,
the leasing of equipment and the issue of
shares and other securities to the public
through the London Stock Exchange (see
chapter 30). Other sources of funding for
industry include government, the European
Union (EU) and specialist financial
institutions, such as financing and leasing,
factoring and venture capital companies.
Venture Capital
Venture capital provides long-term equity
capital for unquoted companies which are
starting up or expanding as well as those
undergoing management buy-outs and buy-
ins. It is available principally from venture
capital firms. The British Venture Capital
Association has 113 full members, which
represent virtually every major source of
venture capital in the UK. During 1997,
£4,200 million was invested by UK venture
capital companies in 1,272 businesses; of this,
over £3,000 million was invested in the UK.
‘Business angels’ (private investors) are an
increasingly important source of smaller
amounts of early-stage venture capital. An
updated Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS)
and Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) seek to
encourage individuals to invest in smaller
unlisted trading companies in return for
various tax reliefs and are designed to help
smaller British early-stage and expanding
firms. The EIS allows business angels to take a
position on the board of the investee company.
VCTs are similar to an investment trust and
are quoted on the Stock Exchange; they are
more suited to less active investors.
Taxation
The objectives of the Government’s
programme of taxation reform, which includes
reductions in the rate of corporation tax,
abolition of advance corporation tax and
changes in capital gains tax (see chapter 23),
are to promote enterprise, encourage
investment by small and medium-sized firms
and reduce the burden on business.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
is the largest employers’ organisation in the
UK, directly or indirectly representing more
than 250,000 companies and 200 employers’
organisations and trade associations. The CBI
aims to help create and sustain the conditions
in which business can compete. It campaigns
to lessen the administrative and regulatory
burdens on business, tackle handicaps on
competition and improve the performance of
companies. It offers members a range of
advisory services. It has 13 regional offices and
an office in Brussels. The CBI is the British
member of the Union of Industrial and
Employers’ Confederations of Europe
(UNICE).
Chambers of commerce represent business
views to the Government at national and local
levels. They promote local economic
development, for example, through
regeneration projects, tourism, inward
investment promotion and business services,
including overseas trade missions, exhibitions
and training conferences. The British
Chambers of Commerce, representing about
110,000 businesses, provides commercial and
export-related services and publishes business
surveys.
The Institute of Directors (IOD) has
around 42,500 members in the UK. It
provides business advisory services on matters
affecting company directors, such as corporate
433
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
management, insolvency and career
counselling, and represents the interests of
members to authorities in the UK and EU.
The Federation of Small Businesses is the
largest pressure group promoting the interests
of the self-employed and small firms. The
Federation has 100,000 members, and
provides them with expert information and
guidance on subjects such as taxation,
employment, health and safety, and insurance.
Trade associations represent companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members in dealings with
government departments.
Nationalised Industries
Some 100 public sector businesses, including
gas, electricity supply, coal and
telecommunications, have been privatised
since 1979. The remaining major nationalised
industries are the Post Office, London
Transport, BNFL and the Civil Aviation
Authority. Managing boards are appointed by
ministers, who have power to give general
directions but are not engaged in day-to-day
management. Managing boards and staffs of
nationalised industries are not civil servants.
The nationalised industries are required to act
as commercial enterprises and are expected to
conform to specific guidelines.
The Government announced in March
1998 that a new public-private partnership for
London Underground, a subsidiary of
London Transport, would be established, in
which the delivery of train services would stay
in the public sector while the private sector
would be responsible for investment and
maintenance (see p. 370). Public-private
partnerships are also planned in a number of
other areas (see p. 392). In addition, the
Government is reviewing options for granting
the Post Office greater commercial freedom
but remaining as a public sector business.
GOVERNMENT POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is mainly responsible for the
Government’s relations with industry and
commerce. Specific areas of responsibility
include company law, small firms,
competition policy and consumer affairs,
intellectual property and regional industrial
development and inward investment in
England. The Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR) oversees provision of regional
industrial aid through the Government
Offices for the Regions (GOs—see p. 7). The
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices
are responsible for industrial policies and
programmes in their areas. Export promotion
and technology and innovation, which are also
part of DTFs remit, are dealt with in chapters
24 and 25 respectively. The DTFs duties
regarding industrial relations are covered in
chapter 11.
DTI Aims
The purpose of the DTI is to increase UK
competitiveness and scientific excellence,
generating sustainable growth, employment
opportunities and enhanced quality of life for
all. The DTI works in partnership with
business and the scientific community to
achieve this objective by fostering:
• strong markets—helping business to
flourish by promoting open and
competitive markets and by giving
consumers a better deal;
• modern companies—working with
businesses to improve accountability and
to increase productivity and output on a
sustainable basis, in partnership with
their employees; and
• an enterprising nation—supporting
innovative and entrepreneurial
businesses, including a dynamic small
firms sector, and the achievement of
scientific and technological excellence
and its exploitation by UK business.
EU Single Market
The Government considers that the single
market (see p. 78) is beneficial to the
economies of all member states of the EU, and
that removal of trade barriers will lead to
reduced business costs and greater
434
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
competition and efficiency. It is committed to
making progress on issues that would lead to
the completion of the single market, including
removing remaining barriers to investment,
opening up government procurement, making
competition policy more streamlined and
reducing bureaucracy.
In the Government’s view, specific
advantages of the single market include:
• wider consumer choice;
• removal of barriers to trade through
mutual recognition of standards and
harmonisation;
• the right to trade financial services
throughout the EU on the basis of a single
authorisation ‘passport’ (see p. 512);
• mutual recognition of professional and
vocational qualifications; and
• a reduction in export business
bureaucracy.
Competitiveness
Maintaining and helping to improve the
competitiveness of business are at the heart of
the Government’s approach to economic and
industrial policy. It believes that an innovative
and competitive Britain, with an economy
based on high levels of skill, investment and
employment, is the only way to deliver
sustainable prosperity. The Government
works in close partnership with industry, and
a number of measures outlined in the 1997
Competitiveness UK: our partnership with
business initiative are already established,
including:
• a Competitiveness Advisory Group of
business people, which is developing
practical proposals to enhance
competitiveness for use in the
preparation of the Government’s
Competitiveness White Paper, which is
to be published in late 1998;
• the publication of ‘a benchmark for
business’, setting out how the UK
compares with overseas firms and
highlighting areas for improvement;
• the introduction of a Competition Bill to
reform and strengthen competition law
(see below);
• a programme to enhance the quality and
effectiveness of the Business Link
network (see p. 438);
• an Export Forum to review and improve
the quality of support for export
promotion (see p. 410); and
• the setting up of Regional Development
Agencies (see p. 441).
Other initiatives established or proposed are
the University for Industry to provide
opportunities for adults to improve their skills
(see p. 143) and the New Deal and other
programmes which offer vocational
preparation and training for young people,
including the unemployed, and unemployed
adults (see chapter 11).
Competition Policy
Effective and fair competition is essential to
ensure value and choice for customers while at
the same time encouraging business to
innovate and invest. The aim of competition
policy is to encourage and improve the
competitive process. Responsibility for
competition policy lies with the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry. Competition
law is administered by the Director General of
Fair Trading, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC) and the Restrictive
Practices Court.
Competition Bill
The Government’s Competition Bill is aimed
at strengthening competition law so that it is
more effective in dealing with anti¬
competitive practices. Expected to come fully
into effect in early 2000, the new legislation
will provide for prohibition of anti¬
competitive agreements and of abuse of
dominant positions. The main enforcement
authority will be the Director General of Fair
Trading. The Director General will have new,
stronger powers of investigation and will be
able to impose interim measures and financial
penalties of up to 10% of a firm’s UK
turnover. The various sectoral regulators will
have concurrent jurisdiction over cases
affecting the regulated utilities (in addition to
their licensing functions; see p. 438).
435
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The new law will be based on the EC
Treaty. The Director General must determine
cases in such a way as to ensure that there is
no inconsistency with Treaty principles and
European jurisprudence, and must have
regard to decisions or statements of the
European Commission. The aim is to secure
consistency of interpretation so far as is
possible, thereby reducing the compliance
costs for business of having to work under two
different regimes, one for the UK and one for
Europe. In line with European competition
law, the new legislation provides for individual
and block exemption from the prohibition of
anti-competitive agreements and exclusions
from both prohibitions. Only agreements and
conduct with a significant effect on
competition will be caught (thus freeing the
vast majority of firms from the burden of
notifying harmless, insignificant agreements,
as is required under the current rules).
A new body, the Competition Commission,
is to be set up. It will absorb the functions of
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and
will house an appeals tribunal with the status
of a high court. The tribunal will hear appeals
against decisions of the Director General and
the regulators on both the substance of a
decision and the amount of any penalty
imposed. Appeals against decisions of the
Competition Commission will be able to be
heard in the Court of Appeal on points of law
and on the financial penalty imposed.
The Bill, when enacted, will succeed the
current legislation—the Restrictive Trade
Practices Acts of 1976 and 1977 (which
regulate agreements between people or
companies that could limit their freedom to
operate independently), the Resale Prices Act
1976 (covering attempts to impose minimum
prices at which goods can be sold) and most of
the Competition Act 1980 (on anti¬
competitive practices)—which will be
repealed. However, the complex monopoly
provisions (covering parallel behaviour where
there is no overt collusion or agreement) of the
Fair Trading Act 1973 will remain, as will the
scale monopoly provisions.1 The scale
monopoly provisions enable the Secretary of
State to order structural remedies, such as
divestment, but only where avenues under the
new legislation (i.e., on abuse of dominance)
have been exhausted. The Director General’s
ability to make scale monopoly references to
the Competition Commission will be subject
to veto by the Secretary of State. This policy
will not apply in the regulated sectors, where
the full use of these powers is retained.
Mergers
The mergers regime is substantially
unchanged under the new Competition Bill.
Broadly, a merger qualifies for investigation if
it involves the acquisition of assets of more
than £70 million or the creation or
enhancement of a 25% share of the supply of
goods or services of any description in the UK
or a substantial part of it.
Qualifying mergers are considered by the
Director General of Fair Trading, who then
advises the Secretary of State. There is a
voluntary procedure for pre-notification of
proposed mergers which offers prompt
clearance of straightforward cases; most of
these are not prohibited. However, if there are
reasonable grounds for believing that a merger
could have a detrimental effect on
competition, the Director General can advise
the Secretary of State to refer it to the MMC.
Alternatively, the Director General may be
asked to obtain suitable undertakings from the
companies involved to remedy the adverse
effects identified. The Secretary of State may
accept undertakings by the parties concerned
to dispose of assets or to behave in a certain
way in order to eliminate the need for a full
investigation by the MMC.
If a merger or proposed merger is referred
and the MMC finds that it could be expected
to operate against the public interest, the
Secretary of State can prohibit it or allow it
subject to certain conditions being met. Where
the merger has already taken place, action can
be taken to reverse it. There are special
provisions for newspaper and water company
mergers.
' A complex monopoly is defined as a situation in which at
least two firms together supply 25% or more of a particular
good or service in the UK in a way that may distort
competition. A scale monopoly is defined as a situation in
which the action of a single firm supplying at least 25% of a
particular good or service may distort competition.
436
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
Certain mergers with an EC dimension,
assessed by reference to turnover, come under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the European
Commission. The Commission can ban
mergers if it concludes that they would create
or strengthen a dominant position which
would significantly impede effective
competition within the EU or a substantial
part of it; alternatively, it may negotiate
undertakings to correct the adverse effect.
Consumer Protection
The Government aims to maintain and
develop a clear and fair regulatory framework
which gives confidence to consumers and
contributes to the competitiveness of business.
It works closely with outside bodies which
have expert knowledge of consumer issues to
develop policies and legislation.
Consumer Legislation
Existing legislation covers the sale and supply
of goods and services. The Sale of Goods Act
1979 (as amended in 1994) ensures that
consumers are entitled to receive goods which
fit their description and are of satisfactory
quality. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968
prohibits misdescriptions of goods, services,
accommodation and facilities. This Act
enables regulations to be made requiring
information or instructions relating to goods
to be marked on or to accompany the goods or
to be included in advertisements.
False or misleading indications about prices
of goods are covered by the Consumer
Protection Act 1987. This Act also makes it a
criminal offence to supply unsafe products,
and provides product liability rights for
consumers. The regulatory framework to
control product safety is a mixture of
European and UK legislation, voluntary safety
standards and industry codes of practice. The
DTI runs a programme of safety awareness
initiatives, to allow consumers to help reduce
accidents themselves, both by learning new
information and by changing potentially
hazardous behaviour.2
The marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation.
Another law provides for the control of
medical products, and certain other substances
and articles, through a system of licences and
certificates. New regulations have also been
proposed to strengthen the protection of
consumers from unscrupulous doorstep
sellers.
The Director General of Fair Trading
promotes good trading practices and acts
against malpractice. Under the Fair Trading
Act, the Director General can recommend
legislative or other changes to stop practices
adversely affecting consumers’ economic
interests; encourage trade associations to
develop codes of practice promoting
consumers’ interests; and disseminate
consumer information and guidance. The
Director General can also demand assurances
as to future conduct from traders who
persistently breach the law to the detriment of
consumers.
The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is intended
to protect consumers in their dealings with
credit businesses. Most businesses connected
with the consumer credit or hire industry or
which supply ancillary credit services—for
example, credit brokers, debt collectors, debt
counsellors and credit reference agencies—
require a consumer credit licence. The
Director General is responsible for
administering the licensing system, including
refusing or revoking licences of those unfit to
hold them. The Director General also has
powers to prohibit unfit people from carrying
out estate agency work; to take court action to
prevent the publication of misleading
advertisements; and to stop traders using
unfair terms in standard contracts with
consumers.
The EU’s consumer programme covers
activities such as health and safety, protection
of the consumer’s economic interests,
promotion of consumer education and
strengthening the representation of
consumers. The views of British consumer
organisations on EU matters are represented
by the Consumers in Europe Group (UK).
2 Dll's Home Accident Surveillance System shows that,
every year, there are just under 4,000 deaths and nearly 3
million medically treated injuries as a result of home
accidents, which also cost the country about £30,000
million.
437
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
British consumer bodies also have a voice on
the European consumer ‘watchdog’ body,
the Bureau Europeen des Unions de
Consommateurs.
Regulation
An independent taskforce, set up in 1997
under a Work for Better Regulation
programme, advises the Government on
action to improve the effectiveness and quality
of existing regulations, while making sure
that they remain necessary, are fair—especially
to small businesses and the consumer
—affordable and simple to understand and
administer.
The privatised utilities—telecom¬
munications, electricity, gas, water, railways,
and so on—have independent regulators with
powers and duties to promote competition and
the interests of consumers. One of the
regulators’ duties is the setting of prices; the
annual increases are often set significantly
lower than the rate of inflation.
In July 1998, the Government announced
its decisions arising out of the review of the
regulation of gas, electricity,
telecommunications and water, following an
earlier consultation paper. Key decisions
include:
• consumer protection to be the regulators’
primary duty;
• the promotion of consumer interests by
independent consumer councils;
• the retention of RPIX3 as the
fundamental system of price regulation;
• a clearer link to be made between the
prices that utilities can charge and the
customer service standards which they
achieve;
• the availability of full information on
customer service standards and the link
between companies’ performance on
these standards and the remuneration of
directors; and
• the integration of the regulation of gas
and electricity, and the replacement of

payments.
the energy and telecommunication
regulators with executive boards.
Consumer Advice and Information
Advice and information on consumer matters
are given by 1,200 outlets of around 700
Citizens Advice Bureaux. Their work is co¬
ordinated by a national association linked to
the bureaux via local and regional committees.
Similar assistance is provided at trading
standards and consumer protection
departments of local authorities (in Northern
Ireland the Department of Economic
Development) and, in some areas, by specialist
consumer advice centres.
The National Consumer Council (and
associated councils for Scotland and Wales),
which receives government finance, presents
the consumer’s view to government, industry
and others. The General Consumer Council
for Northern Ireland has wide-ranging duties
in consumer affairs in general.
Consumer bodies for privatised utilities
investigate questions of concern to the
consumer. Some trade associations in industry
and commerce have established codes of
practice. In addition, several private
organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’
Association, funded by the subscriptions of
more than 1 million members to its various
Which? magazines.
Business Support Services
Government offers businesses a number of
support services, for example in promoting
best practice in management and in increasing
exports. Most support is centred on the
provision of advice and guidance to small and
medium-sized enterprises, usually delivered at
the local level, with the aim of improving their
underlying capabilities and competitiveness.
In many cases, the Government’s role is
simply to provide a framework within which
business people can share expertise.
The main mechanism for delivering
business information, advice and support in
England is ‘Business Link’. Business Links are
a network of local partnerships between
Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs—
438
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
see p. 153), chambers of commerce, enterprise
agencies, local authorities and other providers
of business support. There are 85 partnerships
with around 240 outlets. These provide a
single local point of access for integrated
information and advisory services tailored to
the needs of businesses, and deploy some 620
personal business advisers and 230 specialist
counsellors for export development, design,
and innovation and technology.
Under a simplified funding regime,
introduced in 1997, DTI support is directed
to one local competitiveness budget, giving
Business Links (and LECs in Scotland—see
p. 153) greater discretion in the design and
delivery of services to businesses.
Financial help is also available for innovation
activities under the new Smart scheme (see
p. 417). Other government assistance on offer
to smaller businesses includes:
• the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme,
which provides a guarantee enabling
authorised lenders to loan money to small
and medium-sized firms lacking the
security to receive conventional finance
(5,081 loans valued at £201 million were
guaranteed in 1997-98); and
• the EU small and medium-sized
enterprise initiative, providing firms with
grants and advice to encourage them to
adapt to the single market and to become
more internationally competitive.
In Scotland, the Business Shops Network
brings together business development
organisations, local authorities and chambers of
commerce to support new and growing
businesses; trained advisers supply information
and direct enquiries to the business support
services of local partners. Similar arrangements
have been set up in Wales through Business
Connect, which has a network of business
support and frontline advice centres. In
Northern Ireland small firms are helped by the
Local Enterprise Development Unit’s network
of regional offices, which provide co-ordinated
advice and support.
The Millennium Bug
The Government is working to ensure that
both the private and the public sector are fully
aware of the problem known as the
Millennium Bug (the century date change
problem). This problem is the result of
programming IT systems and electronic
equipment with the year represented by two
digits (e.g., ‘98’ for 1998), which might cause
them to malfunction or behave unpredictably
as the year changes to 2000 (which requires
four digits). There is no reliable estimate of
the cost of dealing with the problem, but it is a
significant sum for the UK as a whole.
Through its Action 2000 initiative, the
Government is helping companies to ensure
that their computer systems are fully
compliant with the date change-over. Two
ministerial committees are co-ordinating
action on the Government’s own systems and
on the national infrastructure of essential
services. The Government is also emphasising
the importance of co-operation with member
countries of the EU, the Group of Eight and
other international organisations to tackle the
cross-border implications of the problem.
Design, Quality and Standards
A wider and more effective use of design can
make a significant contribution to improving
competitiveness. The application of good
design is paramount in the creation of
innovative products, processes and services.
The DTI supports the benefits of good design
through the independent Design Council. As
advocate for design at the national level, the
Design Council undertakes research into
design issues, and develops design tools for
use by industry, business, education and
government, and publicises the results. The
Design Council liaises with Scottish Design,
the Welsh Design Advisory Service and the
Northern Ireland Design Directorate on
national initiatives. A separate design service
offers support for industry through Business
Links in England, with financial support from
the DTI.
Quality is important throughout the stages
of the business cycle—design, production,
marketing and delivery to customers.
Conformity assessment, such as certification
to the international standard for quality
management—BS EN ISO 9000 (which
includes ISO 9001, the standard embracing
439
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
design development)—is a key method of
improving quality and competitiveness. In
order to increase customer confidence, many
suppliers rely on independent conformity
assessment of their management systems or
products and services. The competence and
performance of organisations undertaking
such certification are officially accredited by
the DTI-sponsored United Kingdom
Accreditation Service (UKAS). Companies
certified by UKAS-accredited bodies are
permitted to use the national accreditation
marks, including the ‘tick and crown’ for BS
EN ISO 9000 certification.
The DTI is responsible for policy relating
to the National Measurement System. This
provides, through several DTI-funded
standards, laboratories and other contractors,
many of the physical measurement standards
and associated calibration facilities necessary
to ensure that measurements in the UK are
made on a common basis and to the required
accuracy (see p. 420).
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is the
national standards body and is the British
member of the European and international
standards organisations. It works with industry,
consumers and government to produce
standards relevant to the needs of the market and
suitable for public purchasing and regulatory
purposes. Government support for the BSI is
directed particularly towards European and
international standards, which account for over
90% of its work. Harmonised standards
contribute to removing technical barriers to
trade in the EU. The Kitemark is the BSPs
registered product certification trade mark.
Awards
The Queen’s Awards for Export,
Technological and Environmental
Achievement recognise outstanding
performance in their respective fields. Awarded
annually, they are valid for five years and are
granted by the Queen on the advice of the
Prime Minister, who is assisted by an advisory
committee consisting of senior representatives
from business, trade unions and government
departments. Any self-contained ‘industrial
unit’ in Britain with at least two full-time
employees is eligible to apply so long as it meets
the scheme’s criteria. Other awards include the
Export Award for Smaller Businesses (for firms
employing fewer than 200 people) and the
MacRobert Award for engineering made by the
Fellowship of Engineering for successful
technological innovation.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation by
providing systems which enable the
originators of inventions and industrial
designs and the proprietors of trade marks to
protect their rights. These matters, along with
copyright in literary, artistic and musical
works, are the responsibility of the DTPs
Patent Office, which includes the Designs
Registry and the Trade Marks Registry. The
Patent Office is also involved with the
international harmonisation of rules and
procedures and with modernising and
simplifying intellectual property law. Patent
protection is available under the European
Patent Convention and the Patent Co¬
operation Treaty; trade mark registration is
available through a Community Trade Mark.
Rights may be established in other countries
by virtue of separate conventions on industrial
property, literary and artistic work, and music
and broadcasting.
Education and Training
Education and training are central to ensuring
that the UK is able to compete in the ever-
changing global economy by having a flexible,
highly skilled and highly qualified workforce.
The Government has established a number of
measures to increase opportunities in
education and training (see chapters 10 and
11), including the setting up of a University
for Industry through a public/private
partnership.
Training Schemes
Training schemes are available through a
network of 78 business-led Training and
440
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and
Wales and 22 Local Enterprise Companies
(LECs) in Scotland, run by Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise (see p. 442). In Northern Ireland,
training schemes are run by the Training and
Employment Agency (see p. 154).
TECs and LECs are independent
companies managed by boards of directors,
the majority of whom are drawn from private
business. They provide training, vocational
education and enterprise programmes on
behalf of the Government and encourage
employers to develop the potential of all their
employees through, for instance, attainment of
the Investors in People standard (see p. 154).
In addition, they offer advisory and training
services to businesses, including schemes to
enhance the expertise of managers. In
Scotland, LECs supply the full range of
services offered by the enterprise bodies—
support and advice to businesses,
environmental renewal, training programmes
for unemployed people and encouragement to
businesses to invest in management and skills.
TECs and LECs also have a key role in
regeneration and economic development
activities locally (see chapter 21).
A review of the ways of improving the
contribution of the TECs in England to the
Government’s education, training and
enterprise objectives was announced in
May 1998.
Management Education and Development
Management education is available at most
universities and colleges of higher and further
education. Regional management centres have
been established in England and Wales by
associations of these colleges, and there are
several similar organisations in Scotland.
Universities run full-time postgraduate
programmes at business schools, such as those
of London, Manchester, Durham, Warwick
and Strathclyde universities.
The British Institute of Management
encourages excellence in management. Other
bodies are concerned with standards and
training in specialised branches of
management. The employer-led Management
Charter Initiative (MCI) is the operating arm
of the National Forum for Management
Education and Development and the leading
industrial body for management standards.
Regional Industrial Development
Regional policy is designed to promote
economic growth and competitiveness in all
areas of the UK, working in partnership with
businesses, local authorities, voluntary groups
and others. Where additional help is needed,
it is focused on the Assisted Areas
(Development Areas and Intermediate Areas),
which cover around 35% of the UK’s working
population. The promotion of inward
investment (see p. 443) is a key element in the
Government’s regional policy.
The main instrument of government
support to industry in the Assisted Areas in
Great Britain is Regional Selective Assistance
(RSA), which is designed to:
• help create and safeguard jobs;
• help attract international investment; and
• improve the competitiveness of
disadvantaged areas.
In 1997-98, each £1 million RSA grant in
England attracted £10 million of capital
investment and directly created or safeguarded
around 240 jobs.
England
English Partnerships promotes job creation,
inward investment and environmental
improvement through reclamation and
development of vacant, derelict, under-used
or contaminated land and buildings (see p.
355). The Rural Development Commission
(RDC) advises the Government on economic
and social development in the countryside,
promotes jobs and supports essential services.
The Commission’s resources are concentrated
in areas of greatest need, known as Rural
Development Areas, covering about 35% of
the area of England (see p. 356).
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)
and a strategic authority for London are to be
established by April 1999 (April 2000 for
London), aimed at promoting economic
development and regeneration, and
441
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
co-ordinating the work of regional and local
partners in the fields of business support,
competitiveness, inward investment,
employment and training (see p. 9). The RDAs
will work with the Government Offices for the
Regions, chambers of commerce, TECs,
Business Links and other economic
development bodies. They will also take over
most of the activities of English Partnerships
and the rural regeneration programmes of the
RDC as part of the Government’s commitment
to put decision-making on regeneration and
economic development at the regional level.
The RDC’s advisory functions and countryside
support for rural communities and services will
be transferred to a new agency formed by the
merger of the RDC with the Countryside
Commission (see p. 319).
Scotland
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise manage government and EU
support to industry and commerce, in lowland
and highland Scotland respectively, operating
mainly through the network of LECs (see
p. 153). The duties of the two bodies include:
• promoting industrial efficiency and
competitiveness;
• attracting inward investment and
encouraging exports;
• giving financial and management support
to new businesses and helping existing
ones to expand;
• improving the environment by
reclaiming derelict and contaminated
land; and
• increasing job opportunities and skills.
A Scottish Equity Partnership fund helps
smaller firms with access to finance. Involving
both Scottish Enterprise and private investors,
the fund provides venture and development
capital for start-ups, early-stage investments,
management buy-outs/buy-ins and mature
businesses seeking to expand.
Wales
The purposes of the Welsh Development
Agency (WDA—see p. 357) are to further
economic and social development, promote
efficiency in business and international
competitiveness, and improve the environment
of Wales. In conjunction with the private
sector, it provides affordable, high-quality sites
and premises for existing businesses and
inward investors. The WDA’s land reclamation
programme is the largest and most sustained
landscape improvement project in Europe. Its
Business Development division focuses on
developing stronger regional clusters (such as
supply and services chains), increasing
standards and efficiency and helping Welsh
companies to exploit new technology.
The Land Authority for Wales, which was
involved in economic regeneration, and the
Development Board for Rural Wales, which
promoted the economic and social well-being
of rural mid-Wales, were amalgamated with
the WDA in October 1998.
Northern Ireland
Industrial development policy in Northern
Ireland is the responsibility of the Department
of Economic Development (see p. 538) and is
implemented through:
• the Industrial Development Board,
which deals with overseas companies
considering Northern Ireland as an
investment location, as well as the
development of local companies with
more than 50 employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which promotes enterprise and the
development of small businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, which provides advice and
assistance on research and development,
innovation and technology transfer; and
• the Training and Employment Agency,
which helps with in-company training
and management development.
A variety of schemes and assistance
(including grants, loans and share capital
investment) are on offer to help companies
with marketing, exporting, product
development and design, improving
productivity and quality, training, and
research and development.
442
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
Inward Investment
Inward investment is increasingly important
to the economy, with over £170,000 million
currently invested from overseas; in 1997
alone, the inward direct investment flow into
the UK was £22,600 million. Indeed, the UK
is second only to the United States as the
leading destination for international direct
investment, which helps to develop and
modernise the industrial base by introducing
new products and processes, as well as
bringing in management expertise. It also
provides new jobs and boosts output, exports
and tax revenues.
Recent examples of inward investment
projects include:
• a £450 million expansion plan by
Honda in its Swindon factory,
expanding the plant’s annual capacity
from 150,000 to 250,000 vehicles;
• investment of £109 million by the US
pharmaceuticals company Pfizer in
expanding its medicines research
centre at Sandwich (Kent); and
• a new vehicle engine production
facility planned by Toyota at its site
in Deeside (north Wales), doubling
the firm’s workforce in the area.
The UK receives about 30% of total EU
direct investment, including 38% of
investment from North America, 40% from
Japan and 20% from Germany. Advantages to
overseas investors of preferring Britain include
its membership of the single European market,
a flexible and adaptable workforce, good labour
relations, low taxation, a respected legal system
and the English language.
The Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB) co¬
ordinates the promotion of inward investment,
operating overseas through diplomatic posts
and in the UK through its partners in
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the
English regions.
Support provided in England by Regional
Development Organisations (to be replaced by
the Regional Development Agencies from
1 April 1999) is available elsewhere in the UK
through:
• Locate in Scotland, operated jointly by
The Scottish Office and Scottish
Enterprise;
• the Welsh Office Industry and Training
Department and the Welsh Development
Agency’s International Division; and
• the Industrial Development Board for
Northern Ireland.
European Union Regional Policy and Aid
The EU seeks to reduce disparities between
the regions of the Union. The principal
responsibility for helping poorer areas remains
with national authorities, but the EU
complements schemes by awarding grants and
loans from various sources, including the
European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF).
EU Structural Funds, especially the
ERDF, play an important role in regional
development. Three areas—Northern Ireland,
the Highlands and Islands, and Merseyside—
are eligible for assistance under ‘Objective 1’,
which aims to promote the development of
regions lagging behind the rest of the EU;
they are receiving around £1,900 million of
EU funding over the period 1997-99. The
ERDF also provides finance for areas of
industrial decline and for rural development.
Structural Funds are also available to help

typically include improvements to, and
building of, infrastructure projects;
construction of trans-European transport
links; support for business and tourism
development; and capital investment in
industry.

In 1997 there was a marked down-turn in the agricultural economy. The value
of the UK’s gross output of all agricultural commodities fell by £1,900 million
(11%), mainly because of the lower prices received by farmers for all their main
produce, a situation aggravated by the strength of sterling, and the fall-out
from the BSE crisis. The UK has made substantial progress in eradicating BSE,
and has introduced the most comprehensive cattle-tracing system in Europe.
The European Union (EU) ban on the export of British beef and beef products
has now been partially lifted.
Agriculture
Agriculture continues to be a principal focus
of EU policy. In 1998, EU expenditure on
agriculture is forecast to be about 44,000
million European Currency Units (ECUs;
£30,000 million). This represents just over
half of all expenditure forecast under the EU
budget. Agriculture now contributes less than
2% of EU GDP and the proportion of the
labour force working in it has declined from
almost 20% (over 14 million farmers and farm
workers in 1960) to about 5% today.
Expenditure on food in the EU accounts for
about 15% of average consumer expenditure.
The share of agricultural imports and exports
combined as a proportion of total EU trade is
about 12% (in volume terms). EU experts
urge that society can afford to become more
concerned about how its food is produced, the
environmental effects of food production
systems and the balanced development of
rural areas. Agricultural policy will need to
adjust to these new social priorities and attend
more closely to the twin challenge of
international competitiveness and
environmental awareness.
While the UK remains among the most
competitive agricultural economies, with some
of the lowest labour costs in Europe, its
position in relation to its EU partners is
weakening. The net value added (which
measures how efficiently an industry converts
inputs to outputs) of British agriculture was
90% above the EU average in 1980. By 1997,
this had fallen to only 13% above the EU
average.
In 1997 British agriculture employed 2%
(531,000 people) of the total workforce. The
agricultural contribution to GDP fell from
£9,148 in 1996 to £7,563 million in 1997,
1.1% of the total. Food, feed and beverages
accounted for 9.2% of Britain’s imports by
value and for 5.8% of exports. Self-sufficiency

in food and feed fell in 1997: from 54.3% to
52.9% of all food and feed, and from 70.2%
to 68.8% of indigenous-type food and feed.
(The figures for 1988 were 57% and 74%
respectively.) This was partly because of the
EU worldwide ban on the export of British
beef, which came into force during 1996, and
the fall in the value of home-produced food.
Land Use
In 1997, 11.65 million hectares (28.8 million
acres) were under crops and grass. A further
5.6 million hectares (13.8 million acres) were
used for rough grazing, most of it in hilly
areas. Soils vary from the thin poor ones of
highland Britain to the rich fertile soils of low-
lying areas, such as the fenlands of eastern
England. The climate is generally temperate,
though rainfall distribution over Britain is
uneven (see p. 506).
Farming
In 1997 there were some 237,700 farm holdings
in Britain (excluding minor holdings too small
to be surveyed on a regular basis). These main
holdings have an average area of 70.6 hectares
(174.4 acres), again excluding minor holdings.
About 45% of them are smaller than eight
European size units (ESU).1 About two-thirds
of all agricultural land is owner-occupied.
1 ESUs measure the financial potential of the holding in
terms of the margins which might be expected from stock
and crops: eight ESU is judged the minimum for full-time
holdings.

Labour productivity (in terms of whole¬
time person equivalents) increased by 28.5%
during 1987-97. Total income from farming
(that of farmers, partners, directors and their
spouses, and family workers, see Table 27.2)
was estimated at £3,363 million in 1997, 35%
less (at current prices) than in 1996, or 37%
less in real terms. This fall, compared with an
average EU decline of 3.1% in real terms, owes
much to the effect of the rise of sterling and the
green pound rate, resulting in lower prices for
farmers for all major commodities. For
example, beef prices in Wales dropped by
26.9% during 1995-97. Livestock markets have
closed at Banbury, Kidderminster, Canterbury
and in Carmarthenshire and Anglesey.
PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 27.3 as a percentage by weight
of total supplies. Total new supply is home
production plus imports less exports.
Livestock
Over half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairy farming or to beef cattle and
sheep. Most of the animals are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland and northern and south¬
western England. Among world-famous
British livestock are the Hereford and

Cattle and Sheep
Cattle and sheep constitute about 39% of the
value of Britain’s gross agricultural output.
Dairy production is the largest part of the
sector, followed by cattle and calves, and then
sheep and lambs. Most dairy cattle in the UK
are bred by artificial insemination. In 1997 the
average size of dairy herds was 66 (excluding
minor holdings), while the average yield of
milk for each dairy cow was 5,810 litres
(1,278 gallons).
More than half of home-fed beef
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Holstein Friesian breed
448
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
predominates. The remainder derives from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves, mostly in the hills and uplands. The
traditional British beef breeds (see p. 447) and,
increasingly, imported breeds such as
Charolais, Limousin, Simmental and Belgian
Blue, are used for beef production. The size of
the beef-breeding herd expanded by 36%
during 1987-97, while the dairy herd
decreased by 18%.
Consumer confidence in British beef,
affected by the BSE crisis (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy; see p. 453), picked up during
1997 when household consumption increased
by 8% on 1996. The number of homes buying
beef recovered to over half by the end of 1997,
but was still well below 1994 levels when the
figure was over 60%. The long-term national
trend, however, has been a reduction in red
meat consumption, unrelated to concern over
BSE.
The UK has more than 60 native sheep
breeds and many cross-bred varieties. The size
of the British breeding flock rose slightly in
1997, though production of sheepmeat was
nearly 8% lower. A large number of lambs had
remained on farm and were yet to be sold. The
average realised return for sheepmeat in the
UK was 7% lower than in 1996, when early
summer prices were high after the beef crisis.
Pigs
Pig production is particularly important in
East Anglia and Yorkshire. Pigmeat prices
were low for most of 1998, with few producers
making a profit, because of the continuing
expansion in the breeding herd. This resulted
in increased supplies in an already
oversupplied market. Demand for exports (for
breeding stock) to other EU countries—for
example, Germany, Italy and France—
remained good and imports stayed at similar
levels to 1997. About 21% of holdings with
breeding sows account for 83% of the national
breeding herd, which comprises some 791,000
sows.
Poultry
The total bird population in 1998 was about 160
million: 97 million chickens and other table
fowls; 32 million birds in the laying flock; 9.7
million growing pullets; 10.3 million fowls for
breeding; and 11.7 million other types of bird.
Poultry production in 1997 was 1.5 million
tonnes, a 3% increase on 1996, as producers
anticipated rising demand because of the BSE
crisis. Because of the strength of sterling,
however, imports grew by 2%, depressing
wholesale broiler prices. Exports grew by 15%
and there was only a 1% increase in domestic
usage. Hen egg production, for all uses, went up
from 873 million dozen in 1996 to 896 million
dozen in 1997, but, with cheaper imports, the
overall value of output fell by 8% on 1996.
Animal Welfare
Britain has a highly developed framework of
rules on animal welfare. Where appropriate,
these implement EU requirements which
apply during transit, at slaughter and to
certain species on farm. A UK initiative has
resulted in a new European Commission
(EC) Directive, to take effect at the end of
1999, setting common standards for animal
welfare on farms across the EU. The
Government continues to press for further
improvements in EU standards, and revised
rules for the welfare of laying hens are under
discussion.
The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order
1997 is being reviewed to see whether it can be
refined or improved after a year of operational
experience. UK legislation governing the
welfare of animals in livestock markets has also
been reviewed and a Markets Strategy, aimed
at improving standards and communication,
has been launched. EU criteria have been
agreed for the construction and operation of
staging points for animals during transport.
The UK has been unable to support a
compromise solution agreed on additional
standards for road vehicles used to transport
animals on longer journeys and will continue
to seek improvements, particularly for
ventilation of livestock vehicles. Detailed
preparations for the overhaul of UK
procedures for checking the welfare of live
animals exported to Europe were well
advanced early in 1998.
During 1997 the State Veterinary Service
carried out 4,344 inspections on farms to

were found in 112 cases.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and central-
southern England and eastern Scotland. The
main crops are shown in Table 27.5. In the
UK in 1997, the area planted to cereals
totalled 3.5 million hectares (8.7 million
acres), an increase of just under 5% on 1996,
following further reductions in the set-aside
rate from 10% to 5% (see p. 451). There was
nevertheless a production decrease of about 1
million tonnes because of lower average yields.
Overall the price of cereals fell by 20%, partly
owing to the strength of sterling, but also
because of surpluses available from previous
harvests and poorer quality. Their output
value fell by ^476 million (15%).
Large-scale potato and vegetable
cultivation takes place on the fertile soils
throughout the UK, often with irrigation.
Principal areas are the peat and silt fens of
Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk;
the sandy loams of Norfolk, Suffolk, West
450
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
Midlands, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire; the peat soils of South
Lancashire; and the alluvial silts by the river
Humber. Early potatoes are produced in
Shropshire, Pembrokeshire, Cornwall, Devon,
Essex, Suffolk, Kent, Cheshire and south-west
Scotland. Production of high-grade seed
potatoes is confined mainly to Scotland,
Northern Ireland, the northern uplands and
the Welsh borders. The output value of
potatoes fell by £197 million (36%) in 1997.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet
provides just over half of home needs, most of
the remainder being refined from raw cane
sugar imported under the sugar protocol to
the Lome Convention (see p. 408).
Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS)
The AAPS, of which set-aside is a part and
which originally aimed to cut cereals support
prices by 35% between 1993 and 1996, helps
compensate farmers for these cuts. They are
paid for the land under arable production, not
the quantity of crop. To qualify for subsidy,
all but the smallest farmers must set aside a
proportion of their land (in 1999 this will go
up to 10%) to reduce cereals production.
Where land is eligible, the subsidy is paid on
cereals, oilseeds, proteins (including peas for
harvesting dry) and linseed.
Set-aside payments compensate farmers for
leaving part of their land fallow, while keeping
it in good agricultural condition. They are
encouraged to maximise the environmental
benefit of the scheme and are allowed to count
land entered into various environmental
schemes (see p. 457) against their set-aside
obligation. They also have the choice of
growing crops for non-food purposes on set-
aside land, such as short-rotation coppice as a
renewable fuel and oilseed rape for biodiesel.
Horticulture
In 1997 the land used for horticulture
(excluding hops, potatoes and peas for
harvesting dry) was about 184,000 hectares
(454,680 acres), compared with 189,000
hectares in 1996. Vegetables grown in the
open accounted for 68% of this, orchards for
16%, soft fruit for 6% and ornamentals
(including hardy nursery stock, bulbs and
flowers grown in the open) for 8%. More than
one vegetable crop may be taken from the
same area of land in a year, so that the
estimated area actually cropped for
horticulture in 1997 was 229,100 hectares
(566,129 acres).
The output value of horticultural products
(including peas harvested dry), at £1,752
million, was £96 million (5%) lower than in
1996, owing to lower vegetable prices and a
poor fruit harvest. Mushrooms are the single
most valuable horticultural crop, with a farm
gate value of £174 million in 1997. Some
£2,741 million of horticultural produce was
imported.
Under the reformed EU fruit and
vegetables regime, EU grants (up to 50% of
eligible expenditure) are payable to producer
organisations which aim to improve
cultivation techniques, with emphasis on
environmentally sound practice, quality
improvements and marketing. In 1997, 65
programmes were approved in Britain, with a
potential grant of £10.3 million in 1998.
Alternative Crops
The Alternative Crops Unit of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)
seeks to encourage the marketing of renewable
energy raw materials from crops. It funded
just over £1 million of R&D in 1997-98. It
participated in the Government’s review of
energy generation from renewable sources,
with special emphasis on short-rotation
coppice, the most promising energy crop for
British conditions. Producers’ desire to
diversify in the UK has encouraged the
growth of other crops, such as flax (for linen),
hemp (for paper, canvas and rope) and woad
(for blue dye).
Genetically Modified Crops
Genetic modification (GM) procedures can be
used to transfer useful genes between species.
Experimental releases of GM crops have been
taking place in the EU for some years, and in
France in 1998, 2,000 hectares (4,940 acres) of
a GM maize were grown commercially for the
first time in the EU. An EU-wide regulatory
451
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
framework, designed to protect human health
and the environment, covers all stages of work
with GM organisms (GMOs). All GMOs
(which include GM crops) are subject to
safety evaluation before a consent for release
into the environment is agreed. In the UK, the
Advisory Committee on Releases into the
Environment (ACRE) considers applications
to release and market GMOs. The UK
regulations implement the EC Directive
which covers the deliberate release of GMOs
into the environment for research and
marketing purposes. Consent applications for
the sale of GMOs throughout Europe are
considered by all EU member states before a
consent is issued.
Whether GM crops are safe to human
health and the environment is an overriding
issue. As pests and pathogens can acquire
resistance to most chemical and biological
control measures if they are exposed
frequently enough, resistance management is
considered essential. ACRE has published
details of breaches of consents, most of which
concern failures by companies to stick to
procedures designed to prevent GM crops
straying outside their plots or hybridising with
neighbouring plants. Some companies have
been forced to end trials.
Before GM foods are approved for sale in
the EU they must be assessed for safety in
accordance with the EC Novel Foods
Regulation (258/97), which established an
EU-wide pre-market approval system for all
novel foods—those which have not been used
for human consumption in the EU before,
including those containing or produced from
GMOs. The regulation prescribes specific
labelling when an item is judged not to be
equivalent to an existing food. Food will also
need labelling if there are any health or ethical
concerns or if it contains a GMO. In the UK,
assessment of novel foods is carried out by the
independent Advisory Committee on Novel
Foods and Processes. In May 1998 the EU
agreed on rules for labelling Monsanto’s GM
soya and Ciba Geigy’s GM maize, approved
before the Novel Foods Regulation came into
force. An EC regulation of September 1998
requires all foods containing GM soya or
maize to be labelled except when neither
protein nor DNA resulting from the
modification is present. It also provides for the
formulation of a list of ingredients which
member states agree do not contain novel
protein or DNA.
An EC Directive on the legal protection of
biotechnological inventions was adopted in
June 1998—to clarify and harmonise those
aspects of national EU patent laws which
concern genetic materials, plants and animals.
It seeks to balance the needs of the food
industry to access patents to foster research
and the ethical concerns which surround
biotechnology. It affirms the possibility of
patenting GM plants and animals; but if
modification is likely to cause suffering to the
animal, no patent should be granted, unless it
can be shown that there is substantial medical
benefit to man or animal.
FOOD SAFETY
In 1997, around 100,000 people were recorded
as having contracted food poisoning in the
UK, although because of under-reporting, this
is likely to be lower than the true figure. The
White Paper The Food Standards Agency: A
Force for Change, published in January 1998,
sets out plans for a powerful new government
body which will take over responsibility from
the health and agriculture departments for
protecting public health in food matters. The
new Agency will:
• advise health ministers on food safety
policy, as well as on food authenticity,
composition and labelling;
• ensure that the public have access to
clear, unbiased information on food,
including nutrition and diet;
• have powers to take action at any point in
the food chain (including on farms) to
ensure that public health is adequately
protected;
• have a high-profile role in co-ordinating
food law enforcement by local
authorities; and
• serve all the UK, with separate
executives in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
The Government intends to publish
legislation to establish the Agency for public

CUSTOMS
Cheese-rolling, Cooper’s Hill,
Gloucestershire: this ancient
Whit Monday custom, originally
a necessary ritual for the
maintenance of grazing rights
on the common, now takes place
every Spring Bank Holiday.
The course is down a part of the
very steep hill which is free from
trees. The Master of Ceremonies,
wearing a white coat and top hat
decked with coloured ribbons,
gives a cheese to the Starter
and slowly counts to ‘four’.
On ’three’ the Starter sends the
cheese rolling down the slope
and at ‘four’ the competitors
run after it. The winner keeps
the cheese, which is protected by
a strong wooden casing.
Burning the Clavie, performed at Burghead,
Morayshire, on January 11, is an old
fire-ritual connected with the New Year.
A tar-barrel is sawn in two and the bottom,
smaller, half is fixed to a salmon-fisher’s stake,
known as the Spoke. A herring-cask is then
broken up and its staves fastened round the
bottom of the half-barrel, and to the Spoke.
The completed Clavie is filled with dry,
tar-soaked wood, set alight and more tar
added. It is then raised aloft by the first of a
series of bearers and a procession takes place,
following the boundaries of the old town.
When it reaches a headland known as
Doorie Hill, the Clavie comes to rest,
and more wood and tar are added to
produce a blaze that can be seen for miles.
Firing the Fenny Poppers: oddly shaped and of considerable
age, the Fenny Poppers are six miniature cannons kept in
St Martin’s Church, Fenny Stratford, Buckinghamshire.
Every year on November 11, St Martin’s Day, they are brought
into the churchyard and fired, at eight in the morning, noon,
two o’clock and six o’clock in the evening. It is customary
for the Vicar to fire the first popper. The tradition forms part
of the celebrations of the Patronal Festival of the parish and is
also a tribute to Dr Browne Willis, the man responsible for the
building of the church, which was completed in 1730.
Running Auction: the will of
William Clay, in 1742, provided that
the cost of an annual gift to the poor
of white bread was to be met by the
rent from two pieces of land in Bourne,
Lincolnshire, later known as White-bread
Meadow. This land has since been let
every Easter at an auction (above) in which
bidding is only valid while two boys
are running up and down a 60-yard course.
The auction ends when no bid is received
during a complete run of the course.
In recent years the Bourne Borderers
Morris Dance Group have joined in
the event, and money raised is now used
to support local charities.

BSE in the UK: a Chronology
November 1986 First confirmation of BSE
in the UK.
June 1988 BSE made notifiable disease.
July 1988 Ban on potentially infectious
ruminant-derived protein in ruminant feed,
then identified as probable cause of BSE.
August 1988 Animals suspected of having
BSE subject to compulsory notification and
slaughter.
November 1989 Ban on specified bovine
offal for human consumption.
January 1993 Scrapie in sheep, thought to
have been transferred to cattle as BSE, made
notifiable disease; 328 positive cases
diagnosed.
Early 1993 BSE epidemic peaks at about
3,500 cases a month.
1995-97 BSE cases decline at rate of over
40% a year.
March 1996 Government announcement of
possible link between BSE and new variant
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) in
humans. Immediate EU worldwide ban on
exports from the UK of all live bovine
animals, beef and beef products, bovine
semen and embryos, and all mammalian
meat and bonemeal (MBM). Ban on feeding
MBM to all farmed livestock.
April 1996 Calf Processing Aid Scheme
(CPAS) introduced for slaughter and
disposal of male calves of any breed under
20 days of age. Up to mid-August 1998,
CPAS had processed 1.2 million calves.
May 1996 Over Thirty Months Scheme
excludes all cattle over 30 months old from
human and animal food chains and provides
for their purchase and slaughter, and for
carcases to be incinerated or sent to
rendering plants for processing and
destruction, August 1998 over 2.4 million
animals disposed of.
June 1996 Florence Agreement provides
mechanism for eventual lifting of ban and
resumption of exports, subject to specified
conditions. All MBM from farms, feedmills
and feed merchants recalled and disposed
of.
July 1996 Cattle passports introduced.
Cattle born or imported after 1 July cannot
be accepted for slaughter for human
consumption without valid passport. By end
August 1998, nearly 6 million passports
issued.
December 1996 Government announcement
of selective slaughter programme—cull of
animals considered to be most at risk of
infection—targeting cattle born between 1
July 1989 and 30 June 1993, believed to have
shared same contaminated feed as
confirmed BSE cases in first 6 months of
life, ^y August 1998, 72,300 animals
slaughtered in Great Britain.
March 1997 Specified Bovine Material
(SBM) Order consolidates previous
legislation on removal of SBM, notably head

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
March 1998 EU Standing Veterinary
Committee and Agriculture Council votes to
adopt Export Certified Herd Scheme
(ECHS) and lift beef export ban for beef
produced under ECHS in Northern Ireland,
where a computerised database traces
registration and movements of all cattle.
Public inquiry into BSE starts to take
evidence on 9 March. To deliver its report
by 30 June 1999.
In 12 months after March 1996 about
£ 1,500 million of public money spent on
BSE-related measures. Cost expected to rise
to total £3,500 million of public money by
end 1999-2000. According to independent
study commissioned by the Government,
BSE crisis cost economy £740-^980 million
in first year—just over 0.1% of GDP.
Potential impact of BSE on output reduced
by substitution of other meat products for
beef-estimated to have reduced cost of
BSE by between 50% and 66%. Over 12
months following BSE crisis UK beef
market contracted by 36%, reflecting a 24%
fall in consumer demand and loss of £700
million beef export market.
June 1998 Beef export ban lifted for ECHS
beef from Northern Ireland. European
Commission proposes Date-based Export
Scheme (DBES), which limits exports of
fresh beef from cattle born after 1 August
1996.
July 1998 MAFF progress report shows
that BSE has predominantly affected dairy
rather than beef herds: almost two-thirds of
British herds with breeding cattle have
never had a case of BSE and 84% of beef
suckler herds have never had a case.
Reported incidence also shows that herds
with more than four cases of BSE account
for nearly three-quarters of all cases,
but represent only just over 10% of
all herds.
Given declining long-term trend in
consumption of red meat, aggravated by
BSE epidemic, the Government has pointed
out that the beef industry will have to
restructure to recover full economic
viability, in parallel with restructuring in
other EU member states.
August 1998 27 cases of nvCJD in UK to
date. Slaughter scheme for offspring of BSE
cases introduced on voluntary basis. The
Scheme supports DBES proposal and will
be made compulsory when DBES is
adopted.
consultation and will introduce a Bill in
Parliament as soon as time is available.
EU food law harmonisation covers food
safety, fair trading and informative labelling.
For example, the Beef Labelling Scheme
provides information on fresh and frozen beef
(including mince) which may be confirmed
through improved traceability systems. The
Government is working with the food
industry and with organisations representing
those suffering from severe food allergies to
increase awareness of the potential dangers of
allergic reaction to foods such as peanuts.
Expert advice on food safety is provided by
independent advisory committees (see also
p. 461), such as the Food Advisory
Committee and the Advisory Committee on
Novel Foods and Processes.
The results of annual surveys of up to 50
different foods (including milk, bread,
cereals, fruit and vegetables, and meats)
tested for pesticide residues are to be made
public in 1999, along with the brand names of
the products tested. From July 1998 brand
names of products testing positive for
veterinary drug residues will also be
published.
The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) has
about 1,400 inspectors, who are responsible
for enforcing legislation on meat hygiene,
inspection, animal welfare at slaughter and
BSE in all licensed fresh meat premises in
Great Britain. MHS staff carry out hygiene
assessments of premises. The resulting
Hygiene Assessment System score is a general
guide to the hygiene performance of plants
measured over a period. The Government
publishes these scores as part of its policy to
raise standards in the industry. Irrespective of
a plant’s score, however, before any meat

enters the food chain, it must be inspected
and health-marked as fit for human
consumption. To safeguard the ultimate
consumer, businesses manufacturing, selling
or using animal feed additives will now have
to apply for official approval or registration.
EXPORTS
Provisional data for 1997 suggest that the
value of exports related to agriculture (food,
feed and drink), at £9,933 million, was similar
to that for 1996 (compared with a figure of
£17,086 for imports). The main EU markets
in 1997 were France (£1,278 million, down
15%), the Irish Republic (£1,121 million, up
1%), Germany (£730 million, down 7%), and
Spain (£703 million, up 1%). Other key
markets were the United States (£731 million,
up 16%) and Japan (£288 million, up 5%).
Cereals (unmilled and processed) and cereal
dried products were the largest category of
British food exports, worth £1,400 million in
1997. There were increases, compared with
1996, in exports of pork (£270 million, up
10%), poultrymeat (£200 million, up 12%)
and sugar (£170 million, up 33%). Other
exports which increased include dairy
products, potato products, sugar
confectionery, spices, seasonings, tea
and cocoa.
Export promotion for food and drink is
headed by Food from Britain, an organisation
funded by MAFF (£4.9 million in 1997-98)
and industry (£6.5 million), which provides a
range of business development services for
food and drink companies seeking to expand
in international markets and within the UK
speciality food and drink sector. It co¬
ordinates the British presence at ten or more
international food and drink exhibitions each
year and organises the annual Food from
Britain Export Awards. For all other
agricultural products and services MAFF
oversees export promotion. Its presence at
overseas trade fairs during 1998 attracted over
1,200 serious enquiries for British agricultural
products. Exports of agricultural machinery
and equipment in 1997 were worth £1,413
million.
The annual Royal Agricultural Show, held
at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire in early July,
Marlow Foods won Food from Britain’s
£10,000 Export Innovation Award in 1997
for its range of healthy low-fat meat
alternatives made from Quorn, a myco-
protein food related to mushrooms. Marlow
has doubled Quorn’s overseas sales in the
past three years, exporting to the
Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and the
Irish Republic. Other awards went to

and the Royal Ulster Agricultural Show in

ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
Four government departments have joint
responsibility for agriculture and fisheries
matters: MAFF; The Scottish Office
Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries
Department (SOAEFD); the Welsh Office;
and the Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland. MAFF’s regional
administrative structure in England consists of
nine Regional Service Centres. Their work
relates to payments under domestic and EU
schemes, licensing and various other services
provided to farmers and growers.
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
The original aims of the CAP in the Treaty of
Rome (1957) were to raise the living standards
of rural people by improving productivity and
ensuring security of food supplies and stability
of markets, and to guarantee supplies to

consumers at reasonable prices. The main
means for achieving this were a combination
of support prices, import duties and market
intervention. When prices of main
commodities fell below certain agreed levels,
intervention authorities (the Intervention
Board in the UK) bought the goods and stored
them for later resale. Intervention stocks were
exported or disposed of within the EU, where
this could be done without disrupting internal
markets. The system was agreed to be
inefficient and wasteful. It distorted incentives
for farmers, raised food prices for consumers,
and encouraged surplus production. Subsidies
have driven farmers’ decisions about what
they produce. Such a system was also
expensive, absorbing at times over 70% of the
EU budget. Exports, either from the market
or from intervention stocks, attracted export
refunds (or an export tax) to fill the gap
between EU and world prices.
The reforms of 1992 have helped to cut
food mountains to manageable levels and
restrained expansion of the CAP budget.
Farmers now receive most of their financial
support in the form of direct payments from
the Exchequer under various arable and
livestock schemes (see pp. 451, 459) and much
less now comes from the consumer through
increased food prices. Conditions, in the form
of quotas at producer level or obligations to
set-aside land, are placed on those who receive
these payments, in order to control
production. The Government funds
expenditure in the UK on CAP measures and
later claims reimbursement from the EU. The
UK subscribes to this reimbursement through
payments to the EU budget, to which it is a
net contributor.
All CAP support prices and direct subsidy
payments are set in ECUs (from 1 January
1999 in euros) and are then converted into the
currencies of the member states at special rates
of exchange, so-called ‘green rates’. The green
pound was successively devalued during
1992-96 by over 20%, resulting in higher
prices and subsidies to UK producers. During
1996—98 there have been revaluations of the
green pound totalling 18.7%. The EU
agrimoney rules permit member states to
make available compensation for some of the
losses resulting from these revaluations—at
the discretion of the member state. The
Government has not taken up this choice
because of the considerable public funding
already available for the damage caused by
BSE (see p. 453) and because it does not
believe that farmers should automatically
expect subsidies to compensate for annual
variations in income. Owing to the exceptional
circumstances in the sheep and beef sectors as
a result of export difficulties, however, the
Government did make available £85 million
out of agrimoney compensation funds in 1998.
Although this was derived from EU funds,
71% of the bill has to be met by the UK
taxpayer.
Nearly all the EU’s expenditure on
agricultural support is channelled through the
European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). The Fund’s
guarantee section (with a budget of £27,462
million in 1998) finances market support
arrangements, including direct payments
made under the CAP, while the guidance
section (budget of £2,381 million in 1998)
provides funds for structural reform, for
example, hill livestock compensatory
allowances (see p. 459) and payments to assist
certain farmers to change to alternative
enterprises. The agrimonetary system will
456
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
require an overhaul to take account of the
introduction of the single currency on
1 January 1999 and of the need for a system
for the UK and other EU countries not
participating in European Monetary Union.
CAP Reform and Enlargement of the EU
In March 1998 the European Commission
published proposals for CAP reform under
Agenda 2000. This is designed to pave the way
for enlargement of the EU and to enable it to
adopt a forward-looking and sustainable
position in the forthcoming World Trade
Organisation (WTO) talks. Among the
proposals are:
• 20% cut in the cereals intervention price;
• 30% cut in the intervention price for beef
achieved over three years;
• 15% cut in support prices for milk
achieved over four years;
• milk quotas to be extended for six years
until 2006 and an increase in quotas of
2% (1% to national quotas allocated to
young farmers and 1% to mountainous
regions) in four equal instalments;
• higher status for rural development, with
many regulations being consolidated and
better integration with EU Structural
Funds for poorer regions (see p. 459);
• compensation through direct payments to
farmers based on acreage or herd sizes;
• single legal framework for farm-related
rural development and agri-environment
measures; and
• imposition of production ceilings on
farmers.
The UK has broadly welcomed the
proposals, but has criticised some parts,
particularly in the minor changes suggested
for the milk sector, as being insufficiently
radical. The UK would prefer to phase out
price and other production-related support,
thus allowing the industry to operate
competitively in world and domestic markets.
Britain would contest any attempt to impose
EU-wide ceilings on payments, because this
would discriminate against larger, more
competitive farms.
Agri-Environment Schemes
The UK’s agri-environment programme,
under EU Agri-Environment Regulation
2078/92, provides voluntary incentive
schemes to encourage environmentally
beneficial farming practices. Some 50% of
eligible government expenditure (75% in
Objective 1 areas—see p. 459) is reimbursed
by the Commission under the CAP. The
Government normally evaluates and reviews
the schemes every five years. In 1997-98,
provisional expenditure on agri-environment
schemes in the UK will be approximately £86
million. The National Agri-Environment
Forum brings together representatives of
national and local government and farming
and conservation organisations in England to
advise the Government on important issues.
The main schemes in England are the
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA)
schemes, which operate in designated areas,
and the Countryside Stewardship scheme,
which operates throughout England.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas
A national audit report of 1997 described the
voluntary ESA scheme as a landmark in the
development of policies to promote
environmentally sensitive farming. Farmers
within the designated areas receive annual
payments for agricultural practices which
benefit nature conservation, the landscape and
historic features. Payments range between £8
and £430 a hectare, and are designed to
compensate for reduced profitability as a
result of adopting less intensive production
methods. They are generally funded half by
the Government and half by the EAGGF.
Revised schemes for 11 of the English ES As,
designed to conform with the UK’s
Biodiversity Action Plan, were relaunched
in 1998.
Countryside Stewardship
Countryside Stewardship is the main
government incentive scheme for farmers in
England for the wider English countryside
outside the ESAs. During 1997 MAFF signed
nearly 1,200 new agreements with farmers in
England, bringing the total to almost 7,400,

The Arable Stewardship pilot scheme,
launched in January 1998, aims to reverse the
decline in a number of wildlife species in East
Anglia and the West Midlands, at a cost of
£0.5 million. The Government has proposed
two more grant schemes, also based on
Countryside Stewardship, to boost jobs and
protect the environment in upland England:
• in pilot areas of Bodmin Moor (Cornwall)
and Bowland (North West); and
• in heather moorland which has been
overgrazed.
Organic Aid Schemes
Agri-environment schemes are also available
to help farmers convert to organic farming.
These schemes offer support through the
conversion period when farmers suffer income
loss but cannot sell their produce as organic
and thus get better prices. The Organic Aid
Scheme (OAS) for England saw 9,454 hectares
(23,361 acres) in conversion or fully organic
by the end of 1997. Parallel schemes in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland cover 25,163
hectares (62,178 acres).2 Total expenditure for
the UK was about £705,000 in 1997-98. In
July 1998 the Government announced
increased payments to English farmers
wishing to convert from conventional to
organic farming. The changes, subject to
European Commission approval, include:
• increases in payment rates, from £250 to
£450 a hectare over five years for most

arable land and temporary grass, and
from £50 to £350 for most improved
land in the uplands;
• removal of the current ceiling of 300
hectares on the area of land that can
receive payments on any one organic
unit.
The Government also funds the Organic
Conversion Information Service, which
provides free Helpline (0117 922 7707)
information and advisory visits to prospective
organic farmers in England and Wales. Over
2,200 calls had been made to the helpline by
the end of 1997 and over 1,050 advisory visits
requested. In Scotland the Scottish
Agricultural College operates an Organic
Farming Advice Helpline (01224 711000).
The UK Register of Organic Food Standards
is charged with overseeing standards of
organic food production.
The UK market for organic food was
worth an estimated £260 million in 1997,
of which just under half was fruit and
vegetables. Imports account for about 70%
of retail sales. The UK has 0.3% of
agricultural land in organic production. In
December 1997 there were 1,026 organic
producers in the UK, and 63,000 in the
EU (0.75% of all farmers and 1.1% of
farmed land).
Other Schemes
Of the other schemes within England, the
Nitrate Sensitive Areas and the Countryside
Access and Moorland schemes are to be
458
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
closed, their successful elements being
integrated with Countryside Stewardship.
The Habitat Scheme is being reviewed.
In Scotland there are three agri¬
environment schemes: the ESAs, the OAS and
the Countryside Premium Scheme. Wales has
the ESAs, the OAS and the pilot Tir Cymen
Scheme. Northern Ireland has the ESAs, the
OAS and the Countryside Management
Scheme.
The Farm Woodland Premium Scheme
offers payments over 10 to 15 years to
compensate for income forgone from planting
trees on agricultural land. Payments are
funded 50% by the European Commission
under the CAP (75% in Objective 1 areas—
see below).
The Rural Economy and EU Structural
Funds
Northern Ireland, the Highlands and Islands
of Scotland, and Merseyside qualify for
assistance under Objective 1 of the EU
Structural Funds, which aims to help those
regions whose economic development lags
behind the EU average. Some £12 million had
been spent on measures funded under
Objective 1 in Northern Ireland by mid-1998
and about £78 million (since 1994) in
Scotland.
Eleven areas in Great Britain (including
South West England, the English Northern
Uplands, 70% of the landmass of Wales,
Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in
Scotland) are eligible to receive funds under
Objective 5b of the EU Structural Funds.
Objective 5b aims to promote the economic
development of rural areas by supporting the
provision of business advice, infrastructure
development, diversification, marketing local
and regional products, and measures to
enhance and conserve the environment. Areas
must have a high share of agricultural
employment in total employment, a low level
of agricultural income and a low population
density.
The EU has allocated £376 million to the
six Objective 5b programmes in England for
the six years 1994—99. Of this, some £112
million is to come from the Government and
the EAGGF specifically to assist the
agricultural sector. In Wales some £16 million
has been allocated for the same period; in
Scotland £8.4 million.
Integrated Administration and Control
System (IACS)
The IACS, an EU-wide anti-fraud measure,
requires farmers claiming payment under
area-based CAP schemes to submit an annual
application for aid giving field-by-field details
of their farmed land. This provides the basis
for administrative and on-farm checks on their
entitlement to aid and for cross checks
between claims under the agri-environment
and IACS schemes. Administrative checks
involve the use of a computerised database,
and on-the-spot checks are carried out
through farm visits by field officers and the
use of observation satellites.
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances
In Less Favoured Areas (LFAs), where land
quality is poor, farmers benefit from hill
livestock compensatory allowances (HLCAs).
These are headage payments on breeding
cattle and sheep, and their purpose is to
support the continuation of livestock farming
in hills and uplands, thus conserving the
countryside and encouraging people to remain
in the LFAs. The intention is to replace the
existing HLCA scheme with one better able to
maintain the environmental and social fabric
in the hills; this is being considered along with
the Agenda 2000 proposals.
Agricultural Trade Liberalisation
In the third year of the GATT Uruguay
Round implementation period, it became
apparent that the terms of the WTO
agreement on agriculture were putting
pressure on the EU’s agriculture support
policies, particularly the limits on export
subsidies. The EU has reduced export
subsidies for certain products in order to
remain within its GATT ceilings.
After a successful challenge to the WTO by
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and
the United States, in May 1997 the WTO
459
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
concluded that certain aspects of the EU
banana regime, which provided preferential
access for imports from African, Caribbean
and Pacific (ACP) countries, were
incompatible with world trade rules. The EU
was given until 1 January 1999 to put revised
import arrangements in place. A proposal to
amend the regime, by removing elements
condemned by the WTO, was presented to the
EU Agriculture Council in January 1998. The
Government made reaching agreement on
revised arrangements a priority and sought to
ensure that the interests of the UK’s traditional
suppliers in the Commonwealth Caribbean
were taken into account. Agreement to revised
arrangements which met the EU’s
commitments to the ACP countries under the
Lome Convention and its obligations to its
other trading partners in the WTO was reached
in the Agriculture Council in June 1998.
In 1997 imports of bananas into the EU
totalled 3,086,000 tonnes, with a value of
£1,206 million. Of these, 690,000 tonnes came
from ACP suppliers with traditional links to
the EU.
The EU has adopted a veterinary
equivalency agreement with New Zealand and
plans similar agreements with other countries;
in March 1998 it agreed an equivalency deal
with the United States, aimed at facilitating the
trade in animals and animal products, and
providing a framework to allow both parties to
recognise each other’s hygiene inspection rules.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in the UK in 1997-98 under the
CAP was £3,403 million; expenditure by the
agriculture and other departments (including
funding for special areas) on conservation
measures was £289 million. This represented a
decrease of some £678 million and an increase of
some £41 million respectively. The net decrease
occurred mainly because of the ending of various
schemes introduced to support the industry
during the initial stages of the BSE crisis.
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and Wales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who want
to farm on their own account. Councils may
lend working capital to them. At 31 March
1996 there were approximately 4,600
smallholdings in England and 821 in Wales.
Land settlement in Scotland has been carried
out by the Government, which still owns and
maintains 105,000 hectares (259,455 acres) of
land settlement estates, comprising 1,400
crofts and holdings.
In northern Scotland, Highland, parts of
Argyll and Bute, Western Isles, Orkney and
Shetland, much of the land is tenanted by
crofters, who enjoy the statutory protection
provided by crofting legislation and can
benefit from government agriculture and
livestock improvement schemes. Most crofters
are part-time agriculturalists, using croft
income to supplement income from other
activities. The Crofters Commission has a
statutory duty to promote their interests and
to keep all crofting matters under review. The
Transfer of Crofting Estates (Scotland) Act
1997 allows the Government to transfer some
of its own crofting land to trusts set up by
resident crofters, with the aim of giving them
more responsibility for their own affairs.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
About one-third of agricultural land in England
and Wales is rented. The Agricultural
Tenancies Act 1995 provides a simplified legal
framework for new tenancies entered into on or
after 1 September 1995, known as Farm
Business Tenancies (FBTs). In the 1997 annual
survey of tenanted land, 603 FBTs were
recorded in the sample, representing nearly
14% of all types of agreement. Landowners
benefit from full relief from inheritance tax
on FBTs.
In Scotland about 35% of farmland is rented,
partly reflecting the relatively large areas of land
in crofting tenure, including common grazings.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but the conacre system allows
occupiers not wishing to farm all their land to
let it annually to others. Conacre land, about
one-fifth of agricultural land, is used mainly for
grazing.3
3 The statistical definition of a farm in Northern Ireland was
changed in 1997; it is no longer based on landownership but
rather on separate business status as applied under the
IACS. See Digest of Agricultural Census Statistics, 1997.

Agricultural Training
Lantra, National Training Organisation Limited
provides national training (see p. 154) and other
services for agriculture and commercial
horticulture, under contract to MAFF. The
contract for the three years 1997-2000 is worth
£1.5 million and complements funding provided
by the Department for Education and
Employment, including work on the
development of national standards. Lantra
receives additional funding under the DTFs
Sector Challenge. MAFF also contributes to the
educational activities of the National Federation
of Young Farmers’ Clubs. The agricultural
colleges and other independent organisations
also provide training.
The SOAEFD, in partnership with Lantra,
with which it has a £1 million contract over
three years, opened Britain’s first national
training centre for deer farming in February
1998 at Barony College, near Dumfries. The
Scottish Meat Training Initiative, with funds of
£300,000, opened in 1997 and aims to make the
meat industry a career choice for young people.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales ADAS, privatised in
1997, provides professional, business, scientific
and technical services in the agriculture, food
and drink, and environmental markets.
Consultancy is on a fee-paying basis. The
Farming and Rural Conservancy Agency carries
out statutory work no longer undertaken by
ADAS. The Government pays for free initial
advice on conservation and the prevention of
pollution. In England this advice is provided
through ADAS and, in the case of conservation,
also through the Farming and Wildlife Advisory
Group. Similar services in Scotland come from
the SOAEFD through the Scottish Agricultural
College. In Northern Ireland they are available
from the Department of Agriculture’s
agriculture and science services.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain enforces controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including checks
on all individual consignments originating
from outside the EU and frequent checks on
those from other EU member states at
destination points. Measures can be taken to
prevent the importation of diseased animals
and genetic material from regions or countries
affected by disease. Veterinary checks also
include unannounced periods of surveillance
at ports.
The campaign to eradicate BSE is
described on pp. 453^1. In September 1998,
well in advance of the EU deadline of end-
1999, the British Cattle Movement Service
(BCMS), at Workington, began operation of
the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) for Great
Britain, a computerised venture to track all
cattle movements and to issue cattle passports.
The Government is to meet all BCMS and
CTS start-up and first-year running costs, a
benefit of about £35 million to the farming
industry. From the second year, CTS costs
are to be recovered from a charge on cattle
passports.
Funding on Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy related research across all
government departments is expected to be
about £69 million during the financial years
1998-2000.
In August 1998, the Government
announced a five-point strategy to tackle
tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. The strategy
includes significant new research aimed at
better understanding of how the disease is
transmitted; developing a cattle vaccine; and a
trial to test the effectiveness of badger culling.
Professional advice and action on the
statutory control of animal disease and the
welfare of farm livestock are the responsibility
of the State Veterinary Service. It is supported
by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, which
also offers its services to the private sector on a
commercial basis. A similar service is provided
in Scotland by the Scottish Agricultural
College and in Northern Ireland by the
Department of Agriculture’s Veterinary
Science Laboratories.
Rabies
The report of the Advisory Group on
Quarantine, which had examined the risks
associated with the UK’s policy on quarantine
461
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
for imported animals, was published in
September 1998. Its main recommendation is
that cats and dogs should be allowed to travel
into the UK from other EU member states
and specified rabies-free countries without
having to be quarantined as long as the
animals have been protected against rabies by
vaccination, are identified by micro-chips, are
blood tested and carry appropriate certificates
attesting to these precautions. The report also
recommends that up to three years should be
allowed for the introduction of the new
system. The Government is sympathetic to
change along these lines. It has invited the
views of the public and interested
organisations, with a deadline for comments of
31 December 1998, and is drawing up plans to
implement the report’s recommendations.
Pesticides
There is rigorous evaluation of new and
existing pesticides under UK and developing
EU legislation. The Pesticides Safety
Directorate, an executive agency of MAFF, is
responsible for the evaluation and approval of
agricultural pesticides in Great Britain. The
Government monitors pesticide residues in
food, incidents involving people, and wildlife
and pesticide usage to ensure that approved
pesticides are safe to use. The Pesticides Act
1998 opens the way to improving
arrangements for public access to information
and extending to local authorities certain
powers to seize and dispose of pesticides.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate
(VMD), an executive agency of MAFF, is
responsible to agriculture and health ministers
for ensuring that authorised veterinary
medicinal products meet standards of safety,
quality and efficacy. Safety of consumers of
food from treated animals, users of medicines,
the health and welfare of treated animals, and
the environment are all matters of concern.
The independent scientific Veterinary
Products Committee advises the Government.
It has reviewed the use of synthetic pyrethroid
sheep dips, in particular their impact on the
environment. The VMD also runs a
surveillance programme to detect residues of
veterinary medicines in foodstuffs, and the
results are widely disseminated.
The Fishing Industry
According to the UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation, although world fish production
rose from 85.6 million tonnes in 1995 to 87.1
million tonnes in 1996, catches in what were
the world’s most productive oceans have been
in decline for more than 20 years. Tuna
stocks, for example, are fully or overfished in
most sectors.
In 1997 the British fishing industry provided
about 56.5% by quantity of total UK fish
supplies. Household consumption of fish in the
UK, at 447,928 tonnes (provisional figures),
showed a decrease of 4.7% since 1996.
Fisheries departments are responsible for
the administration of legislation, in
partnership with the European Commission,
concerning the fishing industry, including fish
and shellfish farming. The Sea Fish Industry
Authority is an industry-financed body which
undertakes R&D, provides training, promotes
the marketing of sea fish and gives financial
assistance to the fishing industry.
Fish Caught
In 1997 demersal fish (caught on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 55% by
weight of total landings by British fishing
vessels, pelagic fish (caught near the surface)
for 23% and shellfish for 21%. Landings of all
types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by
British fishing vessels into the UK totalled
602,700 tonnes compared with 635,900 tonnes
in 1996. Cod and haddock represented 15%
and 10% respectively of the total value of
demersal and pelagic fish landed. The
quayside value of landings of all sea fish,
including shellfish, by British vessels in 1997
was £468 million.
The Fishing Fleet
The fisheries departments and the Scottish
Fisheries Protection Agency currently spend
462
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
some £25 million a year on fisheries
enforcement, primarily on monitoring the
application of the Common Fisheries Policy
(CFP) and ensuring that measures designed to
conserve fish stocks and to safeguard the long¬
term interests of the industry are respected.
All British vessels fishing for profit must be
licensed by the fisheries departments. To help
conserve stocks and contain the size of the
fleet only replacement licences are issued.
Quotas are allocated annually between fishing
companies and other groups of fishermen,
primarily on the basis of historic catches. In
1997, only 3 out of the UK’s 77 quotas were
exceeded, but none by more than 105%.
During 1997 a total of 2,703 infringements of
EU fishing regulations were detected in
respect of 1,220 vessels. The masters and/or
owners of some 207 vessels were prosecuted
for 482 infringements detected in 1997 and
earlier years.
A satellite monitoring system, to track the
movements of EU vessels over 24 m, as well as
those from third countries fishing in EU
waters, will be fully operational by 1 January
2000. A system of designated landing ports for
all non-pelagic landings made by vessels of 20
m and over has been proposed. These vessels
account for over 70% of the total tonnage and
64% of the total value of non-pelagic landings
into the UK made by the over 10-m fleet.
Failure to comply with the arrangements
would be a breach of a vessel’s licence and a
reportable offence which could lead to a fine
of up to £50,000.
Britain aims to achieve the EU target for
reducing its fleet through cutting its numbers
and limiting the time vessels spend at sea. A
further 2% of tonnage (104 vessels; 4,215
tonnes) was removed in 1997, at a cost of £13.9
million. At the end of 1997 the UK fleet
consisted of 7,812 registered vessels, including
281 deep-sea vessels longer than 27 m (88.5 ft).
Fish Farming and Shellfish Production
The Highlands and Islands, from Argyll to
Shetland, produce the largest amount of
farmed salmon (with a first-sale value of £220
million) in the EU: just under 100,000 tonnes
of salmon and about 5,000 tonnes of trout in
1997. Fish farmers at Loch Ailort in Lochaber
have successfully reared a new species of
farmed halibut, which commands a price up to
four times that of farmed salmon. Shellfish
farming in Scotland produced about 1,400
tonnes. The combined turnover of the
industry is about £260 million; the salmon
industry has a first-sale value of some £250
million.
Fishery Limits
British fishery limits extend to 200 miles or
the median line (broadly halfway between the
UK coast and the opposing coastline of
another coastal state), measured from
baselines on or near the coast of Britain.
Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)
The EU’s CFP system for the conservation
and management of fishing resources sets total
allowable catches (TACs) each year in order to
conserve stocks. TACs are then allocated as
quotas between member states, taking account
of traditional fishing patterns. In December
1997, the EU agreed total 1998 quotas for the
UK of 540,000 tonnes, expressed as cod
equivalent, compared with 485,000 tonnes in
1997. Of this increase, 24,000 tonnes were the
result of introducing new quotas; the
remainder reflected the improved stocks of
North Sea herring, North Sea cod and
mackerel.
British vessels have exclusive rights to fish
within 6 miles of the British coast. Certain
other EU member states have historic rights in
British waters between 6 and 12 miles. British
vessels have similar rights in other member
states’ 6 to 12 mile belts. Between 12 and 200
miles, EU vessels may fish wherever they have
access rights. Non-EU countries’ vessels may
fish in these waters if they negotiate reciprocal
fisheries agreements.
Technical conservation measures
supplement TAC and effort controls. They
include minimum mesh sizes for nets and net
configuration restrictions, minimum landing
sizes and closed areas designed mainly to
protect young fish.
Each member state is responsible for
enforcement of CFP rules on its own
fishermen and those of other member states in

Grant Schemes
The UK fishing industry benefited from some
£50 million in fisheries grants over the
financial years 1995-96 to 1997-98. Grants
available include schemes for vessel
modernisation, aquaculture, decommissioning
of fishing vessels, improvement of port
facilities, and the processing, marketing and
promotion of fisheries and aquaculture
produce.
Fisheries Agreements
CFP provisions are supplemented by a
number of fisheries agreements between the
EU and third countries, the most important
for the UK being the agreements with
Norway, Greenland and the Faroes. EU catch
quotas have also been established around
Spitsbergen (Svalbard).
Fish and Shellfish Hygiene
EU legislation sets minimum hygiene
standards for the production and marketing of
fish and shellfish. All commercial shellfish
beds producing live bivalve molluscs are
monitored and classified according to the
degree to which samples taken from them
contain microbiological contamination. This
determines whether the shellfish can go
directly for human consumption or must be
treated beforehand. Samples of seawater and
shellfish flesh are regularly tested for the
presence of biotoxins and chemical
contaminants.
Salmon, Freshwater Fisheries and the
Aquatic Environment
Salmon stocks, particularly spring salmon, are
at unprecedentedly low levels throughout
their range in the North Atlantic, including
Great Britain, and urgent consideration is
being given to what measures might be taken
to reduce exploitation. Changes in sea
temperatures, global warming, water quantity
and quality, and changes in farming practices
are among the causes of the decline. The
Environment Agency, which is responsible for
day-to-day management in England and
Wales, is preparing action plans for the major
salmon rivers.
There is no public right to fish in
freshwater lakes and non-tidal rivers in Great
Britain. Those wishing to fish such waters
must first obtain permission from the owner
of the fishing rights and, in England and
Wales, a licence from the Environment
Agency. In Scotland salmon fisheries are
managed locally by District Salmon Fishery
464
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
Boards. In Northern Ireland fishing for
freshwater species is licensed by the Fisheries
Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland and
the Foyle Fisheries Commission in their
respective areas, and 62 public angling waters,
including salmon, trout and coarse fisheries,
are available to Department of Agriculture
permit holders.
Research
Departmental funding of R&D in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 1998-99 includes funding
by MAFF (£129 million), the SOAEFD (£47
million), and the Department of Agriculture
for Northern Ireland (£8 million).
Agriculture and Food
In 1998-99 MAFF will spend about £11
million on R&D in the horticulture industry,
contributing £0.7 million to the LINK
programme (see p. 417), jointly funded with
industry. It is continuing R&D into the e-coli
0157 organism and into what farmers can do
to reduce its entry into the human food chain.
In 1997 MAFF’s Food Chemical Surveillance
Programme, costing £9.5 million, aiming to
ensure that the food eaten by British
consumers is safe, nutritious and authentic,
carried out 176,000 tests on 60,000 food
samples.
Research Bodies
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC; see p. 426)
supports research in biotechnology and
biological sciences related to food and
agriculture. The Natural Environment
Research Council includes some agricultural
aspects in its remit. Research institutes
sponsored by these councils receive income
from work commissioned by MAFF, industry
and other bodies.
ADAS carries out R&D, at a network of
research centres and on clients’ premises, for
MAFF and other organisations and
companies. There are research centres across
England and Wales. MAFF receives scientific
expertise and technical support from its other
agencies, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency
and the Central Science Laboratory,
commissioning research from them as well as
through open competition. Horticulture
Research International, a non-departmental
public body, transfers the results of its R&D
to the British horticulture industry and the
wider public.
The five Scottish Agricultural and
Biological Research Institutes, funded by the
SOAEFD, cover areas of research relevant to
the conditions of northern Britain. The
SOAEFD also funds agricultural research,
education and advisory services at the Scottish
Agricultural College, which operates from
three centres. In Northern Ireland the
Department of Agriculture maintains an
integrated Science and Technology
programme to improve the economic
performance of the agri-food, fishing and
forestry sectors, to conserve the rural
environment and to strengthen the economy
and social infrastructure of disadvantaged
rural areas. Research and other work are
carried out at the Queen’s University of
Belfast.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2.5 million
hectares (6.2 million acres) in the UK: a little
less than 8% of England, nearly 16% of
Scotland, 12% of Wales and 6% of Northern
Ireland. This is under 11% of the total land
area and well below the 30% average for the
whole of Europe.
Britain’s forestry programme aims to
protect and expand forest resources and
conserve woodland as a home for wildlife and
for public recreation. It also promotes the
market for home-grown timber.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2.2 million hectares (5.5 million
acres), 35% of which is managed by the
Forestry Commission. The rate of new
planting (including natural regeneration) in
1997-98 was 131 hectares (324 acres) by the
Commission and 15,912 hectares (39,319
acres) by other woodland owners, with the
help of grants from the Commission, mainly
in Scotland. In 1997-98, 9,411 hectares
(23,255 acres) of broadleaved trees were
465
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
planted, a practice encouraged on suitable
sites.
Forestry and primary wood processing
employ about 35,000 people. Great Britain’s
woodlands produced 9.05 million cubic metres
(320 million cubic feet) of timber in 1997,
15% of total UK consumption. Provision has
been made for new planting in Great Britain
amounting to 63,500 hectares (156,900 acres)
in the three years 1997—98 to 1999—2000,
comprising 62,800 hectares (155,185 acres) by
the private sector and 700 hectares (1,730
acres) by Forest Enterprise (see below).
The volume of timber harvested on
Commission lands in 1997-98 was estimated
at 4.66 million cubic metres (164 million cubic
feet).
The Commission’s Woodland Grant
Scheme pays grants (£35.4 million in
1997-98) to help create new woodlands and
forests, and regenerate existing ones. Under
the scheme a management grant is available
for work in woods of special conservation and
landscape value or where the public are
welcome.
The Forestry Commission and Forestry
Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in
1919, is the government department
responsible for forestry in Great Britain. With
1.06 million hectares of land (2.6 million
acres), it is the UK’s largest land manager and
the biggest single provider of countryside
recreation. The Commissioners advise on
forestry matters and are responsible to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the
Secretary of State for Wales.
The Commission provides grants to
private woodland owners for tree planting
and woodland management, controls tree
felling, and sets standards for the forestry
industry as a whole. Forest Enterprise, an
agency of the Commission, develops and
manages the Commission’s forests and
forestry estate, supplying timber and
opportunities for recreation, and enhancing
nature conservation and the forest
environment. Forest Research is the R&D
agency of the Commission.
The Commission is financed partly by the
Government and partly by receipts from sales
of timber and other produce, and from rents.
Its grant in aid for 1997-98 was £58 million,
from which £9 million will be deducted for
reimbursement of EU co-financing of private
woodlands grants.
In 1998, after wide consultation, the
Commission and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland published a
UK Forestry Standard to establish a
framework for British forestry, in accordance
with international protocols for defining and
monitoring sustainable forestry. It
• protects sites of special wildlife,
landscape and cultural value, and
endangered habitats and species;
• promotes sound management of forests
for productive and environmental
benefits;
• encourages the involvement of local
people and organisations as part of forest
planning; and
• recommends literature which describes
such imperatives as protection of soil and
water, and promotion of greater diversity
in uniform plantations.
The Government has imposed a
moratorium on large-scale forest sales. During
1989-90 to 1997-98, 76,430 hectares (188,859
acres) were sold. Total sales since 1981
amount to £258.1 million.
Forestry Initiatives
In 1998 the Commission created a Land
Regeneration Unit, to encourage the planting
of millions of trees on former coal tips and
other derelict land across England. With an
estimated 1,000 sq km (386 sq miles) of
damaged land to be thus developed, the initial
focus will be on the creation of new woodlands
(of 30 hectares—74 acres—or larger) in the
central English coalfields and on wider plans
to create working forests of about 800—1,200
hectares (1,980—2,970 acres). The planned
National Forest in England (520 sq km—200
sq miles) will cover parts of Staffordshire,
Derbyshire and Leicestershire, with the aim of
increasing woodland from 6% to a third of its
466
AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
area. About 70% of the new planting should
take place by 2005.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
Woodland and forest cover about 81,000
hectares (200,000 acres) of Northern Ireland.
State-owned forest constitutes 61,000 hectares
(150,700 acres).
The Forest Service is an executive agency
within the Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland and is responsible for
promoting the interests of forestry. It
administers grant aid for private planting and
spent £15.6 million during 1994—97
supporting private and state forestry.
Additional supplements are available where
the land is coming out of agriculture or
provides recreation. Timber production in
1997-98 was about 225,000 cubic metres
(9 million cubic feet), 90% from state forests.
Receipts from sales of timber totalled about
£6.1 million. Forestry and timber processing
employ 1,100 people.

28 Manufacturing and
Construction
Introduction 468 Construction 485
Sectors of Manufacturing 468
Manufacturing continues to play an important role in the modern economy,
although services now generate about three times as much gross domestic
product (GDP) and four times as much employment. The UK excels in
industries such as chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, electronics, motor
vehicles and components, aerospace, offshore equipment, and paper and
printing, where British companies are among the world’s largest and most
successful. Britain’s construction industry has made its mark around the world
and continues to be involved in some of the most celebrated building projects
both at home and abroad.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for 20.5% of gross
value added (at current basic prices) in 1997
and for 18% of employment—4 million, with
the East Midlands and West Midlands having
the highest proportion of manufacturing
employees (26% in June 1998) and London
the lowest (8%). Almost all manufacturing is
carried out by private sector businesses.
Overseas companies have a strong presence
(see p. 410), being responsible for a quarter of
net manufacturing output in the UK.
The recession in the early 1990s led to a
decline in manufacturing output, but it began
to rise again in 1993. By 1997 the volume of
output was 3.8% above the 1990 level.
However, it has recently been growing at a
modest rate, and in the second quarter of 1998
was 0.7% up on the same period in 1997.
Some industries, including chemicals and
electrical engineering, have achieved
substantial growth rates following the
recession, but output of other sectors,
including metals and metal products (except
steel, where recent output has exceeded 1990
levels), wood and wood products, and textiles
and clothing, remains well below their 1990
levels.
The construction industry contributed
around 5.2% of gross value added in 1997.
Following a period of marked decline as
recession affected the industry in the early
1990s, output has picked up since 1993 while
remaining below pre-recession levels.

obtained from the Department of Trade and
Industry or the appropriate trade association.
The variations usually reflect differences in
coverage of the industry concerned. It is also
to be noted that the value of exports can
include that of re-exports of imported and
factored goods, and can exceed the sales values
quoted.
Food, Drink and Tobacco
The UK has a comprehensive food and drink
manufacturing and processing industry, which
has accounted for a growing proportion of
total domestic food supply since the 1940s.
The largest concentration of enterprises is to
be found in the production of bread, cakes and
fresh pastry goods, followed by those engaged
in processing and preserving fruit and
vegetables. The South East provides the
greatest number of food-based jobs (16% of
the total); other areas with large numbers of
such jobs are Yorkshire and Humberside and
the North West. Spirits production gives
Scotland the highest concentration of
employment in the drinks manufacturing
industry (36% of the total), with a significant
proportion of jobs in economically deprived
rural areas; the South East has the second
highest concentration (16%) of drinks-related
jobs. By far the biggest food and drinks export
category is alcoholic drinks, which account for
nearly a third of the value of total food and
drink sales overseas. The Scotch whisky
industry is one of the UK’s top export earners,
with overseas sales worth £2,394 million in
1997. Gin and vodka production are also
important parts of the spirits industry.
Among the biggest companies involved in
food manufacturing and processing are
Unilever, Northern Foods, Unigate,
Hazlewood Foods, Tate and Lyle, Cadbury
Schweppes, Associated British Foods, the
Tomkins Group (see p. 471) and United
Biscuits. In December 1997 Guinness and
Grand Metropolitan merged to form Diageo,
which in 1997-98 had a turnover of £12,000
million and around 77,000 employees. It is one
of the world’s leading producers of spirits and
also has other extensive food and drink
interests, including Burger King, the world’s
second largest restaurant chain. Allied
Domecq is also among the world’s leading
alcoholic drinks companies, with significant
operations in wines and spirits and in retailing.
Alongside these large concerns, there is a
thriving specialist food and drink sector made
up of a host of small and medium-sized firms
(SMEs) supplying high-quality ‘niche’
products, often to small retail outlets, such as
delicatessens.
Frozen foods and chilled convenience
foods, such as frozen potato products and
ready-prepared meals, salads and pasta,
together with yogurts, desserts and ‘instant
snacks’, have formed some of the fastest-
growing sectors of the food market in recent
years. The range of ready-cooked meals is
expanding rapidly. Many new low-fat and fat-
free items are being introduced, ranging from
dairy products to complete prepared meals,
and organic foods are also becoming more
widely available. There has also been a

substantial rise in sales of vegetarian foods
(both natural vegetable dishes and vegetable-
based substitutes of meat products, where soya
plays a big role). For genetically modified
foods, see chapter 27.
Around 35% of liquid milk in the UK is
distributed through a doorstep delivery system
employing about 15,000 people; the proportion
is, however, declining. Household consumption
of liquid wholemilk (including low-fat) per
head—1.83 litres (3.21 pints) a week—is
among the highest in the world. Consumption
of skimmed and semi-skimmed milk continues
to rise as people seek to reduce the fat content
in their diet. The British dairy industry
accounts for about 79% of butter and 67% of
cheese supplies to the domestic market and
achieves significant sales in overseas markets.
Household sales of bread and morning
goods (including rolls, croissants, scones, tea¬
cakes, etc.) totalled over £2,362 million in
1997. The Tomkins Group own Ranks Hovis
McDougall Ltd, British Bakeries and the
largest plant cake producer in the UK (Manor
Bakeries/Mr Kipling/Lyons cakes). A feature
of the bread-making market is a move towards
production in in-store bakeries, notably in
supermarkets. Part-baked bread (which allows
newly baked bread to be available throughout
the day in a matter of minutes) is sold, for
example, to in-store bakeries and restaurants.
Other trends have been a steady increase in
the varieties available, including premium
breads, and the growth of the sandwich
market. Sales of ready-made sandwiches
(through major multiples and sandwich bars,
etc.) are now worth £2,600 million a year.
The brewing industry has six major
national brewery groups—Scottish Courage,
Bass, Whitbread, Carlsberg-Tetley, Guinness
and Anheuser Busch—and 545 regional and
local brewers of beer. British malt, which is
made almost entirely from home-grown
barley, is used by brewers throughout the
world. Lager now accounts for nearly 60% of
all beer sales, but there is still a big demand
for the vast range of traditional cask-
conditioned and brewery conditioned ales and
stouts. Recently there has been a shift towards
stronger bottled beers, a significant proportion
of which are imported. Another recent trend
has been a sizeable import (not always legal) of
Some 12,400 people work in the Scotch
whisky industry and a further 50,000 are
employed in associated sectors, for
instance supplying ingredients and
materials. About 90% of Scotch whisky
production is exported, the European
Union (EU) taking 36%, the United States
12% and Japan 4% by volume. There are

and rationalising their brewing and
distribution facilities to meet the changing
pattern of demand, while also taking action to
develop their public houses (‘pubs’) and

‘branded’ or ‘themed’ pubs and restaurants.
Cider is made primarily in south-west
England, and in Gloucestershire,
Herefordshire and Worcestershire.
Some 400 vineyards and 115 wineries,
mainly in southern England, produce an
average of 2 million litres of wine a year, most
of which is white. Quality has steadily
improved through the use of new technologies
and winemaking techniques.
The soft drinks industry produces
carbonated drinks, concentrates, fruit juices,
and natural mineral and bottled waters. The
UK market is worth more than £400 million a
year. A highly competitive industry, it is one
of the fastest-growing sectors of the grocery
trade, responsible for introducing many
innovative products each year. Bottled waters
are experiencing the fastest growth within the
soft drinks sector; in 1997 the British
consumed 784 million litres, compared with
100 million in 1986.
Tobacco

sold in the UK. The market is supplied by
three major producers—Gallaher, Imperial
Tobacco and Rothmans (UK) Ltd. British
American Tobacco is a major manufacturer,
although it does not market its products in the
UK, and provides 13% of the world’s
cigarette supply—712,000 million cigarettes in
1997. The industry specialises in the
production of high-quality cigarettes made
from flue-cured tobacco, and achieves
significant export sales—£1,226 million in
1997. Europe, the Middle East and Africa are
important overseas markets.
Textiles, Clothing and Footwear
Annual turnover in the UK textiles, clothing
and footwear industry is around £20,000
million, and about 426,000 people are
employed. The sector has been significantly
affected by competition from imported goods,
and in 1997 the volume of sales was 13%
below the level of 1990. To meet the intense
competition, UK textile and clothing
manufacturers have modernised and
rationalised their domestic operations, and in
some cases have invested in production
facilities abroad. In addition, firms are shifting
to higher-value products, to benefit from the
UK’s strengths in fashion, design and
information technology. New technologies,
largely designed to improve response times
and give greater flexibility in production, are
being used throughout the industries. British
textile firms remain world leaders in wool and
worsted and technical textiles.
For textiles, there is a high degree of
regional concentration: cotton textiles in the
North West, fine knitwear in Scotland, linen
in Northern Ireland, woollens and worsteds in
Yorkshire, and knitwear in the East Midlands.
The clothing industry is more dispersed
throughout the UK, with significant
concentrations in the West Midlands, and
north and east London. The principal textile
and clothing products are spun textile fibres,
woven and knitted fabrics, household and
industrial textiles, carpets based chiefly on
wool, cotton and synthetic fibres, as well as a
full range of clothing and footwear.
The UK textile and clothing industries
comprise a few substantial multi-process
companies, but are mainly dominated by small
and medium-sized firms, some of which
subcontract work to other companies or to
home workers. Raw wool is scoured and
cleaned in the UK in preparation for woollen
and worsted spinning and weaving. (Worsted
is fine wool fabric often used for making
suits.) British mills also process rare fibres
such as cashmere and angora. Production
includes yarn and fabrics of cotton, synthetic
fibres and cotton-synthetic mixes, with large-
scale dyeing and printing of cotton and
synthetic fibre fabric. The high quality and
variety of design make the UK one of the
world’s leading producers of woven carpets.
Industrial textiles account for an increasing
proportion of textile industry output, covering
such items as conveyor belting and geotextiles
used in civil engineering. Many of these are
non-woven. Synthetic polypropylene yarn is

The clothing industry is more labour-
intensive than textiles. While a broad range of
clothing is imported from Europe and Asia,
British industry supplies about one-half of
domestic demand. Exports have risen since
the British fashion designer industry regained
prominence during the 1980s, and traditional
design and high-quality production enable
branded clothing companies such as Daks
Simpson and Jaeger to compete successfully
overseas. UK firms have had particular
success in the growing market for branded
street and club wear.
Output of footwear and leather goods has
been particularly affected by the pressure of
imports, and production in the first quarter of
1998 was about 20% lower than in 1990.
Footwear manufacturers, with around 22,000
employees, are predominantly found in
Northamptonshire, Somerset, Leicestershire
and Lancashire; they include C. & J. Clark,
Church and R. Griggs (makers of the ‘Dr
Martens’ range, nearly 80% of which is
exported, especially to the United States).
Paper, Publishing and Printing
The UK paper and board sector has a small
number of large firms—98 paper and board
mills, employing 23,000 people—whereas
printing in particular has a very large number
of small businesses. Paper and board are
produced for further industrial processing,
corrugated paper, sacks, bags, cartons, boxes,
household goods, stationery and a host of
other articles. Production has been
concentrated in large-scale units to enable the
industry to compete more effectively; between
1987 and 1997 output increased by a fifth.
Over half the industry is made up of forestry
product companies from Scandinavia, North
America, Australia and elsewhere. Among the
biggest British-owned groups are Shotton,
St Regis and Bridgewater. There has been a
significant trend towards waste-based
packaging grades. Usage of recycled waste
paper is increasing, with this providing more
than half of the industry’s fibrous raw
materials.
Much publishing and printing employment
and output is carried out in firms based in
south-east England. Mergers have led to the
formation of large groups in newspaper,
magazine and book publishing. Pearson
announced its acquisition of Simon &
Schuster of New York in 1998, so that it now
controls the world’s leading educational
publishing business. The British book¬
publishing industry is a major exporter; in
1997 it issued 100,029 new titles.
The UK printing industry has an annual
turnover of around £12,800 million and
employs 170,000 people. It is undergoing
significant technological change, with digital
technology enabling much greater automation
and standardisation, while colour printing is
becoming cheaper and more widely available.
The UK runs a notable trade surplus in
printing matter—about £670 million in 1997.

Chemicals and Chemical Products
The chemicals industry is one of the UK’s
largest manufacturing sectors and the seventh
largest chemicals industry in the world. It has
annual sales of £35,000 million and is also
important to the UK’s external trade, with
exports exceeding imports by about £4,200
million in 1997. It directly employs 240,000
people and sustains many more in service and
downstream industries.
The range of products manufactured by the
chemical sector is huge, ranging from
pharmaceuticals, soaps and agrochemicals to
dyes, paints and gases. Though some are sold
directly to the end-user, the bulk of
production forms an essential input to much
of the rest of the UK’s manufacturing
industry.
Oil is the feedstock for most bulk organic
chemicals, with a main use being the
manufacture of plastics. The most important
bulk products are ethylene, propylene and
benzene. Inorganic chemicals are commonly of
mineral origin; they include sulphuric acid,
chlorine and a range of metallic and non-
metallic compounds, such as caustic soda and
hydrogen peroxide, many serving as basic
materials for industry. The UK is one of the
world’s biggest producers of specialised
organic chemicals, used in the making of
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, electronic
chemicals and other products.
The industry’s largest markets are plastics
processing, packaging, agriculture, the
National Health Service, and the textiles and
clothing industries. It is at the forefront of
modern technology, spending about 7% of
total sales on research and development
(R&D) in 1997.
Many major chemical companies in the UK
are multinationals; several are subsidiaries of
overseas companies and others are specialist
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, such as
Glaxo Wellcome (see p. 475). Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI) is one of the world’s
largest chemicals groups, being one of the
biggest paint manufacturers (with operations
in 25 countries) and with particular strengths
in acrylics and polyurethanes. In 1997 it
purchased Unilever’s speciality chemicals
business, and is now concentrating operations
in three main areas: coatings (paints),
speciality products and materials.
BOC, the industrial gases group, is also one
of the UK’s largest chemicals companies.
Zeneca produces pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and seeds, and speciality
chemicals. Laporte is one of Europe’s biggest
speciality chemicals firms. BP and Shell, along
with several other large oil and gas companies,
are major producers of petrochemicals.
Teesside, which has been particularly
successful in attracting investment from some
of the leading domestic and overseas chemical
firms, now rivals Rotterdam as Europe’s
largest petrochemicals zone. Grangemouth in
Scotland is also an important petrochemicals
zone.
The agrochemicals sector invests heavily in
R&D. Notable discoveries include diquat and
paraquat herbicides, pyrethroid insecticides,
systemic fungicides and aphicides, genetically
engineered microbial pesticides and methods
of encouraging natural parasites to eradicate
common pests in horticulture.
The soap and detergent preparations
sectors are dominated by Lever Brothers (part

Pharmaceuticals
The British pharmaceuticals industry, which
is largely based in the South East and North
West, is the world’s fourth biggest exporter of
medicines, accounting for about 12% of the
world export market. It manufactures the
complete range of medicinal products—
human and veterinary medicines, medical
dressings and dental materials. In recent
times, the largest growth has been in
medicines that act on the respiratory system,
followed by cardiovascular, muscular and
skeletal, anti-infective and alimentary tract
remedies. Pharmaceutical exports in 1997
reached £5,483 million. The main overseas
markets are Western Europe and North
America, with Japan an expanding market.
Over 400 pharmaceutical manufacturers
and research organisations operate in the UK,
including several British and US parent
multinationals which dominate production.
Glaxo Wellcome (with about 52,500 people
operating in 57 countries) is the largest UK
company in terms of market capitalisation (see
p. 432) and two other pharmaceuticals firms—
SmithKline Beecham and Zeneca—feature in
the top 20 UK companies.
Some 60,000 people work in the
pharmaceuticals industry, of whom about a
third are engaged in R&D; another 250,000
are employed in related sectors. The industry
invested £2,200 million in R&D in 1997,
about one-fifth of British industry’s total R&D
expenditure. Glaxo Wellcome, SmithKline
Beecham and Zeneca are the UK’s top three
companies in terms of R&D expenditure (see
Table 25.1, p. 415). US group Pfizer has
announced that it is to invest a further £109
million to expand its Kent medicines research
centre.
Major developments pioneered in the UK
are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for ulcers, asthma, arthritis,
migraine and coronary heart disease. British
firms discovered and developed four of the
world’s 20 best-selling medicines. Among
current best-selling drugs produced by the
three largest UK companies are:
• Glaxo Wellcome—Zantac (for treating
ulcers), with worldwide sales of £1,400
million in 1997, Imigran (migraine),
Zofran (for countering the unpleasant
side-effects of cancer treatment),
Serevent (respiratory disease) and Epivir
(HIV/AIDS);
• SmithKline Beecham—Augmentin (for
treating a range of infections), with sales
of £925 million in 1997, Seroxat/Paxil
(for depression) and Relifex/Relafen (for
arthritis); and
• Zeneca—Zestril and Tenormin (for
combating high blood pressure), Zoladex
(a prostate cancer therapy) and Diprivan
(an anaesthetic).
Biotechnology
The UK biotechnology industry is second
only to that of the United States, employing
over 10,000 people and achieving yearly sales
of about £4,000 million. As well as Zeneca,
Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham,
there are some 250 smaller independent firms
(about a quarter of the number in Europe),
with particular strengths in
biopharmaceuticals. The industry is heavily
dependent on British universities’
considerable expertise in biotechnology.
Important R&D activities include gene
therapy, combinatorial chemistry, regulation
of the cell cycle, and the development of
transgenic animals as sources of organs and as
bioreactors.
Man-made Fibres
Synthetic fibres are supplied to the textiles,
clothing and footwear industries. The main
types of synthetic fibre are still those first
developed in the 1940s: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major synthetic
fibres like nylon polyamide, polyester and
acrylics. Extensive research continues to
produce a wide variety of innovative products;
antistatic and flame-retardant fibres are
examples. More specialist products include
the aramids (with very high thermal stability
475

and strength), elastanes (giving very high
stretch and recovery) and melded fabrics
(produced without the need for knitting or
weaving).
Courtaulds, one of the biggest chemical
companies in the UK, has manufacturing
facilities in 28 countries. It was responsible
for developing the first new artificial fibre
for decades, Tencel, a solvent-spun,
biodegradable fibre, which is twice as strong as
cotton but soft enough to be used by designers
of luxury garments. In 1998 Courtaulds was
acquired by Akzo Nobel of the Netherlands.
Rubber and Plastics Products
Over 280,000 people are employed by over
6,800 enterprises in the rubber and plastics
industries. Rubber products include tyres and
tubes, pipes, hoses, belting and floor
coverings, and have applications in the
automotive industry. The largest firms in this
sector include major tyre manufacturers Avon
and Michelin. The highest concentrations of
plastics employment are in the South East
(with 26% of total employment), the West
Midlands and the North West. Plastics have a
plethora of applications in the packaging,
building, electrical and electronic, transport,
medical, household goods and clothing
industries. The UK’s plastics industry
continues to be a world leader in material
specification and design, with new processes
allowing stronger plastics to replace traditional
materials and develop new applications.
Among the larger firms in a sector
characterised by many small and medium¬
sized businesses is British Polythene
Industries, Europe’s biggest producer of
polyethylene film, manufacturing products
such as carrier bags, sacks and shrink film. In
the moulded plastics sector, Linpac’s output
includes food packaging and components for
the automotive sector.
Glass, Ceramics and Building Materials
The UK is a world leader in the manufacture
of glass used in windows, doors and cladding.
Flat glass is made through the float glass
process, which was developed by Pilkington
Brothers and is licensed to glassmakers
throughout the world. About half of
Pilkington’s sales are in glass products for
buildings, while the company is the world’s
largest supplier of glass for cars, with about
one-quarter of vehicles containing its glass.
The manufacture and supply of windows and
doors are carried out by a large number of
other companies operating in one of three
product sectors—timber, metal (aluminium
and steel) and UP VC.
The ceramics industry manufactures
domestic ceramic tableware, as well as
durables such as sanitaryware, tiles and clay
pipes for the building trade. It is heavily
concentrated in the West Midlands. Domestic
tableware production includes fine china, bone
china, earthenware and stoneware. Tableware
is produced predominantly in Stoke-on-
Trent. The UK is one of the world’s leading
manufacturers and exporters of fine bone
china: Wedgwood, Spode and Royal Doulton
are among the most famous names. Research
is being conducted into ceramics for use in
housebuilding and diesel and jet engines (see
p. 484). Important industrial ceramics
invented in the UK include some forms of
silicon carbide and sialons, which can
withstand ultra-high temperatures.
Most crushed rock, sand and gravel
quarried by the aggregates industry (with a
total volume of 218 million tonnes in 1997) is
used in construction. The brick industry, one

Glass-reinforced cement composites for the
construction industry were invented in the
UK in the early 1970s and are made under
licence in over 40 countries. Blue Circle is the
UK’s largest producer of cement.
The UK is a major exporter of china clay
(kaolin—2 million tonnes in 1997), three-
quarters of which is used in paper-making.
The main producer is ECC International, part
of the English China Clays Group.
Metals and Fabricated Metal Products
The Industrial Revolution in the UK was
based to a considerable extent on the
manufacture of iron and steel and heavy
machinery. These sectors remain important
parts of the industrial economy. The major
areas of steel production are in south Wales
and northern England, with substantial
processing in the Midlands and Yorkshire.
Major restructuring in the steel industry took
place during the 1980s and early 1990s. The
industry now ranks as one of the world’s three
most productive steel sectors. Metals can be
recycled many times: every year the British
metals recycling industry processes about 9
million tonnes of scrap metal.
From total crude steel output of 18.5
million tonnes, British producers delivered
17.1 million tonnes of finished steel in 1997, of
which 50% was exported to nearly 200
countries. Two-thirds goes to other EU
member states and Germany is the UK’s
biggest market. Over the past ten years annual
steel industry exports have increased by
47%—to £3,281 million in 1997, creating a
value added to the UK economy (steel exports
minus cost of raw materials) of £1,900 million.
British Steel is the fifth largest steel producer
in the world, employing 48,400 people
worldwide (of whom 38,000 are in the UK)
and producing 84% of the UK’s crude steel in
1997. The company’s output is based on semi¬
finished steel, strip mill products, plate, heavy
sections, bars, wire rod and tubes. These are
used principally in the construction,
automotive, engineering, transport, metal
goods, packaging and energy industries.
British Steel is Europe’s biggest producer of
engineering steels—specialist grades used to
make components for the automotive and
aerospace industries. It owns 51% of Avesta
Sheffield, one of Europe’s leading stainless
steel producers.
Products manufactured by UK companies
include reinforcing bars for the construction
industry, wire rod, hot rolled and cold
finished bars, and other special steels for the
aerospace and offshore oil and gas industries.

Steel has had notable success in UK
construction, with its market share of buildings
of two or more storeys almost doubling from
30% in the early 1980s to nearly 60% today. It
has 90% of the single storey market. Total
sector sales are about £2,000 million a year and
consumption of constructional steelwork over
12 million tonnes.
Several multinational companies, including
Alcan, Norsk Hydro, Kaiser, MIM and
Quexco, have plants in Britain producing non-
ferrous metals. The aluminium industry, which
has raised its productivity and competitiveness
significantly in recent years, supplies customers
in the aerospace, transport, automotive and
construction industries. Other important non-
ferrous metal sectors are copper and copper
alloys, used for electrical wire, cables and
machinery, connectors, automotive
components, plumbing and building products,
and heat exchangers, boilers, tubing and
electrical gear; lead for lead acid batteries and
roofing; zinc for galvanising to protect steel;
nickel, used principally as an alloying element
to make stainless steel and high temperature
turbine alloys; and titanium for high-strength,
low-weight aerospace applications. Despite an
overall decline in the castings industry, some
foundries have invested in new melting,
moulding and quality control equipment.
Fabricated metal products include pressure
vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for
chemical and oil-refining plant; steam-raising
boilers; nuclear reactors; water and sewage
treatment plant; and steelwork for bridges,
buildings and industrial installations. Other
products include central heating radiators and
boilers, cutlery, tools and general hardware.
Machinery and Domestic Appliances
The highest concentration of employment in
these industries is to be found in the South
East (with 22% of total employment),
followed by the West Midlands (16%) and the
North West (11%). Mechanical machine-
building is an area in which British firms
excel, especially internal combustion engines,
power transmission equipment, pumps and
compressors, wheeled tractors, construction
and earth-moving equipment, and textile
machinery.
The UK is a major producer of industrial
engines, pumps, valves and compressors, and
of pneumatic and hydraulic equipment. The
Weir Group is one of the world’s biggest
producers of pumps. Companies such as
Mitsui-Babcock manufacture steam generators
and other heavy equipment for power plants.
Alstom is one of only a handful of firms in the
world which can supply the major components
for a complete power station project and the
transformers and switchgear needed in
transmission and distribution of electricity.
The company is undertaking a major contract
for eight hydraulic turbines for the first phase
of the Three Gorges Dam (the world’s biggest
hydro-electric project) in the People’s
Republic of China. The mechanical lifting and
handling equipment industry makes cranes
and transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and air
bridges, as well as electronically controlled
and automatic handling systems. The
commercial heating, ventilation, air-
conditioning and refrigeration sector is served
to a great extent by small and medium-sized
firms, although several large multinational
companies have sites in the UK.
The UK is a major producer of agricultural
tractors within Europe; they are manufactured
by a small number of companies, notably Agco
(Massey Ferguson), Case, New Holland and
JCB. Many tractors are fitted with computer-
controlled functions. A range of technically
advanced and innovative agricultural machines

are also made, which include specialist
pesticide sprayers and combined
mower/conditioners designed to reduce the
drying time for grass. Several manufacturers
specialise in machines for a variety of overseas
uses, including small-scale farms in the
tropics.
Most machine tools made in the UK are
purchased by engineering, aerospace,
automotive and metal goods industries both at
home and overseas (exports account for about
35% of turnover). Computer numerical-
controlled machines make up an increasing
proportion of output. Overseas-owned
manufacturers (mainly from the United
States) have a significant involvement in the
UK machine tool industry, in which half of
the top 20 companies are British; the 600
Group is the biggest British company.
The mining and tunnelling equipment
industry leads the world in the production of
coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports,
conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
JCB, Europe’s biggest construction equipment
manufacturer, is the world’s largest producer
of backhoe loaders and telescopic handlers,
and a major exporter. Most sales of textile
machinery are to export markets. British
innovations include computerised colour
matching and weave simulation, friction
spinning, high-speed computer-controlled
knitting machines and electronic jacquard
attachments for weaving looms. British
companies also make advanced printing
machinery and ceramic processing equipment,
and other types of production machinery.
The domestic appliance sector
manufactures ‘white’ goods (such as washing
machines, water and room heaters,
refrigerators and dishwashers), vacuum
cleaners, microwave ovens and other cooking
appliances. Domestic appliance manufacturers
employ some 35,000 people in about 80
companies. Household brand names include
Hotpoint, Creda, Lee and Candy/Hoover.
Among innovative products in the last few
years is the dual cyclone vacuum cleaner made
by Dyson, which is now the leading upright
vacuum cleaner manufacturer in the UK.
Electrical and Optical Equipment
Within this sector there has been considerable
variation in output trends. Production of
office machinery and computers has more
than doubled since 1990, while radio,
television and communications equipment
output is up by about 40%. Export sales in
both these industries are just over half of total

sales. However, output of medical and optical
instruments has changed little during the
1990s, while that of electrical machinery and
apparatus has fallen by about 9%.
The South East provides a substantial
proportion of employment (especially sales
and administrative jobs) in these sectors, with
Scotland and Wales having become important
areas for inward investors. Scotland’s
electronics industry (‘Silicon Glen’—in reality
all of central Scotland) directly employs about
50,000 people. In 1996 it accounted for
exports worth over £10,200 million, 55% of
Scotland’s manufactured exports.
Many of the world’s leading electronics
firms have manufacturing plants in the UK.
IBM, Sony, National Semiconductor,
Compaq, Panasonic, Samsung, Fujitsu,
Toshiba and Hewlett-Packard are among
major overseas-based multinationals with
substantial manufacturing investment in the
UK. Despite difficulties in the Korean
economy, LG is continuing with the
development of a wide-screen television
factory at Newport (south Wales). The main
electronic consumer goods produced are
television sets (one in three television sets
made in the EU comes from the UK). High-
fidelity audio and video equipment is also
produced. British-manufactured products
have a worldwide reputation as high-quality
goods aimed at the upper end of the market.
Semiconductors are used in all electronic
applications. The UK semiconductor market
is worth about £4,000 million a year. It now
ranks alongside that of Germany in Europe.
The computer industry in the UK is the
largest in Europe, producing an extensive
range of systems for all uses. For information
on software, see chapter 30, p. 530. The
multinational computer manufacturers in the
UK include IBM, Compaq, Sun and ICE.
Other companies, such as Psion (a pioneer of
the ‘palmtop’ computer), have concentrated
on developing new lines for specialised
markets.
A broad range of other electrical machinery
and apparatus is produced in the UK: power
plant, electric motors, generators,
transformers, switchgear, insulated wire and
cable, and lighting equipment. Rolls-Royce
Industrial Power Group produces highly
efficient aero-derivative gas turbines in smaller
applications. The UK is a world leader in the
manufacture of generating sets. In the cables
sector, BICC and Pirelli produce high-voltage
transmission cables and optical fibre cables for
telecommunications. TLG is the UK’s largest
manufacturer of lighting products.
Communications Equipment
The domestic telecommunications equipment
market is worth some £4,400 million a year.
Manufacturers have been investing heavily in
facilities to meet the rapidly increasing
demand for telecommunications services (see
chapter 22). The main products are switching
and transmission equipment, telephones and
terminals. Marconi Communications is the
UK’s foremost telecommunications
manufacturer. It is now wholly owned by the
British GEC group after its purchase in 1998
of the 40% stake of Siemens of Germany. Its
range includes PBXs (private branch
exchanges), payphones, transmission systems
and videoconferencing equipment. Marconi
Communications exports of £332 million in
1997 were 29% higher than in 1996. Other
prominent manufacturers in the UK include
Nortel and Alcatel. Transmission equipment
and cables for telecommunications and
information networks include submarine and
high-specification data-carrying cables.
There has been remarkable growth in
mobile communications (see p. 380), where
the UK has both the largest market and the
largest manufacturing base in Europe. The
main producers—Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson
and Lucent—all have UK production and
design centres. Fibre optics (invented in the
UK) enjoy equally rapid growth, as do
optoelectronic components, where Hewlett-
Packard, Nortel, BICC and Pirelli have
considerable UK facilities.
Another sector of the industry
manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar navigational
aids for ships and aircraft, thermal imaging
systems, alarms and signalling apparatus,
public broadcasting equipment and other
capital goods. Radar was invented in the UK
and British firms are still in the forefront of
technological advances. Racal Avionics’
480
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
X-band radar for aircraft ground movement
control is in use at airports in several overseas
countries. Solid-state secondary surveillance
radar, manufactured by Cossor Electronics, is
being supplied to numerous overseas civil
aviation operators.
Medical Electronics
The high demand for advanced medical
equipment in the UK stems from its
comprehensive healthcare system and
numerous clinical research and testing
facilities undertaking research in the chemical,
biological, physical and molecular sciences.
Important contributions have been made by
British scientists and engineers to basic R&D
in endoscopy, CT (computerised tomography)
scanning, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI—pioneered in the UK), ultrasonic
imaging, CADiagnosis and renal analysis.
Against this background, UK medical
electronic firms—in total more than 400,
employing about 7,000 people—continue their
tradition of developing and manufacturing a
large range of medical equipment for domestic
and overseas health sectors. Companies such
as GEC and Oxford Instruments produce,
among other things, ultrasound scanners,
electromyography systems and patient
monitoring systems for intensive and coronary
care and other uses. Other well-known
British-owned companies include BTR pic,
Smith and Nephew and Smiths Industries.
About two-fifths of the medium to large
companies have a US or other overseas parent.
Instrumentation and Control
A variety of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in the UK, as well as
analytical instruments, process control
equipment, and numerical control and
indication materials, all for use in machine
tools. The instrument engineering industry
makes measuring, photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic items;
watches, clocks and other timing devices; and
medical surgical instruments. This is a vibrant
part of UK industry, with annual exports of
about £3,000 million and a positive trade
balance of £674 million. Some 2,700
enterprises employ about 81,000 people.
Motor Vehicles
New car registrations increased by 7% in 1997
to 2.17 million, the third highest figure on
record. Car production, at 1.7 million, was at
its highest level since 1973. Output of motor
vehicles and components has risen by about
10% since 1990. Vehicle manufacturers are
increasingly pursuing a global market, with
production no longer dominated by their
traditional home markets. This is reflected in
the rise in both UK exports and imports of
motor vehicles. Exports (including
components) were valued at £19,200 million
in 1997, 3.1% higher than in 1996. A total of
962,000 passenger cars were exported in 1997,
well over twice as many as in 1990.
Around 790,000 jobs are dependent on the
UK automotive industry, including 330,000
engaged in vehicle and component production
and manufacturing activities. There are 22 car
and 13 commercial vehicle manufacturers. Car
output is dominated by seven overseas groups,
accounting for 99% of the total: Rover (a
subsidiary of BMW), Ford (including Jaguar),
Vauxhall, Peugeot-Talbot, Honda, Nissan
and Toyota. The remainder is in the hands
of smaller, specialist producers such as
Motor Vehicles—statistics for 1997 unless indicated

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Rolls-Royce (now owned by Volkswagen),
whose cars are renowned for their quality and
durability.
Capital investment continues on a large
scale, including nearly £2,600 million by Ford
between 1996 and 2000, £650 million by
General Motors in Vauxhall up to the year
2000 and about £600 million a year by Rover.
Since their arrival in the mid-1980s, Nissan,
Toyota and Honda have invested nearly
£4,000 million in the UK, which is their main
base for the European market. All three are
now producing at least two models of car in
the UK. A period of major change has
accompanied the arrival of the three Japanese
car manufacturers. Their management
approach, high productivity, quality,
workforce commitment and co-operative
partnerships have had a positive effect on
established car and component manufacturers
alike. In the last decade UK vehicle production
per person has increased by over 70%.
Rover’s model range includes the highly
successful Land Rover four-wheel drive
vehicles (which celebrated their 50th
anniversary in 1998) and a full range of family
cars. In 1998 Rolls-Royce began producing its
first totally new model for nearly 20 years—the
Silver Seraph—at its Crewe plant.
The main truck manufacturers are Leyland
Trucks and Volvo. Dennis, based in Guildford,
is also an important bus manufacturer. British-
based bus companies achieve considerable sales
in overseas markets. London Taxis
International has recently launched a new
version of the famous London taxi.
The automotive components
manufacturing sector, with an annual turnover
of £12,000 million and employing 150,000, is
a major contributor to the UK motor industry.
About 7,000 companies (some 90% of them
SMEs) are involved, many of which also
supply other sectors. Well-known British
companies such as GKN, Pilkington, Unipart,
Automotive Products, BTR, Johnson Matthey
and BBA have large automotive plants, as do
other multinationals such as LucasVarity,
Federal Mogul, Valeo, Bosch and Johnson
Controls.
Automotive components and raw materials
account for 70% of the cost of vehicle
manufacturers’ output. In recent years the
sector has enjoyed strong growth and rising
productivity. In 1997 the value of UK exports
rose by over 5%, while that of imports fell by
more than 15%.
Recent investments and announcements of
investment plans include Toyota laying out
£150 million at its engine plant in Deeside,
raising capacity to 400,000 engines a year; four
Unipart joint ventures totalling over £80
million; and Visteon spending £128 million on
four facilities in the UK.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
The UK merchant shipbuilding industry,
located mainly in Scotland and northern
England, consists of 12 yards producing ships
ranging from fishing vessels to large specialist
craft for offshore exploration and exploitation
work. At the end of March 1998 the industry’s
order-book was for 27 ships with a total
compensated gross tonnage (which indicates
shipyard output) of 356,100 and worth some
£200 million. The merchant ship repair and
conversion industry, strong for small to
medium-size craft, consists of 66 companies
employing between 4,000 and 7,000,
depending on activity levels, and a turnover of
some £300 million in 1997. The three warship
building and three refit and repair yards are
looking to extend their area of interest into the
merchant vessel sector. Together they employ
about 18,000 people.
In addition, about 400 firms are engaged in
the manufacture of pleasure and sporting
boats. A few internationally known builders
dominate the sector. The UK marine
equipment industry has a turnover of over
£800 million and employs about 9,500 people.
(Few companies, however, are totally
dedicated to marine equipment manufacture.)
It tends to concentrate around what used to be
the major shipping and shipbuilding centres in
London, Southampton, Liverpool, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Glasgow and Belfast, and
production includes sophisticated navigational
and propulsion systems. About two-thirds of
output is exported.
More than two decades of oil and gas
exploitation in the North Sea have generated a
major offshore industry (see p. 494).
Shipbuilders and fabricators build floating

MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
production storage and offload vessels
(FPSOs) and semi-submersible units for
drilling, production and emergency/
maintenance support; drill ships; jack-up rigs;
modules; and offshore loading systems.
Harland and Wolff of Belfast is a world leader
in the FPSO and drill ship fields. UIE
Scotland, Highlands Fabricators, John Brown
and McDermott Scotland are among the
larger contractors employed by the oil
operators for the design and manufacture of
jack-up oil rigs and semi-submersibles. Many
other firms supply equipment and services to
the offshore industry, notably diving
expertise, consultancy, design, project
management and R&D. A number have used
their experience of North Sea projects to
establish themselves in oil and gas markets
throughout the world.
Railway Equipment
Several companies based in the UK
manufacture locomotives, rolling stock and
signalling for domestic and overseas railway
operators. Output fell in the run-up to the
privatisation of the UK’s railways (see chapter
22), but is now recovering as a result of orders
placed by the train operators for new rolling
stock and of the large-scale investment
programme being undertaken by Railtrack in
track, signalling and other infrastructure. The
main manufacturers are Adtranz and Alstom.
British Steel Track Products is one of the
world’s leading manufacturers of steel rail.
Aerospace and Defence
The UK’s aerospace industry, the biggest in
Europe, is one of only three in the world with
a complete capability across the whole
spectrum of aerospace. Turnover in 1997 was
about £15,000 million, of which 75% was
exported, compared with £8,400 million in
1987. The industry contributed over £3,000
million to the UK’s balance of payments in
1997. Some 121,000 people are directly
employed in it. (The South East, South West
and North West provide the highest number
of jobs.) The biennial Farnborough Airshow,
organised by the Society of British Aerospace
Companies, is one of the world’s premier
airshows.
The leading companies are British
Aerospace (BAe), Rolls-Royce and Marconi
Electronic Systems of GEC, all of which are
among the UK’s top five exporters. BAe
produces both civil and military aircraft, as
well as aircraft components and guided
weapons, employing 44,000 people altogether.
At the end of 1997 its order-book was £22,100
million, of which £12,600 million represented
defence-related orders.
The industry’s activities cover designing
and constructing airframes, aero-engines,
guided weapons, simulators and space
satellites, materials, flight controls including
‘fly-by-wire’ and ‘fly-by-light’ equipment (see
p. 485), materials, avionics and complex
components, with their associated services. In
order to improve fuel economy, engine and
airframe manufacturers use lighter materials
such as titanium and carbon-fibre composites
(see p. 478), combined with advanced avionics
and improved aerodynamic techniques.
The UK is the second largest defence
supplier after the United States. Exports were
estimated at £5,500 million in 1997, and the
sector supports some 420,000 jobs, with
150,000 dependent on defence exports. An

development of civil and military aircraft and
engines, such as the four-nation Eurofighter
2000 programme (see pp. 102-3), is leading to
significant savings on the costs of long-term
programmes.
Civil Aircraft
BAe has a 20% share of the European
consortium Airbus Industrie, with
responsibility for designing and
manufacturing the wings for the whole family
of Airbus airliners, from the short- to
medium-haul A320 series (the first civil
airliner to use fly-by-wire controls—see
p. 485) to the large long-range four-engined
A340. Airbus and its related businesses
support 25,000 UK jobs in 300 companies and
contribute about £1,000 million a year to the
UK’s balance of payments. In 1997 Airbus
received firm orders for 460 new aircraft
worth a total of US $29,600 million from 48
customers around the world, and in the first
half of 1998 it had 52% of the world market
for large civil aircraft. Airbus is planning to
revise its structure, with the intention of
becoming a single corporate entity in 1999.
Short Brothers is owned by Bombardier
Inc. of Canada and employs about 9,000
people, mainly in Belfast. The company is
mostly engaged in design and production of
major civil aircraft sub-assemblies, advanced
engine nacelles and components for aerospace
manufacturers as well as the provision of
aviation support services.
Military Aircraft and Missiles
BAe is one of the world’s top defence
companies, with more than four-fifths of its
military production exported in 1997. Among
its military aircraft are the Harrier, a
vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL)
military combat aircraft, and the Tornado
combat aircraft, which is being built by a
company set up jointly by BAe, Alenia and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace. BAe also produces
the Hawk fast-jet trainer, being supplied to 17
customers worldwide. It is also involved with
Lockheed Martin of the United States in the
US Joint Strike Fighter programme.
BAe is a major supplier of tactical guided
weapon systems for use on land, at sea and in
the air, having merged its missile business
with that of France’s Matra Corporation to
form Europe’s largest guided weapons
concern. Shorts Missile Systems Ltd (SMS) is
a joint venture between Shorts and Thomson-
CSF of France in the area of very short-range
air defence systems.
Marconi Electronic Systems achieved sales
of £3,685 million in 1997-98, with 65%
representing sales to customers outside the
UK, and at the end of 1997-98 its order-book
was a record £9,300 million. The company is
prime contractor for the PHOENIX
unmanned aerial vehicle project.
Helicopters
GKN-Westland Helicopters manufactures the
Sea King, Lynx and Apache military
helicopters, and, in partnership with Agusta of
Italy, the multi-role EH101 medium-lift
helicopter at its Somerset facilities. Over 1,000
Westland helicopters are in service in 19
countries.
Land Systems
The UK’s main armoured fighting vehicle
capability is concentrated in three companies:
Vickers Defence Systems, GKN Defence and
Alvis. Royal Ordnance, owned by BAe, is the
UK’s only indigenous ordnance company and
also has three overseas sites.
Engines and Other Aviation Equipment
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three prime
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a
turnover in 1997 of £3,071 million for its
aerospace business. More than 53,000 Rolls-
Royce engines are in service, one of the largest
fleets in the world. Over 1,000 RB211-535
engines have been produced, and 80% of
Boeing 757 operators have selected it. The
company’s latest large engine, the Trent, has
achieved a significant share of the world
market for the new generation of wide-body
twin-engined airliners, such as Boeing’s 777
and the Airbus A330. Rolls-Royce is a partner
484
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
in the four-nation International Aero Engine
consortium, which manufactures the low-
emission V2500 aero-engine, now in service
on the Airbus A320 and A321. Rolls-Royce
produces military engines for both fixed-wing
aircraft and helicopters, and is a partner in the
EJ200 engine project for the Eurofighter and
in the US Joint Strike Fighter programme.
Manufacturers like Dowty, Marconi
Electronic Systems, Lucas, Smiths Industries,
Racal, Meggitt, Cobham, Hunting,
Normalair-Garrett and BAe provide
equipment and systems for engines, aircraft
propellers, navigation and landing systems,
engine and flight controls, environmental
controls and oxygen breathing and regulation
systems, electrical generation, mechanical and
hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings,
flight-deck controls and information displays.
Marconi Electronic Systems is the world’s
largest manufacturer of head-up displays
(HUDs). British firms have made important
technological advances, for example, in
developing fly-by-wire and fly-by-light
technology, where control surfaces on the
wings and elsewhere are moved by means of
automatic electronic signalling and fibre optics
respectively. UK companies provide radar and
air traffic control equipment and ground
power supplies to airports and airlines
worldwide (see also p. 480).
Space Equipment and Services
Over 400 companies employing more than
6,500 people are engaged in industrial space
activities (see pp. 422-3), with annual turnover
now more than £740 million. Through its
participation in the European Space Agency,
the British National Space Centre (see p. 422)
has enabled UK-based companies to participate
in many leading space projects covering
telecommunications, satellite navigation, Earth
observation, space science and astronomy. The
industry is strong in the development and
manufacture of civil and military
communications satellites and associated Earth
stations and ground infrastructure equipment.
In the field of Earth observation, it plays a major
role in manufacturing platforms, space radar
and meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
The largest British space company is Matra
Marconi Space UK. Together with its French
partner, it is one of the world’s major space
companies. It has become the leading provider
of direct broadcast television satellites, and is
involved in nearly all of Europe’s space
science projects.
Other firms, such as EEV, Sira, Pilkington,
Com Dev, ERA and AEA Technology, supply
satellite subsystems, and IGG is Europe’s
leading procurer and tester of space qualified
components. UK companies such as Surrey
Satellite Technology and Space Innovations
are leaders in the field of micro and mini
satellites, which provide relatively quick and
cheap access to space. Major suppliers of
satellite ground stations include EOS, Logica,
Science Systems and Vega.
Construction
Output of the construction industry in Great
Britain in 1997 was valued at £58,352 million.
This represented a 2% rise in volume on 1996,
but was still 7% below the 1990 figure. The
main sectors of the industry are represented
by:
• building and civil engineering
contractors—ranging from major private
sector companies with diverse
international interests to one-person
enterprises carrying out domestic repairs;
• specialist sub-contractors—undertaking
construction work ranging from
structural steelwork and precast concrete
structures to mechanical and electrical
services (including the design and
installation of environmentally friendly
building control systems);
• building material and component
suppliers—ranging from large quarrying
companies, through those engaged in
mass production of manufactured items,
to small, highly specialised
manufacturers; and
• consultants—engaged in the planning,
design and supervision of construction
projects.
Some 1.4 million people were employed in
construction in 1997. Although less than 100
485
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
building companies out of roughly 200,000
employ more than 600 people directly, these
undertake about 15% of all construction in the
UK. Some larger firms own quarries and
factories for materials manufacture, and
sophisticated plant. Several undertake
responsibility for all stages of projects from
initial design to final construction.
Project Procurement, Management and
Financing
Private and public sector projects are managed
in a variety of ways. Most clients invite
construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
Alternative methods of project procurement
have become more common in recent years
—for example, contracts might include
subsequent provision of building maintenance,
or a comprehensive ‘design-and-build’ service
where a single company oversees every stage
of a project from conception to completion.
Financing of major projects has also been
changing. Traditionally, clients raised the
finance to pay for schemes themselves. Today,
they often demand a complete service package
which includes finance; as a result, larger
construction companies are developing closer
links with banks and other financial
institutions. In public sector construction
the Government’s Private Finance
Initiative/Public-Private Partnerships (see
p. 392) have also heralded a move away from
traditional financing. Under the initiative,
following competitive bidding, private sector
companies erect large-scale public
infrastructure projects, including transport,
health, education and prison building
schemes.
Major Construction Projects in the UK
Major building schemes in hand or recently
completed include the express transport link
from central London to Heathrow Airport; the
London Underground Jubilee Line extension
connecting the centre of the capital with the
new commercial and residential areas in
London’s Docklands; the M74 motorway in
Scotland; and the Millennium Dome project
(see p. 355), designed to celebrate the advent
of the 21st century, on a peninsular site in the
London Borough of Greenwich. Gatwick,
Stansted and Manchester airports have been
substantially redeveloped. There has also been
large-scale redevelopment of sports stadiums,
including Twickenham (near London) and
Murrayfield (Edinburgh) rugby grounds, and
the rugby stadium at Cardiff Arms Park is
being rebuilt. Several football clubs have built
new stadiums, including Huddersfield,
Middlesbrough, Bolton, Reading and
Sunderland.
The Channel Tunnel (see p. 369), which
opened to traffic in 1994, remains the largest
single civil engineering project ever
undertaken in Europe. It is nearly 50 km (31
miles) long and 70 m (230 ft) below sea level at
its deepest. Associated projects included new
international stations at Waterloo in London
and Ashford (Kent), and an international
terminal at Folkestone.
Housing
During 1997 construction of some 199,900
dwellings was started in the UK. Starts by
private sector concerns were 171,500, by
housing associations 27,400, and in the public
sector 1,100. Around 188,400 dwellings were
completed: 159,100 by the private sector,
28,000 by housing associations and 1,400 by
the public sector. The total value of new
housing orders was £7,428 million (see
chapter 21).
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
UK companies are engaged in major
undertakings throughout the world and have
been in the forefront of management
contracting and of ‘design and build’

The UK is self-sufficient in energy in net terms. In 1997 the energy industries
accounted for 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 7% of total investment.
Energy production directly employs 175,000 people—4% of industrial
employment. In 1997 it produced a trade surplus in fuels of £3,837 million.
In 1997 energy production was fractionally up on 1996 and consumption 2.6%
lower: oil production was down 1.4%, but gas output rose by 2.2%, to a record
high. The gas supply market in Great Britain is now open to competition and
the final phase of electricity market liberalisation is due for completion in 1999.
The UK has what has been termed the world's biggest competitive gas market
and (after Canada) the second lowest gas prices in the world. The Government
has published its proposals to remove distortions and overhaul trading
arrangements in Great Britain's electricity market.
Energy Resources
The UK has large reserves of fossil fuels and a
more varied and balanced energy supply than
many other countries. It is far less dependent
on imports than its EU partners, and was one
of only five OECD countries which produced
more energy than it consumed in 1996.1 The
mix of primary fuels (oil, gas, nuclear power
and coal) consumed in the UK has become
increasingly diverse, mainly as a result of a
1 The others were Norway (exceptional in producing almost
nine times as much energy as it consumes), Australia,
Mexico and Canada.
decline in coal use and the growing use of gas.
Coal still supplied a significant proportion of
the country’s primary energy needs: 38% of
electricity production by all generators in
1997, while nuclear power provided 31% and
oil and gas 30%.
In the early 1970s, energy imports
accounted for over 50% of the UK’s primary
energy consumption, as recently discovered oil
and gas reserves were still being developed. By
1981, the UK had become a net exporter of
energy, as oil and gas production came on
stream. After the Piper Alpha accident in the
North Sea in 1988, oil production fell, so that
in 1991-92 the UK was a net importer of
488
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
crude oil for the first time since 1980. UK oil
production has since improved to record levels
in 1996, and in 1997 it exported 77 million
tonnes of crude oil out of total exports of 109
million tonnes of oil equivalent of all energy
products. It imported 78 million tonnes (of all
energy products), generating an energy trade
surplus of £3,837 million, some £400 million
less than in 1996. Energy represents 5.7% of
UK exports and 3.2% of imports of goods.
ENERGY POLICY
The Government’s energy policy is to ensure
secure, diverse and sustainable supplies at
competitive prices, with competition between
suppliers in open markets. It has also
committed itself to reducing the adverse
effects of energy production on the
environment and to ensuring that coal can
compete on equal terms with other energy
sources. In 1997-98 the Government
conducted various reviews, whose outcomes
will have a major effect on the operation of a
liberalised electricity market:
• on reform of regulation of the privatised
utilities (see p. 499);
• on wholesale trading arrangements in the
electricity market (see p. 497); and
• on energy sources for power stations,
including the role of coal (see p. 497).
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) has also carried out a review of its
support for clean coal technology and
renewable energy.
The independent regulators (see pp. 496
and 498) have a duty to encourage the
development of competition in the gas and
electricity markets, and protect the interests of
consumers, by administering price controls
and enforcing standards of service in
remaining areas of monopoly, such as in the
transmission/distribution networks—the
pipes and wires. The Government’s views on
reform of utility regulation, published in July
1998, included proposals to amalgamate the
regulation of gas and electricity (to reflect the
growing convergence of these markets), with a
single energy regulator; to impose a new
primary duty on the regulator to protect the
Ministers insist that deregulated energy
markets must not unfairly hit the most
needy: low-income households can spend
an average 10% of earnings a week on
energy; middle-income households about
4%. In 1996-97 about 17.5% of
households bought power (electricity or
gas) from prepayment meters; they are
charged on average £20 a year more for
their metering than customers who pay on
account, rising to £40 for gas when
comparing prepayment to direct debit.
The electricity companies have submitted
a plan to collect up to £100 million (£4 a
year levy on households) to fund a scheme
to aid disadvantaged electricity users.
interests of consumers; and to separate the
distribution and supply functions in
electricity.
The Government’s proposals for fuels for
electricity generation and for reform of the
electricity Pool (see p. 497) were published in
October 1998.
International Developments
The EU imports about 50% of its energy
needs. In the European Commission’s (EC)
view, this figure, if current trends continue
and no preventive steps are taken, could, by
2020, reach 80% for coal, 70% for natural gas
and 90% for oil. Recent EU measures have
therefore stressed a security of supply strategy
based on:
• diversification of sources;
• promotion of renewable energy
indigenous to the EU;
• rational use of energy;
• greater international co-operation and
development of trans-European energy
networks connecting the EU to external
supplies; and
• reduction of energy costs higher than
those borne by non-European
counterparts; for example, in the
chemical sector, EU companies can pay
up to 45% more for their energy than
those in the United States.

EU research and development (R&D) and
demonstration of energy technologies is
carried out within the Fourth Framework
Programme, to continue under the Fifth
Framework Programme, which starts in 1999
and will focus on: security and diversity of
supply; provision of high-quality, low-cost
energy services; improved industrial
competitiveness; and reduced environmental
impact. The SYNERGY programme, adopted
in 1997, aims to increase energy investment
and exports by EU undertakings in and to
third countries; to ease interconnection of the
energy networks in third countries and
between them and Europe; and to prepare east
European associated countries for accession by
bringing their energy policies closer to that of
the EU.
The EU undertakes international technical
assistance programmes and co-financing in the
energy sector; for example, the ALURE
programme, in co-operation with the
countries of Latin America. The EU also
collaborates with specialist international
organisations, such as the International
Energy Agency (IEA), in particular for crisis
measures, such as the obligation on member
states to maintain a minimum crude-oil and
petroleum product stock against times of
shortage. Most member states (including the
UK) ratified the Energy Charter treaty in
December 1997, to promote long-term energy
investment and trade with the Russian
Federation, the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the Baltic States, Central
and Eastern Europe and most OECD
countries.
In February 1999 and in accordance with
the EC Internal Market in Electricity
Directive, 12 EU members are due to open at
least 25% of their electricity supply markets to
competition, rising to at least 33% by 2003.
The UK is expected to be at 100% in 1999
and Finland, Germany and Sweden are also
committed to opening 100%. Although some
countries are already ahead of these targets, in
others which are not, these measures will
initially benefit only large industrial and
commercial companies; it will be some years
before domestic consumers will be able to
choose a new supplier. The Directive also
permits governments to ring-fence 15% of
power markets for a single fuel to guarantee
future security of supply. In August 2000 EU
member states are due to open at least 20% of
their gas supply markets, rising to 28% by
2003 and 33% by 2008. Again, the UK is close
to 100%.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
In 1997 consumption of primary fuels in the
UK was only 6.8% higher than in 1970,
despite a 76% increase in GDP (at factor cost
490
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
in 1990 prices). Energy consumption by final
users in 1997 amounted to 158 million tonnes
of oil equivalent2 on an ‘energy supplied’ basis,
of which transport took 34%, industrial users
24%, residential users 28%, and commerce,
agriculture and public services 14%.
Primary energy consumption was 2.6%
lower than in 1996, mainly because of warmer
weather. Coal use was down by 10.5% and oil
by 3 .3%; but gas was up by 0.7%. On a
temperature corrected basis—which shows
what the annual intake might have been if the
average temperature during the year had been
the same as the average for 1961-90—gas
consumption increased by about 7%. Final
energy consumption (including petroleum
products and secondary electricity, for
example) decreased, by 2.6% over 1996:
residential consumption was down 6.7%;
industrial down 3.3%; services down 1.7%;
and transport up 1.5%.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The Government is committed to promoting
the more efficient use of energy. Energy
efficiency is in tune with its policy on
sustainable development and can offer major
benefits to householders and businesses, and
help to protect the environment by lessening
the threat of climate change (see chapter 20).
Improved energy efficiency reduces fuel bills
and maintenance costs. Recent estimates
suggest that it could cut UK carbon dioxide
(C02) emissions by about 20%. In its
programme to encourage energy efficiency the
Government provides information and advice,
and financial incentives.
The Energy Efficiency Best Practice
Programme stimulates improvements in
buildings, industry and transport. It aims at
savings worth £800 million a year by 2000,
and is currently saving about £500 million.
The Government funds the ‘Energy
Efficiency’ programme of the Energy Saving
Trust (EST), developed with the EST’s
partners in the energy efficiency industry.
The EST’s 50 Energy Efficiency Advice
Centres provide free, impartial help to their
customers in the domestic and small business
sectors, bringing them an average saving of
£57 a year. By the end of 1998, some 250,000
customers will have benefited.
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme
(HEES), revised in 1998, and with a budget of
£75 million in 1998-99, gives insulation
grants for householders receiving income-
related benefits and disability allowance, or
who are over 60. The EST runs schemes
offering financial incentives to promote, for
example, central heating controls, condensing
boilers, cavity wall insulation, high frequency
lighting and small-scale Combined Heat and
Power (CHP; see p. 499).
The Government’s Market Transformation
Strategy, launched in 1997, encourages the
marketing of domestic equipment which does
less harm to the environment, particularly by
using less energy. It seeks to cut back on 2
million tonnes of C02 by 2010. Energy labels
are mandatory for fridges, washing machines,
washer/dryers and tumble dryers. Regulations
for dishwashers and light bulbs are due in late
1998.
The Home Energy Conservation Act 1995
requires local authorities to prepare energy
conservation reports, identifying measures to
improve energy efficiency significantly in all
residential accommodation. The Act could
deliver a 30% improvement in England in
about 12 years, if all measures are
implemented.
New developments include:
• VAT reduced from 17.5% to 5% on
energy-saving materials under
government-funded grant schemes for
the less well-off;
• an extra £150 million for the HEES
budget over the next three years;
• support for the EST increased from £19
million in 1998-99 to £22 million in
1999-2000 and to £25 million for each of
the next two years;
• an extra £1.5 million for the Best
Practice programme in 1999-2000; and
• substantial resources for regeneration and
renovation of housing.

OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND
PRODUCTION
For centuries small quantities of oil have
been produced in mainland Britain, though
by the early 1960s this amounted to only
150,000 tonnes a year, about 0.3% of refinery
output. The UK was almost wholly
dependent for its oil supplies on imports.
The first notable offshore discovery of oil
(Arbroath field) in the United Kingdom
Continental Shelf (UKCS) was made in 1969
and the first oil brought ashore, from the
Argyll field, in 1975. In 1997, output of
crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) in
the UK averaged 2.7 million barrels (about
351,250 tonnes) a day, making it the world’s
ninth largest producer.
Structure of the Industry
The Government grants licences to private
sector companies to explore for and exploit oil
and gas resources (see below). Its main
sources of revenue from oil and gas activities
are Petroleum Revenue Tax (see p. 393),
levied on profits from fields approved before
16 March 1993; Corporation Tax, charged on
the profits of oil and gas companies—the only
tax on profits from fields approved after 15
March 1993; and royalty, which applies only
to fields approved before April 1982 and is
paid at 12.5% of the value of petroleum ‘won
and saved’.
Licensing
The 18th seaward licensing round since 1964,
for which bids had to be submitted by
September 1998, invited applications for
unlicensed acreage in the mature areas of the
northern, central and southern North Sea and
in the eastern Irish Sea—with the exception of
certain blocks excluded to protect the
environment (see p. 493) and the interests of
other sea users. By the end of 1997, 6,574
wells had been, or were being, drilled in the
UKCS: 2,011 exploration wells, 1,206
appraisal wells and 3,357 development wells.
The Government must approve all proposed
wells and development plans.
Production and Reserves
A record 189 offshore fields were in
production at the end of 1997, 98 oil, 75 gas
and 13 condensate (a lighter form of oil).
Production started at 21 new offshore oilfields
during 1997, and a total of 19 new
development projects were approved.
Offshore, these comprised 8 oilfields, 6
gasfields and 3 condensate; onshore, 1 gas and
1 oil. In addition, approval for 9 incremental
offshore developments (elaborations to
existing fields) and one onshore was granted.
Cumulative UKCS stabilised crude oil
production to end 1997 is 2,078 million
tonnes. The fields with the largest production
totals are Forties, Brent, Ninian and Piper.

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Britain’s largest onshore oilfield, at Wytch
Farm (Dorset), produces 83.5% of the total
crude oils and NGLs originating onshore.
Remaining recoverable reserves of oil in the
‘proven’ plus ‘probable’ categories amount to
1,390 million tonnes, while maximum
‘possible’ remaining reserves could be 2,015
million tonnes.
Offshore Gas
Initial offshore exploration concentrated on
finding gas in the Southern Basin of the North
Sea. After the first commercial natural gas
discovery in the West Sole field in 1965 and
the start of its exploitation in 1967, supplies of
offshore natural gas grew rapidly, and by 1977
natural gas had replaced town gas in the public
supply system in Great Britain. Natural gas
now accounts for about 36% of total inland
primary fuel consumption in the UK. In 1997
indigenous production amounted to a record
91,778 million cubic metres.
Production from the three most prolific
offshore gasfields, Leman, Indefatigable and
the Hewett area, has accounted for 40% of
the total gas produced so far in the UKCS.
Associated gas,3 delivered by pipeline to land
via the Far North Liquids and Associated Gas
System (FLAGS) and from the Scottish Area
Gas Evacuation System (SAGE), makes
additional contributions. The Southern Basin
fields and the South Morecambe field in the
Irish Sea produce more gas in winter to
satisfy increased demand, with the North
Sean and South Sean fields also augmenting
supplies to meet peak demand on very cold
days in winter. The partially depleted Rough
field is used as a gas store for rapid recovery
during peak winter periods (see map opposite
p. 518).
Cumulative gas production to end-1997 is 1.3
million million cubic metres. Remaining
recoverable gas reserves already discovered are
estimated at between 765,000 million and 1.4
million million cubic metres. If possible gas from
existing discoveries and potential future
discoveries are added, the remaining total
reserves are estimated to be in the range of 1.4
million million to 4 million million cubic metres.
Pipelines
Some 8,705 km (5,440 miles) of major submarine
pipelines transport oil, gas and condensate from
one field to another and to shore.
Five terminals on the North Sea coast bring
gas ashore to supply a national and regional
high- and low-pressure pipeline system some
267,300 km (167,060 miles) long, which
transports natural gas around Great Britain.
The pipeline taking natural gas from Scotland
to Northern Ireland (40.4 km; 25 miles)
carried its first gas in 1996; exports to the Irish
Republic are conveyed by the Britain-Ireland
interconnector. The pipeline (232 km; 145
miles) from Bacton to Zeebrugge in Belgium
opened in 1998 to provide a link between the
UK and EU gas grids.
Economic and Industrial Aspects
In 1997 UKCS oil and gas production
accounted for just over 2% of the UK’s GDP.
Total revenues from the sale of oil (including
NGLs) and gas produced from the UKCS in
1997 are estimated at £11,000 million and
£5,250 million respectively. Taxes and royalty
receipts attributable to UKCS oil and gas came
to about £3,500 million in 1997-98.
Gross capital investment from British
sources in the oil and gas extraction industry
remained steady at £4,400 million in 1997.
This represented about 16% of total British
industrial investment and nearly 4% of gross
domestic capital investment. Some 23,000
people were employed offshore by the industry
in September 1997, of whom 92% were British
nationals. A recent study estimates that the oil
and gas extraction industry supports
employment for about 382,000 people, of
whom 126,000 are in Scotland—-6.6% of total
Scottish employment.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Since 1965, the oil and gas production
industry has generated trading profits of
some £203,000 million, of which over
£73,000 million has been reinvested in the
industry, £86,000 million paid in taxation,
and £44,000 million left for disposal by the
companies. Total income of the oil and gas
sector fell from £21,000 million in 1996 to
some £19,000 million in 1997. Proceeds
from the sale of oil in 1997 were down
15% on 1996; those from the sale of gas
were down by just under 1%. Total value
of oil and gas produced onshore was about
£470 million in 1997, compared with £490
million in 1996. The main rate of
corporation tax, at 31% (30% from April
1999) is currently one of the lowest
company tax rates in the world and
underlines the UK’s attraction for foreign
oil investment.
its activity can cause damage. The introduction
of Environmental Assessment regulations in
1998 aims further to protect the offshore
environment and allow the public greater access
to information. During 1997 over 300 hours of
unannounced aerial surveillance of oil and gas
rigs detected minimal amounts of oil, and new
regulations will call for mandatory oil spill
contingency plans for all offshore installations.
Between April 1997 and March 1998, 62
offshore environmental inspections were
carried out. Three large spills, totalling 750
tonnes, were responsible for virtually all the oil
spilled in 1997.
The Petroleum Act 1987 provides for the
decommissioning of redundant offshore oil and
gas installations and pipelines on the UKCS.
Owners have to submit proposals to the
Government for approval. The European
Commission has called for all except a limited
number of installations in European waters to be
safely and economically removed from the sea
when they fall into disuse, with possible
exceptions for large concrete platforms, for
whose removal there is no known technology.
There are 64 installations in British waters that
become redundant in 2010-20, sit in more than
75 metres of water and weigh more than 4,000
tonnes.
Shell has announced that it is to dismantle
the Brent Spar storage and loading buoy
and use the pieces to build a ferry quay at
Mekjarvik in Norway. The total
decommissioning operation will cost
about £46 million.
Offshore Safety
Offshore health and safety are the
responsibility of the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE; see p. 164). Its report on the
1,097 hydrocarbon releases in the period
1992-97 (57% of which were of gas) classified
14% as of major severity, 53% as significant
and 33% as minor.
Suppliers of Goods and Services
The Infrastructure and Energy Projects
Directorate within the DTI is responsible for
helping UK-based contractors and suppliers
to win an increasing share of the provision of
goods and services to the oil, gas and
petrochemicals industry—a worldwide market
estimated to be worth £200,000 million a year.
The competitiveness of UK engineering
designers, fabricators and local supply chains
has enabled them to win a share in providing
an average 70% of the goods and services
needed for recent development projects on the
UKCS. They have also won business in
Norway, Canada and other overseas markets.
The Elgin/Franklin, Shearwater and Triton
projects represent the lion’s share of current
capital investment by operators on the UKCS
(see above). UK companies have benefited
from the increase in worldwide demand for

addition to major upgrades to semi-

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
DOWNSTREAM OIL
Oil Consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1997 included 22.3 million
tonnes of petrol for motors, 15 million tonnes
of DERV (diesel-engined road vehicles) fuel,
8.4 million tonnes of aviation turbine fuel, 7.3
million tonnes of gas oil (distilled from
petroleum) and 3.8 million tonnes of fuel oils
(blends of heavy petroleum).
Oil Refineries
In 1997 the UK’s 14 refineries processed 97
million tonnes of crude and process oils.
About 80% of output by weight is in the form
of lighter, higher-value products, such as
gasoline, DERV and jet kerosene. The UK is
much more geared towards petrol production
than its European counterparts—about a third
of each barrel of crude, compared with a
European average of just over a fifth.
Trade
In 1997, the UK exported 26.7 million tonnes
of refined petroleum products, worth £2,662
million. Virtually all exports went to its
partners in the EU and the IEA, the largest
markets being France and Germany, and the
United States.
Some 1,993 million cubic metres of UKCS
gas were exported. About half went to the
Netherlands, from the British share of the
Markham transboundary field and
neighbouring Windermere, and about half was
taken by the Irish Republic. About 1,300
million cubic metres were imported from
Norway. Norwegian imports were 1.5% of
total supplies in 1997, compared with 2.1%
in 1996.
GAS SUPPLY INDUSTRY
Structure of the Industry
The Gas Act 1995, which set the framework
for a fully competitive gas market, does not
allow a holder of a public gas transporter’s
licence to hold licences for supply or
shipping.4 In 1997, British Gas, the former
monopoly supplier to customers taking less
than 2,500 therms a year, demerged into two
entirely separate companies. The supply
business is now part of the holding company
Centrica pic (which still trades under the
British Gas brand name in the UK), while the
pipeline and storage businesses, most
exploration and production, and R&D have
been retained within British Gas pic, renamed
BG pic.
The national and regional gas pipeline
network is owned by Transco, part of BG pic,
which retains responsibility for dealing with
leaks and emergencies, and also has a current
monopoly in gas metering. Ofgas (see p. 496)
plans a framework for competition in
metering, to stimulate the introduction of
high-tech meters that could handle both gas
and electricity. A Network Code sets the legal
and contractual framework for the rights and
responsibilities of Transco and users of its
transportation and storage network.
Competition
During 1994—97 some 70 independent
suppliers captured about 70% of the overall
industrial and commercial gas market. Gas
competition in the domestic market has
progressed on a regional basis; in May 1998 it
fully opened up throughout Great Britain and
all domestic customers are now able to choose
their supplier, with 20 other companies
competing with British Gas Trading
(Centrica’s supply business). By July 1998
some 13% of the domestic market had
switched from Centrica, still the country’s
largest supplier, to independents.
Only companies which have been granted a
supplier’s licence are allowed to sell gas. The
licence carries various conditions, which
include providing gas to anyone in the licence
area who requests it and is connected to the
mains gas supply. Suppliers must offer
4 Suppliers sell piped gas to consumers; public gas
transporters (PGTs) operate the pipeline system through
which gas will normally be delivered; shippers arrange with
PGTs for appropriate amounts of gas to go through the
pipeline system.
495
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Among the other companies selling gas are
ScottishPower, Hyder, United Utilities
and Eastern Electricity, as well as oil and
gas companies such as Amerada, Texaco
and Color Gas. ScottishPower owns
Man web, the Cheshire and north Wales
electricity supplier, and Southern Water;
United Utilities is the result of the merger
of Norweb, the north-west England
electricity company, and North West
Water; Hyder was created when Swalec
(the south Wales electricity company) and
Welsh Water joined forces. Customers can
expect to benefit from affinity deals,
whereby suppliers seek to reduce costs by
selling on the back of another product.
Eastern Electricity, part of Energy Group
and now the second largest seller of gas to
the domestic market, has announced a tie-
up with Barclaycard; cardholders are
eligible for discounts.
customers a range of payment options; they
are able to set their own charges, but have to
publish their prices and other terms so that
customers can make an informed choice.
The Director General of Gas Supply, who
heads Ofgas, the industry regulator, has
powers to set price controls for British Gas
Trading and Transco, to set and enforce
standards of performance, and to oversee the
development of competition.
Consumption
Natural gas consumption, at an estimated 955
terawatt5 hours (TWh) in 1997, was up 1.8%
on 1996, with gas supplied for electricity
generation (amounting to 243 TWh) up 28%.
Sales to industry (187 TWh) were 2.4%
down; to the commercial sector (117 TWh)
2.5% down. Domestic sales (346 TWh) were
8.1% down. There has been a steady fall in
gas prices since 1982. In 1997 industrial gas
prices were the lowest among the EU
countries. Between 1987 and 1997 average
51 TW = 1,000 gigawatts (GW). 1 GW = 1,000 megawatts
(MW). 1 MW = 1,000 kilowatts (kW).
industrial gas prices fell by 58% in real terms;
domestic prices were reduced by 18%
(including VAT). In Great Britain a typical
household’s annual gas bill fell in real terms
from £375 in 1987 to £310 in 1997.
COAL
The main deep-mine operators in the UK’s
privatised coal industry are RJB Mining pic
(in England and Wales); Mining (Scotland)
Ltd; and Tower (a pit at Hirwaun in
Rhondda, Cynon and Taff, sold to a ‘buy-out’
team of former employees). RJB Mining and
Celtic Energy, together with the Scottish Coal
Company Ltd, are the main opencast
operators. In early spring 1998 there were 53
deep mines in production (including 20 major
pits, formerly nationalised, employing some
11,200 workers) and 79 opencast sites,
employing about 4,500. Opencast accounts for
most of the relatively low sulphur coal mined
in Scotland and south Wales, which
contributes towards improving the quality
and cost of English coal supplies. The
Government has detailed tighter controls
on opencast mining, which harms the
environment, alters the landscape and
affects the water table.
Market for Coal
The UK produces the lowest-cost deep-mined
coal in the EU. In 1997 inland consumption of
coal was 11% down on the 1996 figure, at 64
million tonnes, of which 74% was used by the
electricity generators, 14% by coke ovens,
1.4% by other fuel producers, 5.1% by
industry and 4.1% by domestic consumers.
Exports were 1 million tonnes, while imports
amounted to 20 million tonnes—mainly of
steam coal for electricity generation and
coking coal. Total production from British
deep mines fell from 32 million tonnes in 1996
to 30 million tonnes in 1997. Opencast output
went up 2% to nearly 17 million tonnes.
In 1998 the five-year contracts struck in
1993 before privatisation between British Coal
and the three principal coal-fired generators
ended. New contracts of up to five years were
concluded in 1997-98 between UK generators
and producers at world market-related prices,
496
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
but in lower quantities than the previous five-
year agreements. The Government’s review of
electricity generation (see below) has been
against a background of concern about trends
in fuel use for power generation and claims
that the electricity market has been rigged
against coal. Discussions are continuing
between generators and coal suppliers about
the former’s needs over the next few years in
the light of government policy on power
station fuelling.
The Government’s view is that where the
generators get their coal, how much and at
what price, is a matter for them. It does not
propose to subsidise any part of the industry,
nor to reserve any part of the power market
for coal. Its aim is to give an equal chance to
all fuels, so that coal producers can fairly
compete in an open and transparent coal
market.
Clean Coal
Some 80% of the DTFs clean coal R&D
programme is borne by industry and other
funding agencies; the DTI contribution for
1998-99 is £3.1 million. The programme aims
to improve the environmental performance of
power stations and to promote clean coal as a
key technology in the world market.
The Coal Authority
The Coal Authority licenses coal-mining;
holds, manages and disposes of interests in
unworked coal and mines; provides
information about mining plans and geological
data; and deals with subsidence damage claims
and pollution to groundwater arising from
former coal-mining.
ELECTRICITY
England and Wales
In December 1997, 46 companies held
generation licences in England and Wales, of
which the principal ones are National Power,
PowerGen, Eastern Group, British Energy,
and the publicly owned Magnox Electric.
They sell electricity to suppliers through a
marketing mechanism known as the ‘Pool’.
The National Grid (NGC) owns and operates
the transmission system, and is responsible for
calling up generation plant to meet demand.
Distribution—transfer of electricity from
the national grid to consumers via local
networks—is carried out by the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs) in England and
Wales. Supply—the purchase of electricity
from generators and its sale to consumers—is
largely open to competition; by June 1999 all
consumers are to be able to choose from whom
they can buy electricity.
As at October 1998, United States
companies owned 7 out of the 12 English and
Welsh RECs. British electricity companies
continue to invest overseas. National Power, for
example, has grown into one of the three largest
international electricity generators, with recent
investments taking the company’s spending
abroad to £1,300 million in five years.
Reform of Electricity Trading
The Review, at the Government’s invitation,
by the Director General of Electricity Supply
(DGES) of electricity trading arrangements,
including the Pool, was published in July
1998. It was prompted by criticisms of the
current arrangements: lack of price
transparency, no customer involvement in
price setting, and market distortions. The
DGES’s proposals are for a new set of trading
arrangements which do not feature a
compulsory Pool. Instead, there will be a
number of new markets which will allow more
opportunities for contracting, easier
adjustment of contracts, and better risk
management, balancing and operation of the
system. The arrangements are:
• a forward market, in which customers
and suppliers can contract bilaterally for
electricity, with contracts for actual
delivery of electricity;
• associated derivatives markets such as
futures and options;
• a short-term bilateral market which
would provide for simple screen-based
trading between generators, suppliers
and large customers, and would operate
probably from a day ahead and close four
hours ahead;
497
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• a balancing market, in which the NGC
would be the sole counterparty to trades,
which would operate from the point
where the short-term bilateral market
closes, and in which generators and
suppliers would be able to offer increases
and decreases from their contracted
position;
• a settlements process to cash out trades;
and
• developing other markets if market
participants require them.
These proposals are similar to those in other
competitive commodity and energy markets
and, in the Government’s view, are the right
way to proceed.
Scotland
ScottishPower pic and Scottish Hydro-
Electric pic generate, transmit, distribute and
supply electricity within their respective
franchise areas. They are also contracted to
buy all the output from Scottish Nuclear Ltd,
part of British Energy pic, until 2005. Scottish
Electricity Settlements Ltd has worked with
the England and Wales Pool to prepare a
framework for competition. On the eve of full
competition the over-100-kWh market in
Scotland comprised about 6,500 customers
and accounted for about 40% of all electricity
consumed. ScottishPower and Scottish
Hydro-Electric have second-tier licences
which allow them to compete in each other’s
area. Many customers choose to buy their
electricity from the competing Scottish public
electricity supplier. In 1997-98, 15.4% of
customers in the over-100-kWh market were
supplied by holders of second-tier supply
licences.
Northern Ireland
Three private companies, Nigen, Premier
Power and Coolkeeragh Power, generate
electricity from four power stations. They are
obliged to sell to Northern Ireland Electricity
(NIE), which has a monopoly of transmission
and distribution, and a right to supply. Supply
to all customers is open to competition, but
the small scale and relative isolation of the
system have prevented the introduction of
competitive energy trading. Implementation
of the EU Electricity Directive from February
1999 will provide the largest consumers (some
25% of the total market) with the opportunity
to contract directly with independent power
producers. Consumers pay an average 20%
more for electricity than their counterparts in
Great Britain.
The largest power station, Ballylumford,
was converted from oil to gas firing in 1996 and
accounts for almost half Northern Ireland’s
generating capacity (2,243 MW). The Province
has a power surplus, with a peak demand of
1,500 MWh. The Director General of
Electricity Supply for Northern Ireland
combines his electricity responsibilities with
those of the legally separate office of Director
General of Gas for Northern Ireland. He heads
a combined regulatory office, OFREG (Office
for the Regulation of Electricity and Gas).
Competition
The final phase of opening the electricity market
in Great Britain, for the 25 million domestic
customers and small businesses taking 100 kW
of power or less, began in September 1998. The
market is being opened region by region
according to customers’ postcodes and should be
completed by March 1999 for businesses and by
June 1999 for domestic customers. Even in the
early stages of the process there is evidence of
keen competition between British Gas and
incumbent electricity suppliers—particularly in
serving customers who are prepared to buy gas
and electricity from the same suppliers.
Following concern arising from practices
adopted by some doorstep salesmen, the
electricity and gas regulators have both
introduced licence conditions requiring that
companies adhere to certain marketing
standards. The industry has introduced a
supplementary code through its Association of
Energy Services.
Regulation and other Functions
Regulation of the industry in Great Britain is
primarily the responsibility of Offer, headed
498
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
by the DOES, whose duties include the
promotion of competition and protection of
customer interests. The Government has
announced the merger of Offer and Ofgas
from 1 January 1999, when the Director
General of Gas Supply (see p. 496) will also
assume the role of DGES. The Electricity
Association is the principal trade body for the
industry. It carries out representative and co¬
ordinating functions for all the major
companies and has a number of overseas
members.
Consumption
In 1997 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in the UK amounted to
301 TWh. Domestic users took 34.5% of the
total, industry 31.5%, and commercial and
other users the remainder.
In 1997 the average industrial electricity
price was lower in real terms than for any year
since 1970. Domestic electricity bills in the
UK are now on average 9.5% lower since
privatisation in 1990, with industrial bills
about 22% lower. In 1997 an annual electricity
bill for a typical household was £285. Average
UK domestic electricity prices, including
taxes, in 1997 were the fourth lowest within
the G7 and the sixth lowest within the EU.

The shares of generating capacity during
1996-98 are shown in Table 29.3.
Non-nuclear power stations owned by the
UK’s major power producers consumed over
48 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1997, of
which coal accounted for 57%, natural gas
40% and oil 3%. Other power companies (for
whom gas is the most widely used fuel), and
an increasing number of small autogenerators
(who produce power for their own use), have
equal access with the major generators to the
grid transmission and local distribution
systems.
A ten-year programme to control emissions
of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) through the
installation of low-NOx burners at 12 major
power stations in England and Wales is in
progress. ScottishPower has fitted low-NOx
burners at Longannet.
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT)
Between 1991 and 1996 the cost of CCGT plant
fell by more than 30% in real terms. In 1997,
CCGT stations accounted for 27% of the
electricity generated by major power producers,
compared with 7% in 1993. This increase has
been balanced by a fall in coal- and oil-fired
generation. CCGT stations, favoured by the
smaller, independent producers and using
natural gas, offer cheap generation, and give out
almost no sulphur dioxide and some 55% less
C02 than coal-fired plant per unit of electricity.
In England and Wales, 21 such stations (with a
total registered capacity of 14.2 GW) are
generating power. The review of energy sources
for power stations has considered the
implications of high levels of dependence on any
one fuel and in particular the growing
dependence on gas and the role of coal when a
diverse, sustainable and secure spread of sources
is desirable. The Government is consulting on
proposals to introduce conditions for granting
consents to build new gas-fired power stations.
Combined Heat and Power
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants are
designed to produce both electricity and
usable heat. They can be up to three times

more efficient than conventional generation,
because they retain and utilise the heat
produced in the generating process, rather
than discarding it, as conventional generation
does. This benefits the environment by
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. CHP
is now used for cooling and chilling.
CHP can be fuelled by a variety of energy
sources. It offers particular benefits in
applications where there is a regular need for
heat as well as electricity—hospitals, leisure
centres, housing developments—and can be
provided on a local scale. In 1997 over 1,300
CHP schemes supplied 4,000 MW of
generating capacity, 6% of the UK’s total
electricity (and 15% of that used by industry),
with 400 schemes under construction; the
government target is 5,000 MW by the year
2000. EU strategy is to double CHP’s share of
the electricity market from 9% to 18% by 2010,
to promote it by tax incentives and to increase
the portion of EU funds allotted to it by EU
programmes. The Netherlands, Denmark and
Finland each use CHP to generate over 30% of
their total electricity needs.
Trade
The NGC and Electricite de France run a
2,000 MW cross-Channel cable link, allowing
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. The link has generally been used to
supply ‘baseload’ power—which needs to be
generated and available round the clock—from
France to England. Imports met about 5% of
the UK’s electricity needs in 1997.
Scotland has a peak winter demand of
under 6 GW. It therefore has additional
available capacity (see p. 498) which is used to
supply England and Wales through
transmission lines linking the Scottish and
English grid systems. This interconnector’s
capacity is now 1,600 MW, with plans to
increase it to 2,200 MW. NIE and
ScottishPower plan to construct a 60-km
(37.5-mile) long 250 MW undersea
interconnector, costing £200 million, to
supply electricity to the Northern Ireland
system.
Nuclear Power
The EU nuclear industry is the biggest in the
world, employing 400,000 workers, with the
140 reactors of the eight EU nuclear powers
producing a third of EU electricity output.
This substantially reduces the use of fossil
fuels which would otherwise be needed for
generation—in the UK by 29% in 1997. Such
500
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
an amount would cause annual emissions of up
to 20.5 million tonnes of C02. In the EU as a
whole the amount avoided has been calculated
at 700 million tonnes. However, there are
currently no plans to build new nuclear power
generation plants in the UK. Any future
proposals for new capacity would be a matter
for the generator to formulate, based upon
commercial criteria.
The privatised nuclear industry in Britain
consists of British Energy pic, and its two
subsidiaries: Nuclear Electric Ltd, which
operates the pressurised water reactor (PWR)
and five advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR)
stations in England and Wales; and Scottish
Nuclear Ltd, which operates the two AGR
stations in Scotland. The British nuclear
power generation industry achieved record
output of 89 TWh in 1997, as well as
contributing, at 28%, its highest ever
proportion of total electricity generation.
Nuclear Electric’s reactors have an aggregate
capacity of 7,200 MW and Scottish Nuclear’s
of about 2,400 MW. Scotland’s electricity
needs are also met from using hydro, coal and
gas resources, which have a total output
capacity of approximately 9,300 MW. Scottish
Nuclear sells 74.9% of its output to
ScottishPower and the rest to Hydro-Electric.
A segregated fund was established on the
privatisation of British Energy, with a £228
million initial endowment from the nuclear
companies, to cover the eventual cost of
decommissioning its reactors. British Energy
is contributing a further £16 million a year.
British Nuclear Fuels’ (BNFL) Magnox
Generation Business Group operates eight
magnox power stations which remain in public
ownership, together with a further three
magnox stations that are being
decommissioned. The first stage of the merger
of the publicly owned Magnox Electric and
BNFL was completed early in 1998; full
integration of the combined businesses is
expected to come about in 1999. The
Government expects the merged group to
reduce substantially the cost of eventually
closing the magnox reactors and cleaning the
sites. It has undertaken to pay BNFL £3,700
million to decommission reactors in the next
century, £600 million less than the estimated
value in March 1998 of the Government’s
undertaking to finance Magnox Electric’s
nuclear liabilities. BNFL accepted the lower
figure because the Government agreed to
make regular payments beginning in 2006-07.
The Fossil Fuel Levy Act 1998 ensures
that nuclear electricity from licensed
suppliers, or imported from France, is subject
to the fossil fuel levy (see p. 502).
British Nuclear Fuels
BNFL is Britain’s publicly owned primary
provider of nuclear fuel cycle services—from
fuel manufacture and transportation to
recycling used nuclear fuel and associated
waste management and decommissioning—for
both UK and international customers. Its
profit before tax in 1997-98 was £199 million,
on sales of £1,341 million. The thermal oxide
reprocessing plant (THORP) at Sellafield
(Cumbria), which won a consent to operate in
1997, has reprocessing orders worth £12,000
million, a third of which come from overseas.
The Sellafield Mixed Oxide Fuel plant, which
is awaiting authorisation to start operations,
mixes oxide fuel with depleted, natural or
recycled uranium and plutonium, recovered
from used nuclear fuel reprocessed in
THORP.
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
UKAEA’s main function is to maintain and
decommission safely and cost-effectively its
redundant nuclear facilities used for the UK’s
nuclear R&D programme. UKAEA owns the
sites at Dounreay (Caithness), Culham and
Harwell (Oxfordshire), Windscale (Cumbria)
and Winfrith (Dorset), and is also responsible
for Britain’s fusion programme (see p. 502).
No further commercial reprocessing contracts
will be accepted at Dounreay. The plant will
be decommissioned after it has finished
dealing with its own fuel; a small quantity of
highly enriched uranium and spent radioactive
fuel imported from Georgia; and other
existing commercial contracts.

science, environmental management,

Nuclear Research
Nuclear fusion in the UK is funded by the
DTI and Euratom (75% and 25%
respectively). The Government spends almost
£15 million a year on fusion research, of
which the main focus is magnetic
confinement, based at Culham, where
Britain’s own nuclear fusion research is
carried out. However, the UK is also a partner
in the experimental EU JET (Joint European
Torus) project, also at Culham. The EU has
agreed to extend JET, which in 1997
generated a record of 12 MW of fusion power
in one second, to the end of 1999. As a follow¬
up to JET, the experimental ITER
(International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor) is in its detailed project phase; the
objective is to show the scientific and
technological feasibility of power production
from fusion energy for peaceful purposes.
Nuclear Safety
Responsibility for ensuring the safety of
nuclear installations falls to nuclear operators
within a system of regulatory control enforced
by the HSE.
The international Convention on Nuclear
Safety came into force in 1996. So far, 46
countries, including the UK, have ratified it.
Before April 1999, each country will produce a
national report describing the progress it has
made in meeting the nuclear safety obligations
set out in the Convention.
The UK’s main contribution to the
international effort to improve safety in
Central and Eastern Europe and in the Newly
Independent States is channelled through the
EU PHARE and TACIS nuclear safety
programmes. An agreement between the G8
countries and Ukraine on the closure of the
Chernobyl nuclear plant by 2000 involves
some US $500 million in grants and US
$1,800 million in projected investments by
international financial institutions, including
2,400 million ECUs in loans from Euratom,
which co-ordinates and develops the EU’s
nuclear industries.
NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF
ENERGY
The Government’s new and renewable energy
programme, on which it expects to spend over
£11 million in 1998-99, covers biofuels
(including wastes), fuel cells, hydro, solar and
wind. These accounted for 2% of all
electricity generating capacity in Britain in
1997; natural flow hydro schemes provided
about three-quarters of this total. Although
capacity for renewables generation other than
hydro is four times the level in 1990,
renewables provided only about 0.9% of the
electricity available in the UK in 1997
(compared with 25% for Sweden, over 7% for
Denmark and nearly 2% for Germany). The
Government is reviewing what needs to be
done to achieve the target of meeting 10% of
the UK’s electricity needs from renewables by
2010. The European Commission’s renewable
energy White Paper, issued at the end of 1997,
proposes a doubling of the current
contribution of renewables to gross inland
energy consumption to 12% by 2010.
The non-fossil fuel obligation (NFFO)
requires each public electricity supplier (PES)
to reserve capacity for a certain amount of
electricity to be generated from non-fossil and
non-nuclear sources. PESs must then buy
renewables-sourced power at a premium price,
above the market price for conventionally
generated electricity, and are reimbursed the
difference through the fossil fuel levy, which
is paid by all electricity consumers through
their bills; some £116 million was paid in
1997-98 under the NFFO arrangements for
renewables. (In Scotland the term Scottish
Renewables Obligation—SRO—is used.)
Four Renewables Orders have been made
for England and Wales and two each for
Scotland and Northern Ireland. At the end of
June 1998, 533 projects contracted in England
and Wales under these Orders had a net
capacity of 2,094 MW. The fifth Order, made
in September 1998, is for 261 projects with
1,177 MW capacity. The first two SROs were
for 56 contracts with 190 MW capacity; the
third, announced in December 1997, was for
502

projects totalling 110-122 MW capacity. The
two Northern Ireland Orders involve 30
projects with 32 MW capacity. By 30 June
1998, 528 MW of renewable energy
generating capacity (from 211 projects) had
been commissioned under the four NFFO
Orders for England and Wales, with a further
27 MW (from 10 projects) commissioned
under the first two SROs and 15 MW (from
14 projects) commissioned under the first two
Northern Ireland Orders. The cost of
renewable energy under successive Orders has
fallen significantly.
Exports of renewable energy technology
are estimated to have risen to between £80
and £100 million a year over the period
1996-98.
Northumbrian Water is building a £70
million sludge treatment centre at Bran Sands
in Teesside, next to an £11 million
gasification plant where dried sewage sludge
pellets will be turned into fuel gas. This will
power turbines to create 5 MW of electricity,
enough for 20,000 people. The electricity
produced will contribute to the cost of the
sewage treatment by powering the site or by
export to the National Grid; the heat
generated will be used in the sludge dryers in
a self-sustaining process aimed at making the
plant ultimately energy self-sufficient.
The DTI supports the Foresight
SCOLAR programme, which aims to put
various fuel cell systems into a hundred
schools and colleges throughout the UK.
British organisations play an active part in EU
programmes. In the final THERMIE round,
British participants were involved in eight of
the 38 projects funded, taking the lead in
six—all located in the UK and with a total
EU contribution of 6.38 million ECUs,
representing 28% of the total 23.2 million
ECUs renewable energy budget.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The Royal Dutch Shell group is committing
£300 million to developing solar energy and
sustainable forestry. BP has invested over
£160 million in its solar energy business.
Plans exist for solar panels supplied by BP to
generate 10% of the electricity consumed at
St James’s Park stadium, the headquarters of
Newcastle United FC, when it is enlarged.
The project will contribute to Newcastle
upon Tyne’s target of generating 1% of its
electricity from solar power by 2010. Of the
RECs, Eastern Electricity has promised to
invest up to £1 million in renewables to
match whatever is spent by customers under
its Ecopower tariff (for electricity generated
by renewables), which commands a 10%
premium. Ford has built one of Europe’s
largest manufacturing solar power generators
on the roof of its plant at Bridgend in Wales,
at a cost of £1.5 million, with funding from
the DTI and EU. It covers 25,000 square
feet, nearly one-tenth of the factory area, and
will generate enough power to provide all the
lighting on the site, which employs 1,300
people and operates round the clock
throughout the year.
The Renewable Energy Company
(which has 17 MW spare capacity), founded
in 1996, sold £4 million worth of electricity
in 1997, mainly from landfill gas. It charges
the same tariff as suppliers of conventional
electricity and plans to bring its first
wind-generated power on stream during
1998-99.

ENERGY AND NATURAE RESOURCES
Some Minerals Produced in Britain
505
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Non-energy Minerals
Output of non-energy minerals in 1996
totalled 310 million tonnes, valued at £2,134
million. The total number of employees in the
extractive industry was nearly 27,000.
In the Crediton Trough area of mid-
Devon, two phases of drilling by Crediton
Minerals have encountered gold enrichment.
Further exploration is planned. South Crofty
in Cornwall, the only remaining tin mine in
the UK, closed in March 1998, thus bringing
to an end 2,500 years of tin production in
Britain. Low tin prices and competition from
overseas combined with a strong pound to
make the mine unviable. During 1997, its last
full year of operation, 2,396 tonnes of tin
metal-in-concentrate were produced, with a
value of £8 million. Total value of output
from the Boulby potash mine in north-east
England was £96 million in 1996, making it
the UK’s most important non-energy mineral
operation.
Trade and Production
The largest non-energy mineral imports are
metals (ores, concentrates and scrap—valued
at £1,616 million in 1996), refined non-
ferrous metals (£3,832 million) and non-
metallic mineral products (£4,557 million, of
which rough diamonds account for £2,860
million). The UK is virtually self-sufficient in
construction minerals, and produces and
exports several industrial minerals, notably
china clay, ball clay, potash and salt. China
clay is the largest export—£207 million in
1996.
Water Supply
About 75% of the UK’s water supplies are
obtained from mountain lakes, reservoirs and
river intakes; and about 25% from
underground sources. Heavy winter rains in
1997-98 and April flooding have reversed
three years of drought and dwindling supplies
in England. River flows were at or above
average in spring 1998 and reservoirs full or
nearly full, except in south-east England and
East Anglia, where there is still uncertainty
about how much the rain has replenished
underground water levels (stored in layers of
porous rock), which have been at a record low
in many places. These regions are more
dependent on groundwater than any other
parts of England.
By contrast, Scotland and Wales have a
relative abundance of unpolluted water from
upland sources and Scotland is in a position to
export it. Northern Ireland also has plentiful
supplies for domestic use and for industry.
Water put into the public supply system
(including industrial and other uses) in
England and Wales averaged 16,661
megalitres (Ml) a day in 1996-97, of which
average daily consumption per head was about
150 litres. An average of 2,312 Ml a day was
supplied in Scotland in 1996-97. In Northern
Ireland the figure was 707 Ml a day.
Some 59,503 Ml a day were abstracted
from rivers in England and Wales in 1996, of
which public water supplies accounted for
17,453 Ml a day. The electricity supply
industry took 31,294 Ml a day; fish farming,
cress growing and amenity ponds 4,338 Ml a
day; and agriculture 136 Ml a day, with spray
irrigation accounting for a further 369 Ml a
day.
England and Wales
Water Companies
Ten water and sewerage companies in
England and Wales have statutory
responsibilities for water supply, its quality
and sufficiency, and for sewerage and sewage
treatment. The supply-only companies, after
various mergers since 1989, have decreased in
number from 29 to 18. They supply water to
nearly a quarter of the population.
In April 1998 the Government set out
proposals for water charging, the key elements
of which are:
• families on low incomes or with special
needs who live in a property with a
metered supply would have the right to
choose a charge based on average
household use rather than on their actual
meter reading;
• charging for water on the basis of the
rateable value of a property would be
allowed to continue beyond 2000 for
506
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
those who pay on an unmeasured basis
and use water only for essential domestic
purposes;
• water companies would lose their power to
disconnect household supplies in the
event of non-payment, as water is essential
to good health and well-being; and
• households would have the choice of a
meter, free of charge, if it suited them, to
help ensure their water was used
efficiently.
About 11% of households and 76% of
commercial and industrial customers are
currently charged for water on the basis of
consumption measured by meter. Most homes
are charged according to the rateable value of
the property. Thirteen companies already
provide free meter installation for households
on request. Most companies have a policy of
metering businesses and new homes, and some
companies have extended this to cover
households with garden sprinklers and
swimming pools.
The Director General of Water Services,
who heads Ofwat, the industry’s regulatory
body, has said that water customers, in
common with those in other utilities, deserve a
dividend based on past efficiency. He believes
this can be afforded while maintaining a high
level of investment in the environment and in
customer service. Research by Water UK, the
industry’s trade association, suggests that 57%
of customers are prepared to see bills rise in
line with inflation to fund environmental and
service improvements. A survey of 2,500
customers by the Environment Agency (see
p. 329) revealed that most people would prefer
to forgo price reductions if savings were used
to reduce pollution and improve the
environment. The Agency also says that past
and future efficiency savings by the companies
provide scope for a substantial programme of
environmental improvements without bills
rising in real terms.
The overall quality of UK drinking water is
high: 99.75% of some 3 million tests in
England and Wales in 1997 met standards that
are in some cases more strict than those in the
1980 EC Drinking Water Directive. A new
EC Directive, adopted in 1998, requires
member states to meet a number of even more
stringent standards, especially for lead, with
an obligation to ensure maximum
concentrations of lead in water of 25
microgrammes per litre within five years and
10 pg/1 within 15. Many properties in the UK
already meet the 15-year target.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI)
checks that water companies in England and
Wales meet the drinking water quality
regulations. Enforcement action is taken when
there are infringements of standards. The
DWI also investigates incidents and consumer
complaints about quality, and initiates
prosecution if water unfit for human
consumption has been supplied.
Thames Water is to spend £8 million on
four new pumping stations to try to stem
rising groundwater which is threatening
foundations and basements in London.
Levels are increasing by up to 10 feet (3
metres) a year. The water started to rise in
the 1960s, when heavy industrial users of
water, such as breweries, began to move
away from the capital.
Ensuring Supplies
An Environment Agency study published in
March 1998 concludes that there are 1,000
million litres less available from lakes, rivers
and aquifers each day than was estimated in
the early 1990s, and expresses concern over
the resilience of some water supply systems in
the face of severe drought. The Government
intends to put time limits on all new water
abstraction licences as a key part of a range of
reforms to the abstraction licensing system
which has remained mostly unchanged since
the early 1960s.
The Director General of Water Services
sets each water company mandatory leakage
targets. By spring 1999 companies will have
been expected to reduce overall leakage from
4,528 Ml a day (1996-97) to 3,612 Ml a day, a
16% reduction on the targets for 1997-98.
The industry is committed to spending £816
million on leakage repair over 1998-2000 and
£1,700 million on mains rehabilitation and
replacement.
507
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Water company investment for 1997-98
increased by 11%, largely in the repair of
leakages. All the companies offer a free leak-
repair service for customers’ supply pipes.
Proposed new water regulations to replace the
old water bye-laws will reduce the maximum
flush volume of new lavatories from 7.5 to 6
litres. Some companies have adopted water¬
saving measures, which include free plumbing
help in fitting devices to cisterns, checking
overflow efficiency and replacing faulty washers.
Scotland
Since 1996, responsibility for the provision of all
water and sewerage services has rested with
three public water authorities—the North, West
and East of Scotland Water Authorities. The
Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers
Council protects and represents all their
customers. It also approves the water authorities’
charging schemes and codes of practice, and is
financed by an annual levy on the authorities.
Prices for water supply depend on the type
of consumer: domestic consumers pay amounts
based on their council tax band (see p. 398) or
metered charges, and non-domestic pay non¬
domestic water rates, or metered charges. For
sewerage services, domestic consumers pay a
sewerage charge based on their council tax
band, and non-domestic pay non-domestic
sewerage rates, and, where appropriate, trade
effluent charges for the licensed outflow of
industrial wastewater. Charges and rates are a
matter for each water authority, but their
charges schemes must be approved by the
Customers Council. In 1997 the Government
allowed the water authorities to make average
price increases of 32%, to ensure a high
standard of clean and safe water. The average
annual household water and sewerage charge
has risen from £109 to £144, compared with the
average in England and Wales of £225.
The Government is to abolish the
Customers Council and replace it with a
regulator to oversee the water industry, and
has also appointed more local councillors to
water authority boards.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for public
water supply and sewerage throughout the
Province. It is also responsible for the
conservation and cleanliness of water
resources and, with the Department of
Agriculture, prepares, if necessary, water
management programmes for any area. A
domestic water charge is contained in local
rates, while agriculture, commerce and
industry pay metered charges.

The service sector in the United Kingdom is continuing to grow and now
contributes about 66% of gross value added at constant 1995 prices and 75% of
employment. The number of employees has risen by around 13% in the last ten
years, to 17.6 million by June 1998.
In the financial sector traditional distinctions between financial institutions
are being eroded, with single firms supplying a broader range of services and
new entrants from other sectors, such as supermarkets. Telephone-based
services are becoming much more widespread, for example in banking and in
motor and household insurance, while the use of credit cards and debit cards
has grown rapidly. The system of financial regulation and supervision is being
overhauled, and a new Financial Services Authority has been established. Net
overseas earnings of the UK financial sector were a record £25,200 million in
1997, 32% more than in 1996.
As a result of rising real incomes, consumer
spending on financial, personal and leisure
services has increased considerably. Travel,
hotel and restaurant services in the UK are
among those to have benefited from the growth
in tourism over recent years, and the UK is one
of the world’s leading tourist destinations.
Computer and business services are among the
non-fmancial sectors which experienced strong
growth in turnover in 1997 (see Table 30.1).
Financial Services
Historically the heart of the UK financial
services industry has been in the ‘Square Mile’
in the City of London, and this remains
broadly the case. Among the major financial
institutions and markets in the City are the
Bank of England, the London Stock
Exchange, Lloyd’s insurance market, and the
London International Financial Futures and

Options Exchange. The City is one of the
world’s three leading financial centres, along
with Tokyo and New York, and by far the
biggest in Europe. An important feature is the
size of its international activities. It is noted
for having:
• more overseas banks than any other
financial centre;
• one of the world’s largest international
insurance markets;
• the biggest market in the world for
trading foreign equities, accounting for
59% of global turnover;
• by far the world’s biggest foreign
exchange market, actively trading the
largest range of currencies and handling
about 32% of worldwide dealing;
• the largest fund management centre, with
around US $1,807,500 million of
institutional equity holdings;
• the major international centre for
primary and secondary dealing in the
Euromarket; and
• important markets for transactions in
commodities.
A full range of ancillary and support
services—including legal, accountancy and
management consultancy services—contribute
to London’s strength as a financial centre.
London is also the most important centre in
the world for advice on privatisation.
Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow) ranks
the fifth largest centre in the EU, in terms of
institutional equity funds managed.
Manchester, Cardiff, Liverpool and Leeds are
also important financial centres.
British Invisibles (BI) promotes the UK as
the world’s foremost international centre for
financial and related services, and seeks to
promote a better understanding within the
UK of the role of financial services and their
contribution to the economy. BI also helps
businesses to develop commercial
opportunities internationally, and works to
achieve greater liberalisation of international
trade in financial and related services.
Although the UK is not joining the
European single currency when it is launched
in 1999 (see p. 77), the introduction of the
euro will have a major effect in many areas of
financial services. Considerable preparation
has been made by UK banks and other
financial institutions to ensure that the
necessary payment, settlement and other
facilities are in place, and that the euro will
play a major role in London trading.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
HM Treasury is the government department
with principal responsibility for the law and
the regulatory framework applied to the
financial services sector. In 1997 the
Government announced proposals to simplify
510
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
and reform the regulatory structure. As a
result, a new single supervisor, the Financial
Services Authority (FSA), which will
eventually cover providers of banking,
investment and insurance, was launched in
October 1997.
FSA Functions and Objectives
Initially, the FSA took over the functions
performed by the Securities and Investments
Board, which had responsibility for
recognising the three self-regulating
organisations (see box) and several
professional bodies. It also supervises the
UK’s six recognised investment exchanges
(such as the London Stock Exchange), and is
responsible for recognising and supervising
the clearing houses, which organise the
settlement of transactions on these exchanges.
In June 1998, under the Bank of England Act
1998 (see p. 512), the FSA acquired from the
Bank responsibility for banking supervision.
A draft Bill, providing for the replacement
of the current system based on self-regulation
by a fully statutory system, was issued for
consultation in July 1998. The draft Bill sets
out statutory objectives for the FSA, including
maintaining confidence in the UK financial
system and promoting public understanding
of it, protecting consumers and reducing
financial crime. In delivering these objectives,
the FSA would be required to be efficient
and economic, to facilitate innovation in
financial services and to take account of the
international nature of financial services
business.
Banking Supervision
The FSA’s arrangements for supervising the
banks are intended to strengthen, but not
guarantee, the protection of bank depositors,
thereby increasing confidence in the banking
system as a whole. Banks are required to meet
minimum standards on the integrity and
competence of directors and management, the
adequacy of capital and cash flow, and the
systems and controls to deal with the risks
experienced by banks. If a bank fails to meet
the criteria, its activities may be restricted, or
it may be closed.
As well as the functions covered by the
former Securities and Investments Board
and those previously handled by the Bank
of England, the other regulatory bodies
which will eventually come under the FSA
are:
• the Building Societies Commission;
• the Friendly Societies Commission;
• the Registry of Friendly Societies;
• the Insurance Directorate of HM
Treasury; and
• three self-regulating organisations—
the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation (regulating
about 1,100 fund management firms),
the Securities and Futures Authority
(covering most aspects of securities
trading and having about 1,300
members) and the Personal
Investment Authority (PIA,
regulating about 4,000 firms,
including product providers and
independent financial advisers).
Compensation Schemes
Various compensation schemes, funded by the
financial services providers, exist to protect
investors and depositors if authorised firms
are unable to meet their liabilities:
• the Deposit Protection Scheme, for bank

Investor Protection Scheme, which both
provide customers with protection of up
to 90% of their deposits, subject to a
maximum for each scheme of £18,000;
• the Policyholders Protection Scheme, which
provides protection for certain insurance
company policyholders of 100% of
claims on specified compulsory insurance
policies and 90% on other policies, with
no maximum limit; and
• the Investors Compensation Scheme, which
can make payments of up to £48,000 to
private investors if a regulated firm is
unable to meet its investment business
liabilities—since 1988 it has helped

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
customers of about 420 firms, and paid
out nearly £129 million to more than
11,400 investors.
The Government’s view is that the existing
diverse arrangements should be rationalised.
Accordingly, a new single Financial Services
and Markets Compensation Scheme is
planned and will be run by a single board,
which will be accountable to the FSA.
Ombudsmen
Currently there are a number of ombudsmen
who consider complaints about financial
services. To simplify the arrangements, the
draft Bill provides for a new Financial
Services Ombudsman to be a single point of
access for complaints. This would bring
together eight main schemes, including those
covering banking, building societies, insurance
and firms conducting investment business. All
firms authorised by the FSA would have to
observe the Ombudsman’s procedures.
International Agreements
HM Treasury represents the UK in
negotiating and ensuring the implementation
of relevant EC directives on the financial
services sector, co-ordinating as necessary
with the FSA, the Bank of England and other
bodies. The main purpose of such directives is
to provide a regulatory framework to allow
banking, investment and insurance firms to
operate throughout the European Economic
Area (EEA, see p. 78) on the basis of their
home state authorisation.
The UK plays a major role in encouraging
international regulatory co-operation in a
variety of international organisations. These
include the Group of Seven (G7) leading
major industrialised countries, other
intergovernmental forums and, at the
technical level, the Bank for International
Settlements, the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision and the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions.
Cross-border information-sharing
arrangements contribute to the success of such
co-operation, with the regulatory bodies
playing a key role.
The UK is at the forefront of action to
encourage international liberalisation in
financial services. Negotiations on
liberalising trade in financial services
were completed in the World Trade
Organisation (see p. 407) in December
1997. New non-discriminatory
commitments, which come into force in
March 1999, are expected to result in
improved access to financial services
markets around the world.
BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its capital stock was acquired
by the Government in 1946. As the UK’s
central bank, its overriding objective is to
maintain a stable and efficient monetary and
financial framework for the effective operation
of the economy. In pursuing this goal, it has
three main purposes:
• maintaining the integrity and value of the
currency;
• maintaining the stability of the financial
system; and
• seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the
financial services sector.
Fundamental changes affecting the Bank’s
role were announced by the Government in
May 1997 and implemented under the Bank of
England Act 1998. The main changes involve
the acquisition of operational responsibility for
setting interest rates, and the transfer of its
responsibility for banking supervision to the
FSA (see p. 511) and for management of the
Government’s debt and the oversight of the
gilts market to the Debt Management Office,
an executive agency of the Treasury (see
p. 393).
Monetary Policy Framework
The Bank’s monetary policy objective is to
deliver price stability, as defined by the target
stipulated by the Government (see p. 387), by
setting short-term interest rates. This
512
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
responsibility rests with the Bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee, which comprises the
Governor, the two Deputy Governors and six
other members. The Committee meets
monthly and interest rate decisions are
announced as soon as is practicable after the
meeting. The Committee is accountable to the
Bank’s Court of Directors and to Parliament.
Financial Stability
Under the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Bank, HM Treasury and the
FSA, agreed in 1997, the Bank retains
responsibility for the overall stability of the
financial system. In exceptional
circumstances, the Bank may provide financial
support as a last resort to prevent problems
affecting one financial institution spreading to
other parts of the financial system. The Bank
also oversees the effectiveness of the financial
sector in meeting the needs of customers and
in maintaining the sector’s international
competitiveness. In this context, the Bank has
been working to ensure the readiness of the
UK’s ‘wholesale’ financial services sector for
the introduction of the euro (see p. 77).
Other Main Functions
The Bank’s money market operations are
designed to smooth out fluctuations in the
flow of cash between the Government and the
private sector, and to steer short-term market
interest rates to levels required to implement
monetary policy. Through its daily operations
in the money market, the Bank supplies the
funds which the banking system as a whole
needs to achieve balance by the end of each
settlement day.
The Bank acts as the Treasury’s agent in
managing the Government’s reserves of gold
and foreign exchange and its foreign currency
borrowing. Under the 1998 Act, it now has its
own pool of foreign exchange reserves which it
may use to intervene in support of its
monetary policy objective.
The Bank provides banking services to its
customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It
plays a key role in payment and settlement
systems, and has sole right in England and
Wales to issue banknotes, which are backed by
government and other securities. The profit
from the note issue is paid directly to the
Government. Three Scottish and four
Northern Ireland banks may also issue notes,
but these have to be fully backed by Bank of
England notes.
Court of Directors
The Bank of England Act 1998 has reformed
the Court of Directors of the Bank of England,
which meets at least once a month and is
responsible for managing the affairs of the
Bank other than the formulation of monetary
policy. The Court has been reconstituted to
include the Governor, the two Deputy
Governors and 16 Directors. The Directors
form a sub-committee; functions include
reviewing the Bank’s performance and the
internal procedures of the Monetary Policy
Committee. The Court is required to report
annually to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
BANKING SERVICES
The main financial institutions offering
banking services are banks and building
societies. However, the distinction between
them is narrowing, as both types of institution
diversify their services.
As well as ‘retail’ banking, which primarily
provides deposit, withdrawal and loan
facilities for personal customers and small
businesses, nearly all banks engage in some
‘wholesale’ activities. These involve taking
larger deposits, deploying funds in money-
market instruments (see p. 522), and making
corporate loans and investments. Some banks,
such as the merchant banks and overseas
banks operating in the UK, concentrate on
wholesale business. Many dealings are
conducted on the inter-bank market, between
banks themselves.
In 1998 there were 362 institutions
authorised under the Banking Act 1987,
including clearing banks, investment banks,
branches of overseas banks from outside the
EEA, and banking subsidiaries of banking and
non-banking institutions from the UK and

overseas. A further 105 branches of banks
from other EEA countries were entitled to
accept deposits in the UK. There are 538
institutions permitted to take deposits in the
UK, including building societies.
Retail Banks and Banking Groups
Banks feature prominently among the UK’s
biggest companies (see p. 432). Among the
largest banks, in terms of market
capitalisation, are Lloyds TSB, HSBC
(including its subsidiary Midland), Halifax,
Barclays, National Westminster, Abbey
National, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of
Scotland, Woolwich, and Alliance & Leicester.
Standard Chartered, which mainly operates
overseas, has a network of around 500 offices
in nearly 50 countries, notably in Asia, Africa
and the Middle East. Among the smaller retail
banks are Northern Rock, the Co-operative
Bank and two banks owned by National
Australia Bank: the Clydesdale Bank and the
Yorkshire Bank. Northern Ireland is served by
branch networks of four major banking
groups: Northern Bank, Ulster Bank, First
Trust Bank and Bank of Ireland.
Two major changes have recently affected
retail banking:
• Several of the largest building
societies have joined the banking
sector. Abbey National was the first
to convert to a bank, in 1989, and in
1997 Halifax, Woolwich, Alliance &
Leicester, and Northern Rock became
banks.
• Other businesses, notably insurance
companies and supermarkets, have
begun to offer banking facilities.
Supermarkets, in particular, have
attracted large numbers of depositors.
For example, Sainsbury’s Bank, a
joint venture with the Bank of
Scotland, has over 700,000 customers
and deposits of £1,500 million. Tesco
and Safeway also provide banking
services, run in conjunction with
major banks. Among insurance
companies offering banking services
are Prudential, Standard Life, and
Legal & General.
Traditional banking services generally
available include current accounts, deposit
accounts and loan arrangements. Retail banks
now offer many additional services: credit and
debit cards are widely available, as are
mortgages, insurance, investment products—
including TESSAs, PEPs, pensions and unit
trusts—and share-dealing services. Most
major UK banks own finance houses, leasing
and factoring companies, insurance companies
and unit trust companies. Some also have
overseas subsidiaries or branches.
Competition among the banks and other
financial institutions is intense, especially in
the markets for personal savings, consumer
credit and mortgages. Banks have acted to
increase efficiency and control costs by, for
example, providing new services and
extending opening hours. However, the
network of bank branches has fallen, in part
because of the move to telephone and
computer banking (see p. 517), and staff levels
have declined, especially through centralising
‘back-office’ operations and reducing head
office and support functions. Profitability has
514
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
risen, reflecting, among other things, the
strengthening of the economy, cost savings
and lower bad debts; in 1997 pre-tax profits of
the eight large UK banks totalled £11,100
million. Total liabilities/assets of banks in the
UK amounted to about £2,628,800 million at
the end of July 1998.
Investment Banks
Investment banks offer a range of professional
financial services, including corporate finance
and asset management. They have an
important role in equity and debt markets,
with securities trading and futures and options
business (see p. 522) playing a bigger role. A
major activity is the provision of advice and
financial services to industrial companies,
especially in the case of mergers, takeovers
and other forms of corporate reorganisation.
Investment banks have considerable expertise
in advising governments on privatisation. As
with retail banks, there has been a process of
consolidation, and several UK-owned
investment banks have been acquired by
overseas concerns. In terms of activity in
mergers and acquisitions in 1997, the largest
investment banks in the City were Lazard,
SBC Warburg Dillon Read, Schroders,
Goldman Sachs and NM Rothschild.
Overseas Banks
The UK, with around 20% of cross-border
bank lending, is the world’s largest single
market for international banking. Banks from
around 80 countries have subsidiaries,
branches or representative offices in London.
France has the greatest number—50—
followed by Japan, Italy and the United
States. Like the major UK banks, these
overseas banks offer a comprehensive banking
service in many parts of the world, and engage
in financing trade not only between the UK
and other countries but also between third-
party countries.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers. As well
as their retail deposit-taking services, they
specialise in housing finance, making long¬
term mortgage loans against the security of
property—usually private dwellings
purchased for owner-occupation. Some of the
larger societies provide a full range of personal
banking services.
There are 71 authorised building societies,
of which 70 are members of the Building
Societies Association, with assets of around
£138,000 million. The largest is the
Nationwide, with assets of £46,300 million.
Other large societies are Bradford & Bingley,
Britannia and Yorkshire.
During 1997 the sector shrank considerably
when four of the ten biggest societies
abandoned their mutual status and became
banks (see p. 514). Members of these societies
voted for conversion by large majorities. A
fifth large society—Bristol & West—was
taken over by the Bank of Ireland. Although
assets of the sector have fallen substantially
and building societies no longer have the
largest share of the housing finance market,
they are still competing fiercely with the banks
and are taking a significant share of new
mortgages and attracting substantial deposits
from savers. Several of the largest societies
have committed themselves to remaining
mutually owned. In July 1998 a proposal for
the Nationwide to convert to a bank was
narrowly defeated in a poll of members.
However, Birmingham Midshires—the fifth
largest society, which had indicated in August
1997 its intention to convert—has agreed,
subject to approval by its members, to a
takeover by Halifax pic in 1999.
Diversification
The Building Societies Act 1986 enabled
societies to diversify into a wider range of
financial and housing-related services. The
Building Societies Act 1997 established a new,
even more ‘permissive’ regime whereby, with
a few exceptions, societies could undertake an
unrestricted variety of activities, enabling
them to respond quickly to developments in
the financial services and housing markets.
The chief requirements for societies are that:
• their principal purpose is making loans
which are secured on residential property
515
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
and are funded substantially by their
members;
• at least 75% of lending has to be on the
security of housing; and
• a minimum of 50% of funds must be in
the form of shares held by individual
members.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card
arrangements, the main payment systems are
run by three separate companies operating
under an umbrella organisation, the
Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS). One system covers bulk paper
clearings—cheques and credit transfers. A
second deals with high-value clearings for
same-day settlement, namely the nationwide
electronic transfer service, Clearing House
Automated Payment System (CHAPS). A
third covers bulk electronic clearing for
standing orders and direct debits. A total of 23
banks and building societies are members of
one or more clearing companies.
Trends in Financial Transactions
Recent major changes in the nature of
financial transactions have included the rapid
growth in the use of plastic cards (which first
appeared in 1966) and of automated teller
machines (ATMs). There are 104 million
plastic cards in circulation in the UK, and
84% of adults have one or more cards. Cash,
however, continues to be the most popular
form of payment in terms of the volume of
transactions—about two-thirds of payments
above £1 are made in cash. The use of
cheques has been declining during the 1990s
(see Table 30.3), as cards have increased in
popularity.
The installation of ATMs has greatly
improved consumers’ access to cash,
particularly outside bank opening hours; their
number has more than doubled in the last ten
years, to 23,200 at the end of 1997. All the
major retail banks and building societies
participate in nationwide networks of ATMs.
There were 1,750 million cash withdrawals
from ATMs in 1997, the average withdrawal
being £52.
Plastic Cards
The main types of plastic card are cheque
guarantee cards, debit cards, credit cards,
charge cards and cash cards. Individual cards
frequently cover more than one use, such as a
cheque guarantee and cash card. Cheque
guarantee cards entitle holders to cheque-

Invented by David Sadler, the Aardvark can clear a path,
10 feet wide and two-thirds of a mile long, in an hour.
It is armour-plated, has bullet-proof windows and detonates mines
by thrashing them with its chains. Well in excess of 100 Aardvarks
have been sold in 23 countries.

It also has a capability against fragmenting mines

and licensed for production by Pains Wessex.
SWORD and COIN
The Queen’s Sword: in a private ceremony in June 1998, Lieutenant Kate Babbington, from Devon,
was the first female Royal Navy cadet to be honoured with the Queen’s Sword.
This prestigious annual award is given to the full- or medium-career officer
of either the Seaman or Supply specialisation who achieves the highest overall standard in training.
£2 coin: the first base metal £2 coin for general circulation in the United Kingdom
was issued in June 1998. The design, by Norfolk art teacher Bruce Rushin,

of differing alloys, and the first to incorporate a latent feature as a security device.
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
cashing facilities in participating institutions,
and guarantee retailers that transactions up to
a specified limit—typically £50 or £100—will
be honoured. Charge cards are similar to
credit cards, but are designed to be paid off in
full each month; they are usually available
only to those with relatively high incomes or
assets. Several major retailers issue store cards
for use within their own outlets.
Most credit cards are affiliated to one of the
two major international organisations, Visa
and MasterCard. There are around 38 million
credit cards (including charge cards) in use in
the UK, and 45% of adults hold a credit card.
Barclays is by far the largest issuer, with 6.5
million customers owning 9.4 million cards.
There are a growing number of ‘affinity’
cards, where the card is linked to an
organisation such as a charity or trade union.
The use of debit cards has increased rapidly
since their introduction in 1987. Some 64% of
adults in the UK hold a debit card, often
combined with cheque guarantee and ATM
facilities, and nearly 37 million have been
issued. Payments are deducted directly from
the purchaser’s current account. There are
four debit card schemes in operation: Switch,
Solo, Visa Delta and Visa Electron.
Following trials in Northampton and
Dunfermline, the major UK banks announced
in July 1998 that ‘smart’ cards, where
information is contained on a microchip
embedded in the card rather than in a
magnetic strip, would begin to replace the
current cards from 1999. Smart cards will
store much more information than is currently
possible and be able to combine several
functions; they are expected to offer greater
security. In a further measure designed to
reduce fraud, the Nationwide Building
Society began a six-month trial in April 1998
of the first ATM in the UK to use a scanner to
test a customer’s identity by comparing the
iris in his or her eye with a photograph.
Electronic Banking
Most banks and some of the larger building
societies offer home banking services, whereby
customers use a telephone to obtain account
information, make transfers and pay bills.
Some also have a home banking service for
customers via a personal computer and several
others are planning to introduce this type of
service. Other innovations include banking
services over the Internet and self-service
kiosks containing ATMs and video links to
banks’ central facilities.
New electronic purse cards are being
tested. Cards are ‘charged’ with money from
the card holder’s bank account, and can be
used to purchase goods or services at
participating retailers through electronic
tills.
National Savings
National Savings, an executive agency of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a source of
finance for government borrowing and aims
to encourage saving by offering personal
savers a range of investments. Its
headquarters is in London and its main
operating divisions are in Blackpool, Durham
and Glasgow. Certain National Savings
products provide tax-free returns. In April
1998 the total amount invested in National
Savings was £63,265 million. Sales of
National Savings products totalled £12,527
million in 1997-98. After allowing for
repayments, the net contribution to
government funding was £1,512 million. The
largest single contribution, £1,997 million,
came from Premium Bonds.
Other important products include:
• Savings Certificates, which pay either a
fixed rate of interest alone or a lower
fixed rate of interest combined with
index-linking (rising in line with the
Retail Prices Index);
• Income and Capital Bonds;
• Pensioners’ Bonds;
• Children’s Bonus Bonds, designed to
accumulate capital sums for those under
21;
• Ordinary and Investment Accounts,
where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at post offices throughout the UK;
and
• FIRST Option Bonds, which provide a
guaranteed rate of interest fixed for one
year.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial and insurance services, particularly
provision for retirement and against loss of
income through sickness or unemployment.
The Friendly Societies Act 1992 enabled
friendly societies to incorporate, take on new
powers and provide a larger variety of
financial services through subsidiaries. It also
established the Friendly Societies Commission
to administer a system of regulation and to
promote the financial stability of societies, of
which nearly 120 are authorised to accept new
business. By far the largest is Liverpool
Victoria, which has over 1 million members
and manages some £3,300 million of funds.
Other big societies include Royal Liver
Assurance, Family Assurance, Police Mutual
Assurance, Homeowners Friendly, and
Tunbridge Wells Equitable.
Special Financing Institutions
Several specialised institutions offer finance
and support to personal and corporate sector
borrowers:
• Finance houses and leasing companies
provide consumer credit, business
finance and leasing, and motor finance.
The 102 full members of the Finance and
Leasing Association undertook new
business worth £57,000 million in 1997.
• Credit unions—non-profit-making
savings and loans bodies—are less
widespread in the UK than in some other
countries. However, they have grown
rapidly during the 1990s, and are
particularly strong in Northern Ireland.
There are now nearly 770 credit unions
in the UK, with a membership of about
475,000 and total share capital of £376
million. In July 1998 the Government set
up a taskforce to encourage the expansion
of credit unions in Great Britain,
examine ways of widening the range of
services, and explore ways in which
banks and building societies can work
more closely with credit unions to
increase the latter’s effectiveness.
• Factoring comprises a range of financial
services, including credit management
and finance in exchange for outstanding
invoices not yet paid. During the 1990s
the factoring and discounting industry
has been growing at about 20% a year.
The industry provides working capital to
more than 22,000 businesses a year.
Member companies of the Factors &
Discounters Association handled
business worth £50,000 million in 1997.
• Venture capital companies offer medium-
and long-term equity financing for new
and developing businesses, management
buy-outs and buy-ins, and company
rescues. The UK sector is the largest and
most developed in Europe (see p. 433).
INSURANCE
London is one of the world’s leading centres
for insurance and international reinsurance. It
handles an estimated 20% of the general
insurance business placed on the international
market. As well as UK companies and the
Lloyd’s market (see below), many overseas
firms are represented, with which UK
companies have formed close relationships.
Main Types of Insurance
There are two broad categories of insurance:
long-term (such as life insurance), where
contracts may be for periods of many years;
and general, where contracts are for a year or
less. Most insurance companies reinsure their
risks; this performs an important function in
spreading losses and in helping insurance
companies to manage their businesses.
Long-term Insurance
Around 220 companies handle long-term
insurance. In addition to providing life cover,
life insurance is a vehicle for saving and
investment as premiums are invested in
securities and other assets. About 65% of
households have life insurance cover. Total
long-term insurance assets under management
by companies in 1997 were £601,025 million
on behalf of their worldwide operations.

FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by underwriters at
Lloyd’s. It includes fire, accident, general
liability, motor, marine, aviation and transport
risks. Total worldwide premium income of
members of the Association of British Insurers
(ABI) in 1997 was £35,330 million, of which
£22,734 million was earned in the UK.
Structure of the Industry
At the end of 1997, over 800 companies were
authorised to carry on one or more classes of
insurance business in the UK. Around 450
companies belong to the ABI.
The industry includes both public limited
companies and mutual institutions—
companies owned by their policyholders.
Among the biggest insurance companies are
Prudential, Standard Life (the largest mutual
insurer in Europe), Royal & SunAlliance, and
Norwich Union.
The industry is undergoing a period of
rapid change. Competition has intensified
in areas like motor and household
insurance, with the growth of telephone-
based operations, such as Direct Line
(which is now the largest insurer of private
motor vehicles in the UK). Commercial
Union and General Accident, two of the
largest companies, merged in 1998 to form
CGU, which has become the second
biggest insurer in the UK.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the
17th century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. It is not a
company but a market for insurance
administered by the Council of Lloyd’s and
Lloyd’s Regulatory and Market Boards.
The premium income of the market in 1997
was approximately £7,000 million. For 1998
the market has a total capacity of £10,200
million, which is provided by around 6,820
individual members and 435 corporate
members who underwrite through 155
syndicates. Each syndicate is managed by an
underwriting agent responsible for appointing
a professional underwriter to accept insurance
risks and manage claims on behalf of the
members of the syndicate. With the exception
of motor business, insurance may only be
placed through the 201 Lloyd’s-registered
broking companies, which negotiate with
Lloyd’s syndicates on behalf of the insured.
Reinsurance constitutes a large part of Lloyd’s
business—more than 5% of the world’s
reinsurance is placed at Lloyd’s. Around one-
sixth of Lloyd’s current work is in its
traditional marine market, and it also has a
significant share of the UK motor insurance
market, insuring about 15% of British
motorists. Lloyd’s is also a major insurer of
aviation and satellite risks, and underwrites in
all other areas of insurance.
Corporate members with limited liability
are contributing a growing proportion of the
market’s capacity, providing £6,100 million
for 1998. The number of individual
‘Names’—wealthy individuals who accept
insurance risks for their own profit or loss,
with unlimited liability—has fallen
substantially. Lloyd’s is strengthening the
financial requirements on all members in
order to increase the security of the market
and enhance the confidence of policyholders.
Institute of London Underwriters
The Institute of London Underwriters,
formed in 1884 as a trade association for
marine underwriters, provides a market where
member insurance companies transact marine,
energy, commercial transport and aviation
business. It issues combined policies in its own
name on risks underwritten by member
companies. Gross premium income processed
by the Institute for its 46 member companies
in 1997 was £1,184 million.
Insurance Brokers and Intermediaries
Insurance brokers, who act on behalf of the
insured, are a valuable part of the market.
Smaller brokers deal mainly with the general
public or specialise in a particular type of
commercial insurance. Medium to large
519
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
brokers almost exclusively handle commercial
matters, with the biggest dealing in worldwide
risks. Some brokers specialise in reinsurance
business, transferring all or part of an insurer’s
risk to a reinsurer. A statutory regime of
professional standards currently governs the
registration and regulation of individuals and
firms who use the title ‘insurance broker’. In
July 1998 the Government announced that
this regime would be abolished. For
intermediaries arranging general insurance
business, it is expected to be succeeded by a
self-regulating regime. For intermediaries
arranging life insurance constituting an
investment (such as a personal pension),
regulation will be by the FSA.
Some 16,000 individual insurance brokers
are currently registered, the majority of whom
are employed by about 2,000 limited
companies. Nearly 2,000 individuals carry on
business in their own right. A further 6,000
independent intermediaries operating under
the ABI’s code of practice may also arrange
insurance, but are currently not allowed to use
the title ‘insurance broker’.
INVESTMENT
The UK has considerable expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on behalf of investors, or advising them how
best to invest their funds. The industry is
estimated to contribute £2,700 million a year
to GDP and to generate £425 million in
overseas earnings. London is the largest fund
management centre in the world. The main
types of investment fund include pension
schemes, life assurance, unit trusts,
investment trusts and new open-ended
investment companies.
Pension Funds
Pension funds are major investors in securities
markets, holding around 30% of securities
listed on the London Stock Exchange. Total
net assets of UK pension funds were worth
about £616,000 million at the end of 1997.
Funds are managed mainly by the investment
management houses. Among the largest are
Mercury Asset Management, Phillips &
Drew, Schroders and Gartmore.
Unit Trusts
Over 1,700 authorised unit trusts and open-
ended investment companies (oeics) pool
investors’ money, and divide funds into units
or shares of equal size, enabling people with
relatively small amounts of money to benefit
from diversified and managed portfolios. The
industry has grown rapidly during the last
decade, and in the five years to 1998 total
funds under management have doubled, to
around £187,200 million. Some are general
funds, investing in a wide variety of UK or
international securities, and there are also
many specialist funds.
Over 50 unit trust management groups
have total fund values of more than £ 1,000
million. The largest is Schroder Unit Trusts
Ltd, which manages 38 funds, with a total
fund value of £15,278 million in June 1998.
Unit trust management groups are
represented by the Association of Unit Trusts
and Investment Funds.
Oeics, which became available in 1997, are
similar to unit trusts, but an investor in an oeic
buys shares in the fund rather than units. The
new schemes are designed to enable UK
companies to compete on an equal footing
with similar schemes operating elsewhere in
the EU. By June 1998, 72 oeics had been set
up by nine management groups, while a
number of other groups are examining the
possibility of converting some or all of their
unit trust funds to oeics.
Investment Trusts
Investment trust companies, which also offer
the opportunity to diversify risk on a relatively
small lump-sum investment or through
regular savings, are listed on the London
Stock Exchange and their shares are traded in
the usual way. They must invest principally in
securities, and the trusts themselves are
exempt from tax on gains realised within the
funds. Assets are purchased mainly out of
shareholders’ funds, although trusts are also
allowed to borrow money for investment.
There were 306 members of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies in June 1998,
with £64,400 million of assets under
management. The three largest trusts are the
520
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
venture capital company 3i Group, Foreign
& Colonial Investment Trust, and Alliance
Trust.
Share Ownership
In the last 30 years a notable feature of the
pattern of share ownership has been the
growth in the proportion held by financial
institutions^—including pension funds and
insurance companies—and a decline in the
proportion held by individuals. However, in
recent years the number of individual
shareholders has grown significantly. Recent
research conducted for the London Stock
Exchange and ProShare (an independent
organisation encouraging share ownership)
showed that there were an estimated 12
million shareholders in the UK. The value of
shares held by individuals in the UK is higher
than in other European countries.
The largest contribution to rising
individual share ownership was the
demutualisation in 1997 of five building
societies and the Norwich Union insurance
company, when about 16 million members
received shares, many in more than one
institution. Privatisation (see p. 434),
employee share schemes and Personal Equity
Plans have also led to increased share
ownership. The number of investment
clubs—groups of individuals, usually about
15 to 20 people, who regularly invest in
shares—has risen to around 3,000.
Personal Equity Plans (PEPs)
PEPs allow tax-free investment in shares,
including investment trust companies, in unit
trusts, and in certain corporate bonds (except
those issued by financial services companies),
preference shares and ‘convertibles’ (bonds or
preference shares which can eventually be
converted into a company’s ordinary shares).
Up to £6,000 in a single tax year may be
invested in a general PEP and up to £3,000 in
a single company PEP. Dividends and capital
gains on assets held in a PEP are exempt from
income tax and capital gains tax.
Since their introduction in 1987, more than
£53,000 million had been invested in over
15.5 million PEPs by April 1998—over 4
million people hold PEPs. Investments in
PEPs can be made until April 1999, when the
new individual savings accounts (see p. 394)
will become available for tax-free saving.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
The City of London’s financial markets
include the London Stock Exchange, the
foreign exchange market, the financial futures
and options market, Eurobond and
Eurocurrency markets, Lloyd’s insurance
market (see p. 519), and bullion and
commodity markets.
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange plays a vital role
in maintaining London’s position as a major
financial centre. It is one of the top three global
exchanges. The Exchange is based in London,
with representatives throughout the UK.
At the end of 1997, 2,157 UK and 526
international companies were listed on the
main market, with a market capitalisation of
£1,251,400 million and £2,429,100 million
respectively. The value and volume of equity
business on the Exchange rose to record levels
in 1997, with turnover in UK equities up by
37% compared with 1996, to £1,012,500
million, and turnover in international equities
rising by 39% to £1,443,200 million.
Following the ‘Big Bang’ series of reforms
of 1986, the Exchange has altered
considerably. The most fundamental change
has been the move away from the traditional
market floor to screen-based trading. In 1997
the Exchange introduced an electronic order
book, through which share transactions
between buyers and sellers are matched
automatically, rather than being passed
through market-making firms under the
‘quote-driven’ system. Currently, the new
system is limited to the largest UK shares.
AIM, the Alternative Investment Market,
was established by the Exchange in 1995, for
small, young and growing companies wishing
to raise capital and increase their profile. Over
310 companies, with a total capitalisation
exceeding £5,000 million, have joined AIM,
raising more than £2,000 million.
521
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
CREST, a new computerised settlement
system for shares and other company
securities, now handles the settlement of all
company securities traded in the UK. It is
owned and operated by CRESTCo, a private
sector consortium representing a wide spread
of City interests.
The gilts market (see p. 393) allows the
Government to raise money by issuing gilt-
edged stock. The London Stock Exchange
provides a secondary or trading market where
investors can buy or sell gilts. Turnover in the
market in 1997 was £1,012,535 million.
In July 1998 the London Stock Exchange
and the Deutsche Borse of Frankfurt, the
two leading exchanges in Europe, agreed to
form a strategic alliance, under which they
will explore the possible harmonisation of
the markets for their leading securities and,
in the long term, develop a joint electronic
trading platform. The aim is to create the
nucleus of a pan-European market,
covering some 300 ‘blue chip’ equities.
Euromarket
The Euromarket began with Eurodollars—US
dollars lent outside the United States—and
has developed into a major market in a variety
of currencies lent outside their domestic
markets. An increasing volume of issuing and
trading activity is conducted, much of it in the
UK. London is at the centre of the
Euromarket and houses most of the leading
international banks and securities firms.
London’s share of trading in the two main
types of international bonds—Eurobonds and
foreign bonds—is around 70% of the market
of about £8,450,000 million in 1997.
The euro-securities markets have grown
considerably in recent years because the
instruments traded on them—including
Eurobonds, euro-medium-term notes
(EMTNs) and euro-commercial paper—are
seen as flexible alternatives to bank loans.
Money Markets
London’s money markets channel wholesale
short-term funds between lenders and
borrowers. They comprise the interbank
deposit markets plus a range of other
instruments, usually short term in maturity.
Negotiations are mostly conducted by
telephone or via automated dealing systems.
Foreign Exchange Market
London is the world’s biggest centre for
foreign exchange trading, accounting for about
32% of global net daily turnover in foreign
exchange. A survey by the Bank of England in
April 1998 found that daily turnover in the
UK was US $637,000 million, 37% up since
the previous survey in 1995. Dealing is now
conducted entirely through telephone and
electronic links between the banks, other
financial institutions and a number of firms of
foreign exchange brokers which act as
intermediaries. The institutions keep close
contact with financial centres abroad and
quote buying and selling rates throughout the
day for both immediate (‘spot’) and forward
transactions in many currencies. Turnover is
increasingly in forward rather than spot
transactions.
Financial Futures and Options
Financial derivatives, including ‘futures’ and
‘options’, offer a means of protection against
changes in prices, exchange rates and interest
rates. ‘Futures’ are contracts to deliver or
take delivery of financial instruments or
physical commodities at a future date, while
‘options’ give the right but not the obligation
to buy or sell financial instruments or
physical commodities on a stated date at a
predetermined price. Commodity and
financial futures and options are traded at the
London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (LIFFE).
LIFFE has 235 members, including many
of the world’s leading financial institutions.
Its trading floor in the City contains ‘open
outcry’ trading facilities, with members
executing their business through a system of
hand signals and shouting on the trading
floor. In 1998 LIFFE announced plans to
introduce an electronic trading system by
mid-1999.
522
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
LIFFE’s share of the world’s futures and
options trades has more than doubled since
1988, to around 19% in 1997. A record
209 million futures and options contracts
were traded in 1997, 25% higher than in
1996. This represented an average daily
volume of 828,000 contracts, with a
nominal average daily value of £178,800
million. In 1996 LIFFE merged with the
London Commodity Exchange, where
trading includes contracts in coffee, cocoa,
sugar, grain, potatoes and the dry freight
index. In 1997, the first full year of
trading, a new commodity trading record
was set, of 4.5 million contracts.
Other Markets
Among the other important City markets are:
• the London bullion market—around 60
banks and other financial trading
companies participate in the London
gold and silver markets;
• the London Metal Exchange—the primary
base metals market in the world, trading
contracts in aluminium, aluminium alloy,
copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc;
• the International Petroleum Exchange—
Europe’s only energy futures exchange;
• the Baltic Exchange—the world’s leading
international shipping market.
Other Services
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale is a major
economic activity. The large wholesalers and
retailers of food and drink operate extensive
distribution networks, either directly or
through contractors.
Wholesaling
In 1996 there were 110,107 businesses, with a
turnover of £343,848 million (see Table 30.4),
engaged in wholesaling and dealing in Great
Britain.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Many small
wholesalers and independent grocery retailers
belong to voluntary ‘symbol’ groups (for
example, Spar, Landmark and Londis), which
provide access to central purchasing facilities
and co-ordinated promotions. This has helped
smaller retailers to remain relatively
competitive; many local and convenience
stores and village shops would not otherwise
be able to stay in business. Booker, Batleys
and Bestways are the major ‘cash and carry’
wholesalers, which have become increasingly
important. Palmer and Harvey McLane and
Booker Foodservice are the principal food
services delivery wholesalers. London’s
wholesale markets play a significant part in the
distribution of fresh foodstuffs. New Covent
Garden is the main market for fruit and
vegetables, Smithfield for meat and
Billingsgate for fish.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society
(CWS) is the principal supplier of goods and
services to the Co-operative Movement and
was a founder member of the Co-operative
Retail Trading Group. Formed in 1993 to act
as a central marketing, buying and distribution
partnership for retail co-operative societies,
the Group now accounts for around 60% of
Co-op food trade. The CWS is also the largest
co-operative retailer in Europe, with 635
stores located in Scotland, Northern Ireland,
the east and south Midlands, and south-east
and north-east England. Retail co-operative
societies are voluntary organisations controlled
by their members, membership being open to
anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum
share. Throughout the Co-operative
Movement, which comprises 47 independent
societies, there are nearly 2,300 stores.
Retailing
The retail sector accounts for almost two-
fifths of all consumer expenditure. In 1996
there were 207,000 retail businesses, with
320,600 outlets, in Great Britain (see Table
30.5). Their annual turnover was £193,236
million, of which retail turnover represented
£181,538 million. Businesses range from
national supermarket and other retail chains to
independent corner grocery shops, hardware
stores, chemists, newsagents and a host of

other types of retailer. During recent years the
large multiple retailers have grown
considerably, tending to increase outlet size
and diversify product ranges. Some, such as
Marks & Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Tesco,
also operate overseas, through either
subsidiaries or franchise agreements. Small
independent retail businesses and co-operative
societies have been in decline for some time.
Sunday trading laws have been relaxed to
allow retailers to open for specified periods on
Sundays; smaller retailers are permitted to
open on Sundays for longer hours than the
larger supermarkets and department stores, to
help their competitive position. The main
supermarket chains are experimenting with
24-hour opening on selected days. They are
also looking closely at different forms of home
shopping (by phone, fax and Internet) and
delivery. Iceland has already started home
deliveries.
The biggest supermarket groups by sales
value are Tesco (with about 570 UK stores),
J. Sainsbury (404, including 13 Savacentre
524
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
stores), Asda (215), Safeway (490), and the
recently merged Somerfield/Kwik Save
(1,460). They account for around two-thirds
of total grocery sales, including over 45% of
UK food sales—in July 1998 the Office of
Fair Trading (see p. 435) announced an
inquiry into the dominant position of the
four biggest groups in the market. Other
large food retailers include Marks &
Spencer, Morrisons, Waitrose and Iceland.
Alcoholic drinks are sold mainly in specialist
‘off licences’ and supermarkets. The
principal off-licence specialists are
Threshers, Victoria Wine, Greenalls Cellars,
Unwins and Oddbins.
The leading mixed retail chains are found
in high streets nationwide. Among them are
Marks & Spencer (mainly selling clothing and
food and drink), Boots (pharmaceuticals and
cosmetic goods), F. W. Woolworth (a variety
of products, from clothing to kitchenware),
W. H. Smith (newspapers, books and
stationery), Great Universal Stores and its
recently acquired subsidiary Argos (which
keeps in stock an extensive range of goods
ordered in the stores from a catalogue and
then taken away by customers), Dixons
(consumer electronics), Next (clothing) and
John Lewis and Debenhams (a variety of
wares, including clothing, furniture and
electrical goods). Several chains of DIY (Do-
It-Yourself) stores and superstores cater for
people carrying out their own repairs and
improvements to their homes and gardens;
they stock tools, decorating and building
materials, kitchen and bathroom fittings, and
garden products. The three biggest are B&Q,
J. Sainsbury’s Homebase and Wickes.
Kingfisher has announced its intention to
merge its B&Q^business with that of
Castorama of France in a joint venture which
would be the largest DIY retailer in Europe.
The large multiple groups have broadened
their range of goods and services. For
example, large food retailers are increasing
their choice of provisions and placing greater
emphasis on selling own-label goods (which
now account for over half of sales) and
environmentally friendly products (including
organic produce), together with household
wares and clothing. Many sell fresh food, such
as meat, fish, vegetables and, in some cases,
bread baked on the premises. In-store
pharmacies, post offices, customer cafeterias
and dry-cleaners are now a feature of large
supermarkets, which have also begun selling
books, magazines, newspapers, pre-recorded
videos, cassettes and compact discs. ‘Stores
within stores’ are common; for example,
sportswear and sports goods retailers are to be
found in several of the big mixed department
stores. The major supermarket chains have
their own petrol stations at some of their
bigger outlets (see p. 526). Several large
retailers now offer personal finance facilities in
an attempt to encourage sales, particularly of
high-value goods, while others, including
Marks & Spencer and Boots, are diversifying
into financial services. ‘Loyalty’ cards have
been introduced by supermarket and other
retail groups, giving regular customers cash
discounts related to the size of their purchases
and providing the stores with detailed
information on shoppers’ buying habits.
Nearly 570 franchisers, with 29,100 outlets
and yearly sales of £7,000 million, operate in
retailing (and other sectors). Franchising is a
business in which a company owning the
rights to a particular form of trading licenses
them to franchisees, usually by means of an
initial payment with continuing royalties.
Franchised activities operate in many areas,
including cleaning services, film processing,
print shops, fitness centres, courier delivery,
car rental, engine tuning and servicing, and
fast food retailing. Among the large-scale
franchise operations are Greenall’s ‘themed’
public houses, McDonald’s, KallKwik (fast
printing) and Alldays convenience stores.
About 200 franchisers are members of the
British Franchise Association.
In 1997, 700,000 people were employed in
Great Britain in retailing motor vehicles and
parts, and in petrol stations. Many businesses
selling new vehicles are franchised by the
motor manufacturers. Vehicle components are
available for sale at garages which undertake
servicing and repair work and also at retail
chains like Flalfords and at independent
retailers. Drive-in fitting centres sell tyres,
exhaust systems, batteries, clutches and other
vehicle parts; the largest chains include Kwik-
Fit and ATS. There are about 14,800 retail
outlets for petrol; the three companies with
525
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the highest number are Esso, BP and Shell.
Around 70% of petrol stations are self-service.
The number of petrol stations has been
reduced by about 27% in the last decade,
reflecting intense competition in the sector,
relatively low profit margins and consolidation
among operators. Petrol stations are
increasingly offering other retail services, such
as shops, car washes and fast food outlets, with
the aim of attracting more business. Over one-
fifth of petrol sold in the UK comes from
supermarket forecourts.
All kinds of goods and services can be
purchased through mail order catalogues from
such firms as Empire, Freeman’s, Grattan and
Littlewoods. In 1997 sales by general mail
order totalled £6,800 million. The largest
selling items are clothing, footwear, furniture,
household textiles and domestic electrical
appliances.
Shopping Facilities
Government policy is to focus new retail
development in existing centres. This is to
ensure that everyone has easy access to a range
of shops and services, whether they have a car
or not; and to enable businesses of all sizes and
types to prosper. The Government aims to
help revitalise shopping and other facilities in
town centres. One of the most significant
trends in retailing has been the spread of
superstores, many of which have been built
away from urban centres until recently. They
are located on sites offering good road access
and ample parking facilities. About half of
total food sales are now accounted for by
superstores away from town centres,
compared with a fifth at the beginning of the
1980s.
Since 1996, social, economic and
environmental considerations have led the
Government to advise local planning
authorities to limit large-scale new retail
developments outside town centres, which
have undermined the viability of existing
small town and district centres, encroached on
the countryside and encouraged greater car
use. All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local planning
authority, which must consult central
government before granting permission for
developments of 20,000 sq m (215,000 sq ft) or
more. Encouraged by the Government, the
main multiple grocery companies are turning
their attention back to town centres,
redeveloping existing stores and building
smaller outlets. Examples include Tesco’s
‘Metro’ format and J. Sainsbury’s ‘Central’
and ‘Local’ stores.
One of the first large regional out-of-town
shopping centres was the Metro Centre at
Gateshead in north-east England, which has
350 shops and attracted nearly 30 million
shoppers in 1997. Other major centres include
Merry Hill at Dudley in the West Midlands
(one of the UK’s largest indoor shopping
centres), Meadowhall in Sheffield and the
Lakeside Centre at Thurrock in Essex. The
Trafford Centre, built on the outskirts of
Manchester and opened in September 1998,
contains 280 shops, 25 restaurants and a
leisure complex. Another new shopping and
leisure centre is being built at Bluewater Park
near Dartford in Kent and is due to open in
March 1999; when completed it will be the
largest shopping centre in Europe.
Retailers of non-food goods, such as DIY
products, toys, furniture and electrical
appliances, sportswear, and office and
computer products, have also built outlets
away from urban centres. There is a
continuing trend towards grouping retail
warehouses into retail parks, often with food
and other facilities, although planning controls
are limiting approvals for new parks.
Information Technology
Computers monitor stock levels and record
sales figures through electronic point-of-sale
(EPOS) systems. EPOS systems read a bar¬
code printed on the retail item that holds price
and product information and can be used to
generate orders for stock replenishment as
well as totalling up bills and providing a
receipt for customers. Techniques such as
‘just-in-time’ ordering, in which products
arrive at the store at the last possible moment
before sale, have become widespread as a
result. Leading retailers have set up electronic
data interchange (EDI) systems; these enable
their computers to communicate with those of
their suppliers, and transmit orders and
526
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
invoices electronically, so reducing errors and
saving time.
‘Superscan’ technology—where customers
use an electronic scanning device to work out
their own bills, thus avoiding the need to
queue at a check-out—is undergoing trials in a
number of supermarkets. Electronic home
shopping, using a television and telephone,
and ‘online’ shopping, where personal
computers are linked to databases, are also
being introduced.
Hotels and Catering
The hotel and restaurant trades, which
include public houses (pubs), wine bars and
other licensed bars in addition to all kinds of
businesses offering accommodation and
prepared food, employed 1.3 million people in
the UK in 1997 and their total turnover was
about £44,000 million. There are about 12,700
hotels and motels in the UK. The largest
business is Forte Hotels, owned by Granada
Group, with 284 hotels in the UK. At the
other end of the scale, numerous guest houses
and hotels (many individually owned) have
fewer than 20 rooms. Holiday centres,
including holiday camps with full board, self¬
catering centres and caravan parks, are run by
Butlins, Holiday Club, Center Parcs, Warner
Holidays and Pontin’s, among others.
In 1996 there were around 46,000
restaurants, cafes and take-away food shops in
the UK, with a total turnover of £12,067
million. Restaurants offer cuisine from
virtually every country in the world; they cater
for the whole spread of income groups and
several of the highest quality ones have
international reputations. Chinese, Indian,
Thai, Italian, French and Greek restaurants
are among the most popular. ‘Fast food’
restaurants are widespread, many of which are
franchised. They specialise in selling
hamburgers, chicken, pizza and a variety of
other foods, to be eaten on the premises or
taken away. Well-known nationwide chains
include McDonald’s (hamburgers), Burger
King (hamburgers), KFC (chicken), Pizza
Hut and Pizza Express. Traditional fish and
chip shops are another main provider of
cooked take-away food. Sandwich bars are
common in towns and cities, typically in areas
with high concentrations of office workers. In
1996 sandwiches accounted for 34% of the fast
food market, hamburgers 22%, fish and chips
13%, pizzas 11%, ethnic food (Chinese and
Indian) 11% and chicken 6%.
About 49,500 pubs sell beer, wines, soft
drinks and spirits to adults for consumption
on the premises, and most also serve hot and
cold food. Many pubs are owned by the large
brewing companies, which either provide
managers to run them or offer tenancy
agreements; these pubs tend to sell just their
own brands of beer, although some also offer
‘guest’ beers. Others, called ‘free houses’, are
independently owned and managed and
frequently serve a variety of different branded
beers. Wine bars are normally smaller than
pubs and tend to specialise in wine and food;
they more closely resemble bars in other parts
of Europe. ‘Themed’ pubs, for example Irish
bars, are becoming increasingly popular.
Travel Agents
Most British holiday-makers travelling overseas
buy ‘package holidays’ from travel agencies,
where the cost covers both transport and
accommodation. The most popular package
holiday destinations are Spain and France.
Long-haul holidays to places like the United
States, the Caribbean and Australia have gained
in popularity as air fares have come down. Some
people prefer to travel more independently, and
there are travel firms which will make just travel
arrangements for customers.
Around 95% of high street travel agencies
are members of the Association of British
Travel Agents (ABTA). Although most are
small businesses, a few large firms, such as
Lunn Poly and Thomas Cook, have hundreds
of branches. Some 600 tour operators are
members of ABTA; about half are both retail
agents and tour operators. Major tour
operators include Thomson, Airtours and
First Choice. ABTA operates financial
protection schemes to safeguard its members’
customers and maintains codes of conduct
drawn up with the Office of Fair Trading. It
also offers a free consumer affairs service to
help resolve complaints against members, and
a low-cost independent arbitration scheme for
members’ customers. The British Incoming

Tourism and Leisure
Tourism is one of the UK’s key growth sectors,
with total spending on tourism in 1997
estimated at £53,000 million. In the region of
1.7 million people are employed in tourism and
related activities; of these, around 194,000 are
self-employed. Over 124,000 businesses,
mainly independent small ones—hotels and
guesthouses, restaurants, holiday homes,
caravan and camping parks and so on—are
responsible for providing the bulk of tourism
services; about 8% of small businesses are
engaged in tourism.
The UK’s share of world tourism earnings
reached 4.7% in 1997. While more than 53% of
overseas tourists spend all or most of their visit
in London, others venture further afield to see
the many attractions in the English regions as
well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Channel Tunnel has improved access to
many UK tourist attractions for people
travelling from continental Europe. It is one of
the reasons France has become the country
sending the largest number of overseas tourists
to the UK (see box).
Domestic tourism generated approximately
£24,100 million in 1996. Of British residents
opting to take their main holiday in the UK,
25% choose a traditional seaside destination,
such as Blackpool (Lancashire), Bournemouth
(Dorset), Great Yarmouth (Norfolk) and
resorts in Devon and Cornwall. Short holiday
breaks (one to three nights), valued at £2,600
million in 1996, make up an increasingly
significant part of the market.
The UK’s historic towns and cities and its
scenic rural and coastal areas continue to have
great appeal for British and overseas tourists
alike. There is a growing interest in heritage,
arts and culture; attractions include museums,
art galleries, historic buildings and monuments,
and theatres, as well as shopping, sports and
business facilities. Domestic and foreign
tourists play an increasingly important role in
supporting the UK’s national heritage and
creative arts, in addition to the large financial
contribution they make to hotels, restaurants,
The number of overseas visitors coming to
the UK has more than doubled in the last
20 years. In 1997 a record 26 million—
3.5% more than in 1996—spent almost
£12,650 million. An estimated 65% were
from Western Europe (the highest
proportion, 23%, were from France) and
16% from North America. Business travel
accounts for about £3,700 million, 29% of
all overseas tourism revenue. London’s
Heathrow and Gatwick airports, the
seaport of Dover and the Channel Tunnel
are the main points of entry.
cafes and bars, and public transport. Since
opening to visitors for the two months of July
and August 1998, around 150,000 people have
been to view the final resting place of Diana,
Princess of Wales, at Althorp in
N orthamptonshire.
Business travel accounts for a growing share
of the tourism market; it includes attendance at
conferences, exhibitions, trade fairs and other
business sites. Activity holidays—based on
walking, canoeing, mountain climbing, or
artistic activities, for example—are becoming
more popular. The Youth Hostel Association
operates a comprehensive network of hostels
offering young people and families a range of
affordable facilities, including self-catering.
‘Leisure parks’ attract nearly 40 million
visitors a year. Alton Towers (Staffordshire),
Chessington World of Adventures and Thorpe
Park (both in Surrey) are three of the biggest;
2.7 million people visited Alton Towers in 1997
and 1.7 million visited Chessington World of
Adventures (see Table 30.6). Legoland near
Windsor in Berkshire is the newest such park;
it attracted 1.3 million visitors in 1997.
Attractions in these parks include spectacular
‘white knuckle’ rides and overhead cable cars
and railways, while some parks also feature
domesticated and wild animals. A new large
theme park is planned near Newport in south
Wales.

and the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland
Offices have responsibility for tourism in their
respective countries. The government-
supported British Tourist Authority (BTA)
promotes the UK overseas as a tourist
destination through 43 offices in 36 countries
and encourages the development of tourist
facilities in the UK to meet the needs of
overseas visitors. The tourist boards for
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, which also receive government
finance, support domestic tourism and work
with the BTA to promote the UK overseas.
The Government is consulting on proposals to
replace the English Tourist Board by
alternative means of support for domestic
tourism in England.
The Government is working with the
tourism industry to raise standards of
accommodation and service, and to address
certain key issues facing the industry. These
include its communications strategy;
improving visitor attractions; boosting
business tourism; encouraging best practice
for the development of workforce skills; and
government-industry communication. The
Government is also considering how best to
support tourism growth which is
economically, socially and environmentally
sustainable. The BTA and the national tourist
boards inform and advise the Government on
issues of concern to the industry. They also
help businesses and other organisations to
plan by researching and publicising trends
affecting the industry. The national tourist
boards work closely with regional tourist
boards, on which local government and
business interests are represented. There are
about 800 local Tourist Information Centres
in the UK. Accommodation classification and
quality grading schemes are operated by the
national tourist boards in conjunction with
motoring organisations such as the AA and
RAC.
Exhibition and Conference Centres
The UK is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences—the
others being the United States and France.
London and Paris are the two most popular
conference cities. Other British towns and
cities—including several traditional seaside
holiday resorts diversifying to take advantage
of the growing business tourism market—have
conference and exhibition facilities.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre in
Birmingham; the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in
London; and Cardiff International Arena, a
5,000-seat multi-purpose facility. In Scotland,
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen have
529
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
major exhibition and conference centres. The
£29 million Belfast Waterfront Hall opened in
1997. Brighton (East Sussex), Harrogate
(North Yorkshire), Bournemouth (Dorset),
Manchester, Nottingham and Torquay
(Devon) all have exhibition and conference
centres. Other important exhibition facilities
are in London, at the Barbican, Earls Court,
Alexandra Palace and Wembley Arena.
The UK’s largest exhibition halls are at
the National Exhibition Centre
(Birmingham), where a new extension was
opened in September 1998. The Centre
now has a total of 190,000 sq m of
exhibition space in 20 halls.
Rental Services
A varied range of rental services, many
franchised, are available throughout the UK.
These include hire of cars and other vehicles;
televisions, video recorders and camcorders;
household appliances such as washing
machines; tools and heavy decorating
equipment (such as ladders and floor sanders);
and video films and computer games.
Retailing of many types of service is
dominated by chains, although independent
operators are still to be found in most fields.
In addition, there is a thriving sector renting
to businesses—all sorts of machinery and
other types of equipment, together with
computers and other office appliances. In 1997
turnover of the rental sector amounted to
£13,061 million.
sector amounted to nearly £23,000 million in
1997, 26% higher than in 1996.
British firms and universities have
established strong reputations in software
R&D. A number of international IT
conglomerates have set up R&D operations in
the UK—among them are Hitachi, IBM,
Nortel, Philips and Sharp. US software
company Computer Associates has announced
plans to build a new £100 million European
headquarters at Datchet, near Heathrow
Airport. Microsoft intends to make a major
R&D investment at Cambridge (see p. 412).
Academic expertise is especially evident in
such areas as artificial intelligence, neural
networks, formal programming for safety
critical systems, and parallel programming
systems. Software firms have developed
strengths in sector-specific applications,
including systems for retailing, banking,
finance and accounting, medical and dental
industries, and the travel and entertainment
industries. The market leader in the UK for
‘point-of-sale’ systems is ICL. Specialist
‘niche’ markets in which UK software
producers are active include artificial
intelligence, scientific and engineering
software (especially computer-aided design),
mathematical software, geographical
information systems, and data visualisation
packages. Some firms specialise in devising
multimedia software. Distance learning,
‘virtual reality’ and computer animation all
benefit from a large pool of creative talent.
One of the biggest users of software is the
telecommunications industry. The provision
of almost all new telecommunications services,
including switching and transmission, is
dependent on software.
Computing Services
The computing services industry comprises
businesses engaged in software development;
production of packaged software; consultancy;
information technology (IT) ‘outsourcing’;
processing services; and the provision of
complete computer systems. It also includes
companies that provide IT education and
training; independent maintenance; support,
contingency planning and recruitment; and
contract staff. Turnover of companies in this
Market Research
The UK’s market research profession has
developed strongly in the past decade or so,
and now accounts for around 9% of
worldwide turnover for market research. It has
a wide range of domestic and overseas clients,
including government bodies. UK firms range
in size from large firms with international
activities (such as Taylor Nelson, AGB, NOP
and BMRB) to a number of small
consultancies and sole practitioners.

FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Management Consultancy
The UK’s 35,000 management consultants
supply technical assistance and advice to
business and government clients. The 32
members of the Management Consultancies
Association account for more than half of
management consultancy work carried out in
the UK. The largest firms include Andersen
Consulting, CMG Management, CSC,
Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, KPMG,
PA Consulting, PricewaterhouseCoopers and
Serna. In 1997 member firms earned £2,230
million in the UK and £450 million abroad.
Advertising and Public Relations
The UK is a major centre for creative
advertising, and multinational corporations
often use advertising created in the UK for
marketing their products globally. British
agencies have strong foreign links through
overseas ownership and associate networks.
Advertising expenditure in the UK increased
by 9% to £13,000 million in 1997. The press
accounted for 53% of the total, television for
28%, direct mail for 12%, and posters,
transport, commercial radio and cinema for
the rest. The largest advertising expenditure is
on food, household durables, cosmetics, office
equipment, motor vehicles and financial
services. Among the biggest spenders in 1997
were BT, Dixons, Procter and Gamble,
Kellogg, Unilever, Cable & Wireless and the
major car manufacturers.
Campaigns are planned by around 1,000
advertising agencies. Leading agencies include
Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, J. Walter
Thompson, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Ogilvy and
Mather. In addition to their creative,
production and media buying roles, some
agencies offer integrated marketing services,
including consumer research and public
relations. Many agencies have sponsorship
departments, which arrange for businesses to
sponsor products and events, including
artistic, sporting and charitable events. In
return for financial or other support, the
sponsoring company is associated with a
worthy product or occasion, thereby raising its
profile with consumers.
Government advertising campaigns—on
crime prevention, health promotion, armed
services recruitment and so on—are often
organised by the Central Office of
Information, an executive agency of the
Government (see p. 537).
The UK’s public relations industry has
developed rapidly, and there are now many
small specialist firms. About 30% of the
earnings of UK public relations firms
represents overseas work.
Business Support Services
One of the major growth areas in the services
sector is in support services, reflecting the
trend by more and more firms to ‘outsource’
non-core operations. Initially, operating areas
which were outsourced or contracted out were
in cleaning, security and catering. However,
firms are now outsourcing other activities, such
as IT and personnel support services. A study
for the Department of Trade and Industry in
1996 found that the annual turnover of business
support services in the UK was around
£10,000 million, and the sector employed
675,000 people. Among the largest firms
providing these services are Rentokil Initial,
DCS Group, Hays and Serco Group.
