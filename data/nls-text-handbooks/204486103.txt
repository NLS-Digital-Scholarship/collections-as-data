Introduction
Britain 1975 is the twenty-sixth official handbook in the series prepared
and revised each year by Reference Division of the Central Office of
Information with the co-operation of other government departments and
of many national organisations. The handbook is widely known as an
established work of reference and is the mainstay of the reference facilities
provided by the British Information Services in many countries. It is avail¬
able overseas in a limited free edition and is on sale throughout the world.
This 1975 edition, which covers events up to September 1974, gives a
factual account of the administration and the national economy of Britain.
It describes the activities of many of the national institutions, both official
and unofficial, and shows the part played by the Government in the life of
the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain's participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to
Britain as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the
Annual Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued
by the Central Statistical Office, and also other government publications
and standard works of reference, some of which are listed in the biblio¬
graphy towards the end of the handbook.

1 The Land and the
People
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, formally known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, forms the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands lying off
the north-west coast of Europe. The largest islands are Great Britain (compris¬
ing the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland (comprising
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the southern coast of England
is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of Scilly; off
north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous islands and
to the far north are the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands. All
these have administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the
Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a
large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of England,
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
England has a total area (including inland water) of 50,335 square miles
(130,367 sq. km.); Wales has a total area of 8,016 square miles (20,763 sq. km.);
Scotland, including its inhabited islands has a total area of 30,414 square
miles (78,773 sq. km.); Northern Ireland has a total area of 5,452 square
miles (14,120 sq. km.). Together, these countries constitute the United King¬
dom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (or Britain), with a total area of
94,217 square miles (244,021 sq. km.). The total land area of the United King¬
dom (excluding inland water) is 93,026 square miles (240,936 sq. km.):
England, 50,053 (129,637); Wales 7,968 (20,638); Scotland 29,799 (77,179);
and Northern Ireland, 5,206 (13,483).
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together
for many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which com¬
prises England, Wales and Scotland, or to Britain (the United Kingdom) as
a whole. United Kingdom statistics and other data sometimes include the Isle
of Man, 227 square miles (588 sq. km.), and the Channel Islands, 75 square
miles (194 sq. km.), which strictly are not part of the United Kingdom but are
dependencies of the Crown.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost point
of Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 600 miles (966 km.) in a
straight line from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain and
about 300 miles (483 km.) across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous
bays and inlets no point in Britain is as much as 75 miles (121 km.) from tidal
water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually
Geology and
Topography
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
less than 50 fathoms (300 feet or 91 metres)—because the islands lie on the
continental shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor
plunges abruptly from 600 feet (183 metres) to 3,000 feet (914 metres). These
shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing grounds
as well as breeding grounds for fish. The North Atlantic Current, the drift
of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The
effect of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, lowland Britain and highland Britain.
In lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
(305 metres) above sea level. Its boundaries run roughly from the mouth of
the Tyne in the north-east to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet (305 metres). This high
ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologically the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old
rocks (archaean and palaeozoic), while the upper strata in the valleys and plains
are mainly more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern
and western parts of lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures
which were the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The outcrops
and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were found
on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of
the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age
during which, at one period or another, ice caps and ice sheets extended
approximately as far south as the Bristol Channel and the Thames valley. The
ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had
previously been formed, so that, when the ice eventually disappeared, the hills
stood out as barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders,
boulder-clay, sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the lower ground.
The ice had blocked up previous drainage channels and left large lakes, which
have since gradually dried up, leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often
affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by

Snowdon, 3,560 feet (1,085 metres); and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District,
Cumbria), 3,210 feet (978 metres).

the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses1 are irregu¬
larly placed around central lowlands; the rocks of Ireland are of the same types
as the highland zone of Great Britain, and in the higher parts the moorland
vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, parti¬
cularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of highland Britain often reach the
coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the coast of south-west Wales;
the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumbria coast; and the vertically
jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even
around lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft,
white limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white cliffs of Dover or
the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south¬
east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England
between the Humber and the Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying,
and for hundreds of years some stretches of it have been protected against the
sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of
the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the
short British rivers2 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the prevail¬
ing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled
mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which, moving in a
generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near the British
Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few extremes of
temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the eastern Atlantic,
occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring a cold, dry,
continental type of weather which, once established, may persist for many days
or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores high pressure system
usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards north-west Europe, and
the depressions take a more northerly course, often passing entirely to the
north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly direction the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-
westerlies although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the
spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may
differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography. Winds
are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British Isles, stronger
on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the east. The
strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at Lerwick,
Shetland Islands, varies from about 19 m.p.h. (31 km.p.h.) in January to about
14 m.p.h. (23 km.p.h.) in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western
outskirts of London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. (16

5
km.p.h.) in January to about 7 m.p.h. (n km.p.h.) in August. The stormiest
region is along the north-west coast with over 30 gales a year; south-east
England and the east Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on
about 2 days a year inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west of Britain the mean annual temperature ranges from
8°C. (47°F.) in the Hebrides to n0C. (52°F.) in the extreme south-west of
England; latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly
temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 4°C.
(39°F.) during the winter (December, January and February) to I2°C. (54°F.)
during the summer (June, July and August): the corresponding figures for the
Isle of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C. (4i°F.) and i6°C. (6i°F.). The
average range of temperature between winter and summer varies from 7°C. to
i2°C. (45°-540F.), being greatest inland in the eastern part of the country.
During a normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 27°C.
(8o°F.) in the south, but temperatures of 32°C. (9o°F.) and above are in¬
frequent. Extreme minimum temperatures depend largely on local conditions,
but —7°C. (20°F.) may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, — i2°C. (io°F.)
is rare, and — i8°C. (o°F.) or below has been recorded only during exception¬
ally cold periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches (1,016
mm.), while England alone has about 34 inches (854 mm.). The geographical
distribution of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure
to the Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more
rain than the lowland of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches (3,810
and 5,080 mm.) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during
the average year, whereas some places in the south-east of England record less
than 20 inches (508 mm.). Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year,
but, on the average, March to June are the driest months and October to
January the wettest. A period of as long as three weeks without rain is excep¬
tional, and is usually confined to limited areas. In successive years, however,
remarkably contrasting weather conditions are sometimes experienced.
The distribution of sunshine over Britain shows a general decrease from south
to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During
May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the mean daily duration
of sunshine varies from five hours in north-west Scotland to eight hours in the
Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—November, December
and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a
day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District
(Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe in recent years as a
result of changes in fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valleys and the plains where soils are deeper and richer;
villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole of
lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except
Fauna
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage
systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation
the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moor¬
land. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished
and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission
in the past 50 years, woodlands now occupy only about 8 per cent of the surface
of the country. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north and east
of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and on the Welsh border.
Yet much of Britain appears to be well wooded because of the numerous
hedgerows and isolated trees. The most common trees are oak, beech, ash and
elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which over a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied semi¬
natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or wire fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and the
even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry
up, grassland is green throughout the year with many wild flowers from spring
to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some flowers may
not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals, includ¬
ing the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct; but red
deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands and on
Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in Scotland
and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer (which are
probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are wild in
some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are foxes
in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers and streams. Both
common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of the coast, though not
usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles,
shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey more numerous than
the native red), hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or pass through, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, blackbird
and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate near
houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings which
congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species of birds
have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to their
success in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in London
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
7
there has been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result of the
improvement in the environment brought about by anti-pollution measures.
Some large birds, on the other hand, have tended to decrease, but several
species, such as the osprey and the ruff, have re-established themselves after
disappearing from Britain in the nineteenth century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravel pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found; salmon, trout, pike, roach,
dace and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an
introduced species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by
introductiona for angling purposes. In a number of rivers measures to control
pollution have resulted in fish becoming more numerous. In the Thames in
London, for example, where 66 species of fish have been found, conditions
are now thought to be suitable for salmon to enter the river.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly (3 to
4 inches or 8 to 10 cm.) and the stag beetle (2^ inches or 6 cm.). The insect
fauna in Britain is less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a
number of common European species. With modern methods of pest control,
extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases
spread by insect vectors are not common in Britain but there is some anxiety
among naturalists that chemical protection against insects may be reducing
the population of creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn.
These and other effects of agricultural chemicals on wild life are the subject of
special safeguards.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit Britain are descended mainly from the people
who inhabited the area nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were
the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
the French language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in
1066.
Obviously it is not possible to estimate the relative importance of various
early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen,
including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots, Welsh and
Irish. It is significant, however, that over most of England and the lowlands of
Scotland the language which soon came to predominate was English, mainly
a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French, while the use of Celtic

languages persisted in Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the highlands of
Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary estimate
put the population of England and Wales at 5^ million and that of Scotland
at about 1 million. The main factor in this gradual growth of population was a
slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in Britain, as in all
countries before the development of medical science, by high death rates and,
in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from
the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain times and immigra¬
tion from Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, mar¬
riages, occupations, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful and
reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular flow of vital
statistics (that is, statistical information based on statutory registration of
births, marriages and deaths) and the periodic censuses of population.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are some 500 superintend¬
ent registrars in charge of registration districts and nearly 1,150 registrars in
charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent registrars are appointed
either by the councils of counties or of metropolitan districts and in London
by the borough councils. They act under the instruction of the Registrar
General for England and Wales, who is also director of a central government
department, the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose functions
include regulating the registration of births, deaths and marriages, the
planning and carrying out of population censuses, and the compilation and
analysis of population and vital statistics. There are corresponding authorities
and similar arrangements in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man.
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every ten
years since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the
second world war. The latest full census covering Britain as a whole was taken
in April 1971 when Britain’s population was found to number 55,515,000.
Censuses were taken throughout Great Britain (on a sample basis) and
Northern Ireland in 1966.
In mid-1973 the estimated home population of Britain (excluding the popula¬
tions of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) was 55,933,400 compared
with 53,553,000 in mid-1963, 38-2 million in 1901, and 10-5 million (in Great
Britain) in 1801. The main causes of this great increase in numbers were a
progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into
the beginning of the twentieth century.
Britain’s population density was approximately 594 persons per square
mile (229 per sq. km.) in mid-1973, but in England there were approximately
922 persons per square mile (356 per sq. km.), and in Greater London 11,935
persons per square mile (4,608 per sq. km.).

Rates
Since 1971 there has been a decline in the rate of population growth. However,
on the basis of mid-1973 population estimates and of present trends in birth
and death rates and migration, the increase in population is expected to con¬
tinue, reaching 56-6 million in 1983, 58-3 million in 1993, 59-6 million in 2003,
and 61-2 million in 2013. This represents an average growth rate of 0-2 per
cent a year over the whole period.
Growing public concern about the effects of an increasing population on an
already densely populated island led to proposals for a policy on population
matters. In 1971 the Government set up a Population Panel following
recommendations made by a House of Commons Select Committee. In its
report the panel endorsed the main recommendations of the select committee
for an official attitude on population and for comprehensive family planning
services as an integral part of the National Health Service. Provisions for
family planning advice and help within the framework of the National Health
Service were included in the National Health Service Reorganisation Act
1973 (see p. 137). In 1974 the Government announced that it proposed to
give higher priority to survey and research work to study fertility, mortality
and migration, in an attempt to discover more about the factors which have
caused the recent decline in the rate of growth of population in the United
Kingdom. The Lord Privy Seal has been given ministerial responsibility for
monitoring and co-ordinating further developments in population matters.
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was over 30 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 20 years of the century,
but natural population increase changed little.
BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. But when death rates in all
age groups fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and
1910, the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain
the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual
increase in the average age of the population. By the 1930s the birth rate had
fallen to less than half the nineteenth century rate. The population continued
to increase slowly, but its average age rose more rapidly.
IO
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Mortality
Causes
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school children, school children, and adults in their thirties
and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
48 years at birth for a boy born in 1901 and 52 years for a girl, to 68-7 years at
birth for a boy born in 1970-72 and 75 for a girl.
Since 1933 the steady fall in the number of births has ceased. During the
second world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary post¬
war peak of 207 per thousand population in 1947. It receded to slightly above
the pre-war level in the early 1950s, but from 1956 onwards began to rise,
reaching a peak of 18-8 per thousand in 1964. It has since fallen and was 13-9
per thousand population in 1973. The proportion of illegitimate births, which
reached a peak of 9-1 per cent of all live births in 1945, the end of the second
world war, fell between 1945 and 1955, when it reached 4-5 per cent; since
then it has risen, and was about 8-3 per cent in 1973.
EXPECTATION OF LIFE AT BIRTH Years
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and mor¬
tality from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under
one year old per thousand live births) has fallen from 142 in 1900-2 to 17-2
in 1973 and maternal mortality from 4*71 per thousand live births in 1900-2
to 0-14 in 1973. The reported mortality from some of the illnesses of middle
and old age, such as cancer of the lung and heart diseases, has risen during
the twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement
in diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these illnesses and improvement in positive health
does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women pre¬
ponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.

and Divorce
Fertility Trends
Age
Distribution
There are nearly 106 females to every 100 males in Britain. Formerly women
outnumbered men in every age group from adolescence onwards. Recently,
however, the fall in stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the influence
of these factors on sex ratio so that the age at which women begin to out¬
number men has advanced and is now about 45. On the other hand, the
lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for
women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women among the
elderly—there are now some 18 women over 70 years old to every 10 men—
and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population.
Over the past 30 years the proportion of the population of Great Britain who
are or have been married has risen from about 52 per cent in 1939 to 59 per
cent in 1973, while the proportion of single persons in the population aged
15 years or over has fallen from 33 -3 per cent to 22*5 per cent. This change has
been due mainly to an increase in marriage rates among men and women in
their late teens and early twenties; whereas in 1939 only 33-8 per cent of
young women aged 20 to 24 were or had been married, in 1973 the percentage
was 59-1. Earlier marriage has led to a large increase in the number of children
born to women under 30 years of age and in recent years has contributed to a
substantial acceleration of the total flow of births into the population.
There were 9 decrees of divorce made absolute in 1972 for every 1,000
married people in England and Wales; a substantial proportion of divorced
people marry again.
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family
(that is, the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married just over a hundred years ago
produced on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline
seems to have set in with those married in the 1860s, and the average family
size for Great Britain fell to less than 2*1 for those married in the decade
1934-43. There has since been some increase, and the average family size of
women marrying in recent years is about 2-3 liveborn children.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of women
getting married and of children surviving to adult life.
The effect of the fall in the birth rate beginning in the latter part of the
nineteenth century was to reduce the ratio of children and old people to
adults of working age. This ratio was at a minimum in 1930. After 1936 the
number of children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in
the birth rate after 1921, but the population aged over 64, born during an era
of high fertility and representing successive generations of steeply rising
numbers, increased very rapidly; the population aged over 40 was also in¬
creasing relatively faster than that between 15 and 40. The higher birth rates
after 1942 arrested the compensating fall in the number of children and further
reduced the proportion of people of conventional working age.
Because of this high proportion of the young and the old in the present
12

Migration
population, which is expected to increase still further, and the growing num¬
bers of young people continuing in full-time education, there is a special need
to make the best use of national human resources, both by placing those
available for work in suitable employment and by introducing technological
improvements and wider training in order to raise productivity. At the time of
the 1971 census 92 per cent of men and 55 per cent of women between 15 and
normal retirement age (65 for men, 60 for women) in Great Britain were
economically active in remunerative work (this includes those temporarily out
of work or sick). In addition some 19 per cent of men and nearly 13 per cent
of women over normal retirement age were still economically active. At the
other end of the scale, some 30 per cent of young people between 15 and 20
were continuing their education.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance of
migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over 20 million
people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the Common¬
wealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and large num¬
bers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians, entered
Britain. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from Britain’s present area
amounted to some 4 million between 1871 and 1931. Since then the balance
of migration for Britain as a whole was inward until 1967, after which a small
net outflow has been recorded. Scotland and Northern Ireland have through¬
out continued to have a net outward movement of population to countries
overseas as well as to England and Wales.
There have been two main periods of net inflow into Britain since 1931. The
first was in the years 1931 to 1940 when emigration was very low, many former
emigrants returned, there was considerable net immigration from the Irish
Republic, and extensive immigration from Europe, including about a quarter
of a million refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, from the 1950s,
resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Commonwealth coun¬
tries, particularly West Indian countries, India and Pakistan. In the three
years 1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000 people, about
three-quarters of them from the Commonwealth. It was in these circumstances
that the Government introduced the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962,
which gave it power to restrict the number of people from the Commonwealth
and, in principle, the Irish Republic who did not have citizenship of the
United Kingdom and Colonies and who might immigrate into Britain without
assured prospects of employment or adequate means of self-support. The
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 extended immigration control to citizens
of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had no close links with Britain:
broadly speaking, those neither born, naturalised, adopted or registered in
Britain nor having a parent or grandparent who was. The Immigration Act
1971, which replaced previous legislation, provides a single system of control
over Commonwealth citizens and aliens entering Britain. It confers a right of
abode—and exemption from control—on citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who are connected with Britain by birth, adoption, naturalisation or
registration or are children or grandchildren of such persons, on citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who have been resident in
Britain for a continuous period of five years, and on Commonwealth citizens
with a mother or father born in the United Kingdom. [Others (except
nationals of the European Community countries) wishing to enter Britain for
employment must have work permits.] The dependants of work permit
holders and European Community nationals may also be admitted.

The net emigration of United Kingdom citizens to Commonwealth countries
in 1973 was 38,700 and to foreign countries 11,400. Some 21,800 work permit
holders and 5,600 dependants entered Britain from overseas countries in
addition to 55,000 Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals accepted for
settlement. Over the same period residence permits were granted to some
10,400 nationals of European Community countries. (For welfare of im¬
migrants see p. 143.)
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, persons born in the United Kingdom,
the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a ship or aircraft registered in the
United Kingdom, or a territory which is still a colony, are, with insignificant
exceptions, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth. Citizen¬
ship may also be acquired: by descent from a father who is himself a citizen
otherwise than by descent and, in certain specified circumstances, from a
father who is a citizen by descent only; by registration, for citizens of Com¬
monwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children
and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies; in
consequence of an adoption order; and, for aliens, by naturalisation. The
requirements for naturalisation include five years’ residence in the United
Kingdom or Colonies or five years’ Crown service, good character, a sufficient
knowledge of English and the intention to reside in the United Kingdom or a
colony or to remain in Crown service. The requirements for registration are
similar except that most Commonwealth and Irish citizens settled in Britain
by 1st January 1973 have the right to be registered after completing five years’
ordinary residence without satisfying any other requirement. Some 45,000
persons acquired citizenship by naturalisation and registration in 1973.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country (although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he
derives it becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the
United Kingdom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to an alien.
Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will except
in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisa¬
tion or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen
is, however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires
the nationality or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens and, as such, enjoy
full political and civic rights if resident in Britain.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 21 per cent of the population aged three years and
over (some 542,400 people) at the time of the 1971 census. The Welsh
Language Council, an official body, promotes the use of the language. The
Welsh Language Act 1967 affirms the equal validity of Welsh with English
in the administration of justice1 and conduct of government business through¬
out Wales. In Scotland nearly 81,000 persons in 1961, mainly in Ross and

and, in the predominantly English-speaking areas, with the ordinary interpretation
machinery. In the Crown Courts the provision of facilities for simultaneous translation
is being improved.

Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll and Lanark, spoke the Scottish form of Gaelic,1
while a few families in Northern Ireland spoke the Irish form of Gaelic. The
Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living languages,
although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is used in addition to English for certain
official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now used
for almost all official proceedings.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that
of all other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by

country, as enumerated by censuses in 1901, 1931, 1961 and 1971 (or nearest
possible estimate) and estimated in 1973, is shown in Table 1, which also gives
figures for the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The populations of
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were in every case greater in
1961 than in 1931 and in 1931 than in 1901, and they rose again between 1961
and 1973. The high rate of increase in England is partly due to migration from
the other three countries.
Geography, history and economic factors have given rise to the differences
between the four countries and to an uneven distribution of the population
within them. Table 2 shows the areas and populations of the urban and rural
areas in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, of the eight
standard regions of England and of the seven conurbations in Great Britain
(areas of urban development where a number of separate towns have merged).
Table 3 gives figures of Britain’s larger urban populations (over 200,000).
About half the British population lives in a belt across England with south
Lancashire and West Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other,
having the industrialised Midlands at its centre. Other areas with large
populations are the central lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from
north of the river Tyne down to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol
area; and the English Channel coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less

densely populated areas are the eastern fringes of England between the Wash
and the Thames estuary, and the far south-west. Most of the mountainous
parts of Britain, including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and
the central Pennines in northern England, are very sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
widening. Though in most places the population has been increasing, there
have been local differences in the rate of increase. Many places in the Midlands
and south-east England, some south-coast areas and some of the most
prosperous parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have had increases
well above the average national rate, while remote country areas in northern
England, Wales and Scotland and some coastal resorts have had relatively
small increases. The differences result from the combined effect of natural
increase in almost all areas and net migration towards the expanding employ¬
ment opportunities of the Midlands and south and towards certain retirement
areas, mainly on the south coast.
Urban Dispersal Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses of
open country within the urban area. Table 2 shows the distribution of the
people of Britain between areas classified as urban for administrative purposes
and those classified as rural.
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the century
three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the large

conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During the
twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres have
continued to spread and merge. Nearly one-third of the population lives in the
seven great conurbations whose centres are the cities of London (Greater
London), Manchester (South-East Lancashire), Birmingham and Wolver¬
hampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds and Bradford
(West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside) and Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne¬
side).
There has been a recent decline in the numbers of people living in inner
urban areas, balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and
beyond the outer suburban fringes (limited in certain areas by the ‘green belt’
policy where little development is permitted). This applies most strikingly to
London, also to the outer areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside con¬
urbations and to such towns and cities as Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Norwich,
Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield.
Factors in the further dispersal of the last few years have been the spread of
car ownership, expansion in public transport serving journeys to work, private
property developments to meet the demand for housing, and planned transfers
of population to the new towns around London, Glasgow, the West Midlands
and Merseyside and to selected expanding towns near to the great cities.
The extent to which people in Britain move about the country for work,
housing or study purposes is shown by the finding that 10-7 per cent of
residents in Great Britain in 1966 had changed their address in the preceding
year and 33 per cent in the previous five years; 4-2 per cent had moved
between England and Scotland or Wales, or from one region to another,
during 1961-66.
SOCIAL LIFE
This section gives some points of general interest about the structure of
households and social habits in Britain as a background to the information
given in later chapters of the handbook, in particular those on housing,
transport and environmental planning. Leisure activities are described in
Chapter 23.
There were at the time of the 1971 census some i8'2 million households in
Great Britain. The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private
households (usually in families or on their own). The remainder include such
people as residents in hotels, people in hospital, in the armed services and in
educational or other institutions. Over the last quarter of a century there has
been a marked decrease in the average size of the British household. In 1947
the most common household size was three people but by 1971 the two-person
household was more usual. Of 12,000 households analysed in 1971 for the
General Household Survey, 17-1 per cent consisted of one person only, 31*3
per cent of two, 19-4 per cent of three, 18 per cent of four and 14-2 per cent of
five or more. The increasing number of households and their smaller average
size (less than three persons) reflect a number of factors including lower birth
rates, the higher proportion of married people in the population, and the
increased tendency for young people, married and single, and for independent
elderly people to have their own separate homes. Social factors such as the
greater general availability of housing, the rehousing of slum dwellers outside
city centres, and the greater readiness of people to change their place of work

have helped to weaken the family unit and increase the dangers of loneliness,
particularly for the elderly. The persisting strength of family ties is, however,
reflected in the frequency of home visiting at weekends and holiday times.
In 1972, of 19*6 million dwellings, about one-half were owner-occupied,
about one-third rented from public authorities, and one-sixth privately rented.
Towards the centre of large towns new housing is often provided in the form
of multi-storey blocks of flats, but in the suburbs most people live in streets of
semi-detached or detached two-storey houses with gardens. Altogether some
85 per cent of families in Great Britain live in houses, and about 14 per cent
in flats. Standards of new housing have improved considerably in recent years
and there has been an increase in the number of houses with modern con¬
veniences. The General Household Survey showed that over 88 per cent of
households had exclusive use of a bath or shower, that 96 per cent had sole use
of a lavatory and that 34 per cent of houses were centrally heated. Some 90 per
cent of all new dwellings built by local authorities in England and Wales have
central heating.
The rapid increase since the 1950s in the number of women at work (over half
of those of working age of whom nearly two-thirds are married) has been
accompanied by a reduction in the time spent on housework. This has been
made possible through the spread of labour-saving equipment and materials
and the greater choice of frozen and other convenience foods requiring little
preparation. Nearly nine households in ten have a vacuum cleaner, more than
two in three a washing machine, three out of four a refrigerator, nearly all an
electric iron and one in three an electric food mixer. An increasing, though
still comparatively small, number possess a dish-washing machine. Probably
less than five per cent of households employ any regular paid help, and less
than half of one per cent in England and Wales have a resident servant. Some
households get help through the local authority home help service because of
particular need, for example, if there is an invalid or elderly person in the
house or because a mother is having her baby at home.
People in full-time work benefit, among other things, from launderettes with
extended opening hours and from shops, particularly supermarkets, which
stay open late at least one evening a week.
Many households have a pet; besides cats and dogs, budgerigars and tropical
fish are popular. In 1971 it was estimated that dogs numbered 5-2 million,
cats 3 -6 million and budgerigars 3 -2 million; expenditure on pet foods is of the
order of ^150 million a year. Annual registrations of pedigree dogs at the
Kennel Club have more than trebled since 1938—reaching a total of 183,784 in
1973; the leading breed in numbers is the Alsatian. There are 3,500 dog shows
every year, of which Cruft’s is the best known.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend
it, greater educational opportunities and higher real incomes than had
previous generations.
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually from 35 to 40 a week, although
men in manual work actually work somewhat longer because of voluntary over¬
time working, while the hours worked by women and girls average somewhat
less. Flexible working hours, which allow employees to adjust their working
day provided the full number of hours is worked over a period, are being
introduced by some employers. Almost all full-time employees are entitled to
a paid holiday each year in addition to public holidays. The proportion receiv¬
ing a minimum of three weeks has substantially increased and in mid-1973
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
19
over three-quarters of employees were entitled to three weeks or more.
Britain has fewer public holidays than nearly all other European countries.
Probably more than half the working population already enjoy a five-day week
—most people employed in factories and offices have Saturdays and Sundays
free—and a further extension of five-day working in distributive trades offering
a six-day week service is in progress.
In the last decade average earnings have risen more than prices. Women’s
earnings have risen rather less than men’s. The principle of equal pay for equal
work applies in many occupations and is being extended under legislation to
come fully into force in December 1975; the average earnings of women are a
little over half the average earnings of men. The real incomes of manual workers,
especially unskilled workers and young people under 18 years old, have risen
both in absolute terms and in relation to the incomes of non-manual workers.
The weakest groups economically are retired people wholly or mainly depend¬
ent on pensions, households in which the father is dead or absent, and low
wage earners with a number of young children.
A high degree of job satisfaction is recorded in the General Household Survey.
Over 47 per cent of men and 61 per cent of women are described as ‘very
satisfied’ with their work, while another 40 per cent of men and 31 per cent of
women are ‘fairly satisfied’. Job satisfaction is highest among those still
working at 65 and over, nearly 79 per cent of whom are ‘very satisfied’.
Illustrative of the widening opportunities for education and training is the
increase in the proportion of young people benefiting from non-compulsory
education. In 1971, for instance, over 43 per cent of 16-year-olds were in
some form of full-time education, compared with 33 per cent in 1964. The
proportion of 18-year-olds continuing full-time education in universities,
colleges of education and technical colleges is also steadily increasing. A
large number of undergraduates are, moreover, ‘first generation’ students,
neither of whose parents had a university education. Although the children of
professional parents are still more likely to go on to higher education than the
children of manual workers, a higher proportion of the children of manual
workers receive higher education than in most other European countries.
Over the last decade social differences between manual and other workers
have become less pronounced. Increased prosperity and modern production
and marketing methods have allowed many workers to acquire household
goods and personal possessions previously beyond their means. The increased
diversity of market products and greater spending power have permitted a
much freer expression of individual taste for everyone. Styles in clothes, for
example, vary more according to age group than according to income group
or occupation.
The general level of nutrition is high. The movement towards a greater use
of convenience foods, and imported foods in the 1960s, has been partly off¬
set by a reversion to a slightly less expensive diet. Increases in meat and fish
prices have resulted in greater demand for poultry. Cheese and vegetables,
other than potatoes, are among the foodstuffs consumed in greater quantities
than a decade ago while the consumption of bread and flour has declined.
Regional differences in the consumption of certain foods occur, for example,
more butter is eaten in Wales than elsewhere and the Scots eat more biscuits
and cakes. Tea remains the most popular beverage, but many more people
are drinking coffee, including ‘instant’ coffee, than before. The consumption
of considerable quantities of sweets and chocolate (some 8 oz.—226-8 gr.—
per person a week) remains a notable feature of British eating habits. Many
more people are now interested in ‘good food’, both traditional English and
20
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
exotic dishes. Restaurants providing the national dishes of other countries
are to be found throughout Britain; Chinese restaurants predominate but
there are also many which specialise in Indian and Italian food. Interest in
cooking has also widened and menus have become more imaginative, helped
by cookery journalism, including television demonstrations, and a great
variety of recipe books. Increased affluence and tastes acquired abroad have
likewise increased the demand for wines, spirits and liqueurs—during the
1960s sales of wines nearly doubled and consumption increased by nearly
44 per cent between 1971 and 1973, from 7-8 pints per head to n*2 pints a
year. Beer remains the most popular alcoholic drink in Britain, consumption
per head in 1973 being nearly 197 pints.
Expenditure on food now accounts for a smaller share of total consumer
expenditure than it did ten years ago. Increases have taken place, however, in
expenditure on motor vehicles, housing, alcoholic drink, recreation and
entertainment. The proportion of expenditure on clothing and footwear has
fallen, but there have been noticeable developments such as the growing range
of leisure clothes, the more adventurous styling in men’s wear, and the large
turnover in mass-produced fashions for young people, with frequent changes
of style. In this branch of fashion, British designers have gained an inter¬
national reputation.
Although more cigarettes were smoked in 1973 (some 137,400 million or
about 47 a week per head of population) than ten years previously, the increase
was due to a trend towards smaller cigarettes and not to an increase in cigarette
tobacco consumption which has fallen since 1959. During the same period,
while sales of pipe tobacco also declined, sales of cigar tobacco increased nearly
threefold. In 1972, 62 per cent of men and 41 per cent of women described
themselves as smokers.
The greatly increased diversification and output of consumer products have
been accompanied by a growth of activity to protect and help the shopping
public. Which?, the magazine of the Consumers’ Association, a non-govern¬
mental organisation, publishes appraisals of selected consumer goods and has
over 665,000 subscribers with an estimated readership of more than three
million. Over if million people a year visit the Design Centre in London
where consumer goods which meet its criteria of good design are displayed.
Private Transport More people in Britain own cars than ever before and the number is still
rising. There is an increasing number of ‘two-car’ families and some families
have more. In mid-1973 there were about 13-5 million cars licensed on the
roads in Great Britain, compared with 5 -5 million in i960. There is still a large
number of motor cycles (including motor scooters)—1 million in 1973—but
fewer than in 1962, when the licence figure was 1 -9 million. Sales of bicycles
to the home market reached 712,640 in 1973 which, though lower than in
1959, was higher than in recent years.
Although the number of motor vehicles has continued to increase, the
number of total casualties from road accidents has not risen proportionately.
In 1973, some 7,400 persons were killed and 89,400 seriously injured, a
decrease over the previous year which continued the downward trend in total
casualties since 1967. The rate of deaths per 1,000 vehicles licensed has been
progressively reduced from 3’2 in 1930 to 0’4 in 1973 partly through advances
in medical and surgical techniques as well as in vehicle design, road construc¬
tion and road safety legislation, for instance the introduction of the ‘breath¬
alyser’ (a means of administering a breath test to indicate the level of alcohol
in the blood).
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
21
The Changing
Face of Britain
Changes in
British Society
Increasing population and social developments are affecting the physical
appearance of Britain. The spread of car ownership, which has changed the
whole pattern of leisure activities, has also led to a new and more scattered
distribution of houses and to different siting for factories, shops and offices. It
is also one of the main reasons for the large-scale urban reconstruction and
road development programmes which are being carried out. In general,
towns and cities are being altered to accommodate more traffic and house more
people; experiments are being tried in remodelling town centres with pedes¬
trian precincts; by-passes help to reduce traffic in city centres. In addition to
new roads and motorways, more reservoirs are needed to supply the growing
demand for water and more lines to carry electric power for the growing
volume of appliances.
In modern industrial society in a densely populated country there is much
scope for conflict between the need for new communal facilities and the desire
to preserve existing beauty or places of historic interest, and between potential
users of a new service and people whose way of life is threatened by the need
to accommodate it. As a result the activities of the established amenity societies,
such as the National Trust and the Council for the Protection of Rural
England, are being supplemented to a growing extent by those of groups
formed expressly to safeguard the amenities of a particular area and to give
publicity to the views of the people they represent.
Growing public concern about the dangers both to health and to the natural
environment caused by the unregulated disposal of industrial and human
waste, by exhaust fumes and by the rising volume of noise is reflected in the
appointment by the Government of a standing Royal Commission on En¬
vironmental Pollution and an Advisory Council on Noise. Voluntary societies
include the National Society for Clean Air, the Noise Abatement Society and
the Council for Nature.
In the past 20 years the traditional pattern of life in Britain has undergone
considerable change. Not only have distinctions of class and social habits
become less rigid, but subjects formerly taboo in public discussion are now
openly considered in books, plays and films and in ordinary conversation. A
more informed tolerance of behaviour which deviates from the usual pattern is
reflected, for instance, in the growing popular sympathy for the difficulties of
the unmarried mother. The passing of new laws on such matters as abortion,
divorce and homosexuality, although disliked by some people is nevertheless
indicative of public unwillingness to penalise individuals with particular per¬
sonal problems. Similarly, changes in the law applying to young offenders
reflect the view that it is unreasonable to treat children who have broken the
law as fundamentally different from other children in trouble.
This liberalising trend is balanced by a recognition that, in some areas,
restrictions on certain freedoms must be extended in the interests of society as
a whole—hence legislation on race relations and the control of dangerous
drugs and firearms.
Relationships between the generations are also undergoing considerable
change, with the result that there is today a greater readiness on the part of
children and young people to criticise traditional institutions and to seek more
influence in shaping society. This desire for personal involvement is manifest
not only among those prepared to demonstrate for or against certain courses
of action and to bring pressure on the responsible authorities, but also among
the increasing numbers of young people who offer their services to help the
old, the disabled, the illiterate, and others in need.
2 Government
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State. It is also one of the independent
members of the Commonwealth,1 all of whose members recognise the Queen
as head of the Commonwealth. In January 1973 it became a member nation
of the European Community which includes all the major powers of Western
Europe and over 80 per cent of its population (see p. 76).
The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each
of its four component parts: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
England was united under a Saxon king in the ninth century; Wales eventually
became part of that kingdom and Ireland was joined with it before the end of
the thirteenth century; and the English and Scottish thrones were dynastically
united in the person of James I and VI in 1603. In 1707 the Treaty for the
Union of England and Scotland provided that the two countries ‘should be
forever united into one kingdom’, and one Parliament (the Parliament of
Great Britain) became the supreme authority in both countries.
In 1801 the Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland 1800, which
joined the Irish Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain, established the
United Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern Ireland (now the
Irish Republic) became a self-governing country, outside the United King¬
dom. Meanwhile, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had enacted a constitu¬
tion for Northern Ireland which, while preserving the supreme authority of
the United Kingdom Parliament and reserving certain matters to that Parlia¬
ment, provided Northern Ireland with its own legislature and executive, to
deal with domestic ‘transferred’ affairs. These arrangements remained in force
until 1972 when, following several years’ political instability and violence in
Northern Ireland, a period of direct rule was introduced, with executive powers
exercised by a Secretary of State and laws made by Order in Council. In 1973
a new type of constitution for Northern Ireland was established by the
Northern Ireland Constitution Act which provided, among other things, for
the devolution of powers to a legislative Assembly and a power-sharing
Executive. These provisions came into force in January 1974, but failed to win
sufficient support among all sections of the Northern Ireland community and
were brought to an end in May 1974. In July 1974 the Northern Ireland Act
was introduced, providing for the election of a constitutional convention to
consider what arrangements for the government of Northern Ireland would be
likely to command most widespread acceptance throughout the community.
The Act provides that, in the interim, the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland is to be responsible to the United Kingdom Parliament for the
devolved services and that laws for Northern Ireland may be made by Order
in Council on matters within the competence of the (prorogued) Assembly for
one year, subject to extension or termination by the United Kingdom Parlia-
1 The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Jamaica, Trinidad
and Tobago, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Zambia, The Gambia, Singapore,
Guyana, Botswana, Lesotho, Barbados, Mauritius, Swaziland, Tonga, Western Samoa,
Fiji, the Bahamas and Grenada. In addition, Nauru is a special member, participating
in functional activities but not in meetings of Heads of Government.

ment. Responsibility for the administration of the Northern Ireland depart¬
ments rests temporarily with ministers in the Northern Ireland Office (see
P- 56).
Although one State, the United Kingdom has adopted flexible methods of
government, adapted, to some extent, to the needs of the constituent countries.1
England and Wales, on the one hand, and Scotland on the other, continue as
before the Union to have different systems of law, a different judiciary,
different educational systems, different systems of local government, and, for
most domestic matters, different government departments. In Scotland these
departments have headquarters in Edinburgh and are grouped under the
Secretary of State for Scotland, who is a member of the Cabinet.
There is also a considerable measure of devolution in the administration of
Welsh affairs to the Welsh Office, under the Secretary of State for Wales who
is also a Cabinet Minister.
I he Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies,
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of
their proximity to it and the antiquity of their connection with the Crown.
The United Kingdom Government is responsible for their defence, their
international relations and ultimately, their good government.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which have never been codified and are not directly enforceable in a court of
law, but which, nevertheless, have a binding force as rules of the constitution.
Because the constitution is not contained in any document, because it can be
altered by the passing of an Act of Parliament or by general agreement to vary,
abolish or create a convention, it can the more readily be adapted to changing
political conditions and ideas without serious disturbance to existing organs
and forms.
The organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readily
distinguishable although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They
are:
1. the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Cabinet and other ministers of the
Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(b) government departments, most of them under the control of ministers
and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for administration
at the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer and manage
many services at the local level; and (d) public corporations which may be
responsible for the operation of particular nationalised industries (see p. 193)
or of a social or cultural service, for example, and which are subject to
ministerial control in varying degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and is
independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages and chapter 4 describe these three organs of govern¬
ment in some detail in order to show how the constitution of the United
Kingdom works.
A greater devolution of central government functions to Scotland, Wales and regions
°.f England was recommended in 1973 in reports by a Royal Commission on the Constitu¬
tion (see Bibliography p. 461). A report containing proposals for Scotland and Wales
was published in September 1974.

BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Succession
Accession
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secukr institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only-once in over a thousand years; and in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. The royal lineage can
be traced back to Cerdic, King of Wessex in the sixth century, through the
Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the year 829; and to Alpin,
King of Kintyre in the ninth century through Malcolm II, whose reign in
Scotland (1005-34) was correspondingly important in that part of the realm.
According to the Royal Titles Act 1953, the royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth which owe
allegiance to the Crown the Queen’s representative is the Governor-General,
who is appointed by the Crown on the advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and is wholly independent of the United Kingdom Government.
In the United Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by
Governors who are appointed by the Crown, having varying executive and
legislative powers, and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government
for the good government of the countries concerned.
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common
law rules of descent. The Act of Settlement 1701 provided that ‘the Crown
. . . shall remain and continue to the said most excellent Princess Sophia1
and the heirs of her body being Protestants’. Subsequent Succession to the
Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and, although succession is not
bound to continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered (under a pro¬
vision of the Statute of Westminster 1931) except by common consent of the
member nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown.
Rules of descent provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in order of succes¬
sion to the throne according to their seniority; if there are no sons, the
daughters succeed in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she
becomes Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as
fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of
a king takes the rank and style of her husband; the converse, however, does
not apply and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges
to the husband of the Queen-Regnant although in practice he may fill an
important role in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new
Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the
Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord
Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and the
1 The Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England.

Coronation
Acts of
Government
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Commonwealth
are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same in
substance for nearly a thousand years although the details have frequently
been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. The
service used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was derived from
that used at the coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal
‘governor’ of the established Church of England. In practice, as a result of a
long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the monarchy
has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her
ministers which she cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does
not rule. The United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in
the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation
during the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers
without any necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of
government which require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule
she opens the new session with a speech from the throne drafted by her
ministers (although this may be read by the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is
unable to be present); and she must give Royal Assent before a Bill which has
passed all its stages in both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enactment.
The Queen is ‘the fountain of justice’ and as such can remit all or part of the
penalties imposed on people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour’,
the Queen confers peerages, knighthoods and other honours,1 and makes
appointment to all important State offices, including those of judges, officers
in the armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in
the established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the
realm of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the
State, the Queen has the power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory,
to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal preroga¬
tive which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally
left in the hands of the Crown’.2 Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few (the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order, the Most Noble Order of the
Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient Order of the Thistle) are in the
Sovereign’s personal gift.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter;
the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants; the admini¬
stration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, for example, to markets, ferries
and fisheries; the right to treasure trove; and the right to print, or to license others to
print, the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
GOVERNMENT
2?
Ceremonial and
Royal Visits
this authority is shown in three constitutional ways in which the royal will can
be expressed: by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice of the Privy
Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally by the Queen
and generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible ministers; or
by Proclamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents under the Great
Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal Warrant counter¬
signed by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the
smooth working of government; for, although the Queen has no personal
authority and must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be
informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life. The Queen holds
meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other
holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions,
reads dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them
if the Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of 18 years on
accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act 1953—
laid down that the first potential Regent should be the Duke of Edinburgh,
and thereafter those in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of
the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the
appointment of Counsellors of State (generally the wife or husband of the
Sovereign, and the four adult persons next in succession to the Crown1) to
whom the Sovereign may delegate by Letters Patent certain royal functions.
Counsellors of State may not, however, dissolve Parliament (except on the
express instructions of the Sovereign), nor create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and,
in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered outlook of both
the Sovereign and the people,2 certain traditional customs and usages remain.
Royal marriages, the birth of royal children and royal funerals are marked by
public ceremony. The birthday of the Sovereign is officially celebrated early
in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse Guards Parade and is also
celebrated as Commonwealth Day. State banquets take place when a foreign
monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom; investitures are held at
Buckingham Palace; and royal processions add significance to such occasions
as the opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham
Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating
from the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal
ordinances, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other
members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial
and charitable works of national importance ensures nation-wide interest and
support. The Sovereign herself pays State visits, often accompanied by other
members of the royal family, to foreign governments and undertakes lengthy
tours in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other members of the royal
family pay official and private visits overseas.
The Regency Act 1953 provided that Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother should be
added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.
2 The whole protocol that surrounded the monarch in past centuries has been greatly
simplified and informality emphasised whenever possible.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the
House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate; they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they do different work in different places;
and they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the
coronation, or the State opening of Parliament when the Commons are sum¬
moned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State,
however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate without the con¬
currence of all its parts (except in the case of Bills passed under the Parliament
Acts 1911 and 1949).
The Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the United Kingdom as a
whole, or any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination
of them. It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which
are Crown dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom, and have
subordinate legislatures1 which legislate on island affairs.
By the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 the life of a United Kingdom
Parliament was fixed at five years (although it may be dissolved and a general
election held before the expiry of the legal term). Because it is not subject
to the type of legal restraints imposed on the legislatures of countries with
formal written constitutions, it is virtually free during this period to legislate
as it pleases: to make or unmake any law; to legalise past illegalities and
make void and punishable what was lawful when done and thus reverse the
decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy firmly established conventions
or turn a convention into binding law. If both Houses agreed, it could even
prolong its own life beyond the normal period of five years without consulting
the electorate. In other words, Parliament is sovereign.
In practice, however, Parliament does not assert its supremacy in this way.
Its members bear in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain
throughout the centuries and act as far as possible in accordance with prece¬
dent and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament
that has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper
authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely
to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system
of party government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
On 1 st January 1973, when Britain acceded to the European Community,
the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972 (passed by Parliament)
applying the Treaty of Rome became operative (see p. 76). These provide for
various types of Community legislation, including regulations, which take
direct effect in member countries, and directives, which are binding as to the
result achieved upon each member State to which they are addressed, but
allow the national parliaments to choose the form and method of implementa¬
tion. Under the Treaty of Rome the national parliaments delegate a number
of their members to sit in the European Parliament (see p. 79).
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of
Guernsey) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy
Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member
of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative
measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.
GOVERNMENT
The Meeting of
Parliament
The House of
Lords
29
A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with
a proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council.
Such a proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and,
on the other, orders the issue of writs for election and announces the date on
which the new Parliament is to meet. This cannot be less than 20 days after
the proclamation, but it may be more.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions, each normally, though not
necessarily, of a year’s duration. Each session is terminated by prorogation—
usually effected by a commission under the Great Seal, which appoints the
day and place of its meeting in a new session (on rare occasions Parliament has
been dissolved without prorogation). The date appointed for the new session
may be brought forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The effect
of a prorogation is at once to terminate all proceedings pending (with certain
minor exceptions). This means that a Bill not completed in one session dies
and has to be reintroduced in the next, unless it is to be abandoned.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A
reassembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or on the
initiative of the Government under powers specially conferred by each House
on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is about 160,
divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until
Christmas lasting about 40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of about
50 sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun of some 30 sitting days, and
one from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40-50 sitting days.
Nowadays, the session is usually concluded with a short period of up to
10 sitting days in October, after the long summer adjournment. In most
sessions, the House of Lords sits on about 125 days.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual.
The Lords Temporal may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life
peers and peeresses created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958,
and (3) Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed under the terms of the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 to assist the House in the performance of its
judicial duties and who remain members of the House after their retirement.
The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the Church of
England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops.
Peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to
a seat in the House of Lords, provided the holder is 21 years of age or over,
but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of succession,
disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to sit
in the House of Lords but they gain the right to vote at parliamentary elections
and to offer themselves for election to the House of Commons. No hereditary
peerage has been conferred since 1965.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings of
that House. Those who do not wish to attend may apply for leave of absence,
either for the duration of a particular Parliament or for a single session.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords (the average daily atten¬
dance is about 250) include elder statesmen and others who have spent their

lives in public service. They receive no salary for their parliamentary work,
but they are entitled to travelling expenses from their homes to the Palace of
Westminster (provided they attend at least one-third of the number of sittings),
and (with the exception of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Com¬
mittees, the Law Lords and any member in receipt of a salary as the holder of
a ministerial office) they may claim payment for expenses incurred for the pur¬
pose of attendance at the House (except for judicial sittings).
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his
place on the woolsack as ex officio Speaker of the House. In the absence of
the Lord Chancellor his place may be taken by a deputy speaker appointed
by the Crown or a deputy chairman appointed by the House or, if neither a
deputy speaker nor a deputy chairman is present, by a speaker chosen by the
Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of
Committees, who is appointed each session and takes the chair in all commit¬
tees, unless the House otherwise directs. The permanent officers include the
Clerk of the Parliaments, who is responsible for the records of proceedings
including judgments and for the promulgation of Acts of Parliament when
they have received Royal Assent; the other Clerks at the I able; the Gentle¬
man Usher of the Black Rod, who is also Serjeant-at-Arms in attendance upon
the Lord Chancellor; and the Yeoman-Usher who is Deputy Serjeant-at-
Arms.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of the
community. There are 635 seats in the House of Commons (5!b for England,
36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Elections are of two kinds: general elections held after a Parliament has
been dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign; and by-elections,
held when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the death or resigna¬
tion1 of a member, or as a result of his elevation to the House of Lords.
Members are paid an annual salary of £4,500 and an allowance of £i,75° a
year for secretarial and office expenses. They also have a number of other
allowances, including travel allowances and, for provincial members, sub¬
sistence allowances.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House. Other parliamentary officers of the
House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and one or two deputy chairmen
who act as Deputy Speakers; these officers are elected by the House on the
nomination of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members of
Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is
charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing
orders, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends upon the Speaker, executes the
orders of the House and is generally responsible for its domestic staff arrange¬
ments.
1 If a member wishes to resign from the House, he may apply either for what is techni-
cally an office of profit under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds and Steward
of the Manor of Northstead), but to which, in fact, no remuneration attaches, or for a
directorship by government nomination in a commercial company which is an ordinary
trading concern.
GOVERNMENT

Electoral
System

3i
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. Permanent
Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
undertake general reviews of constituencies at intervals of not less than ten and
not more than 15 years, and report on the changes they recommend. A Com¬
mission is also empowered to submit interim reports on particular consti¬
tuencies if, for instance, it is necessary to bring constituency boundaries into
line with altered local government boundaries. The recommendations in the
last reports of the Commissions were approved by Parliament in 1970.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Act 1949 as amended by the Act of 1969. Under
the provisions of these Acts, election to the House of Commons is decided by
secret ballot in which British subjects (except members of the House of Lords)
and citizens of the Irish Republic are entitled to vote1 provided that they are
18 years old or over, and are not subject to any legal incapacity to vote. Those
eligible to vote in any constituency are those who are recorded on the register2
of electors for the constituency as resident in that constituency on a date fixed
by statute. Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person at a polling
station, although members of the armed forces, Crown servants of the United
Kingdom and staff of the British Council employed overseas, and wives or
husbands of such persons, if resident overseas with their married partners,
may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain cases by proxy, may also be
allowed if the voter cannot attend in person because of physical incapacity or
the nature of his work or on grounds of religious observance. British subjects
who are on the electoral register and who are temporarily abroad on business
may vote by proxy if they cannot return in time for polling day; those who are
away on holiday cannot vote. The plurality system of voting is used; candidates
are elected if they have a majority vote over the next candidate (although not
necessarily an absolute majority over all other candidates).
Anyone, male or female, who is a British subject aged 21 or over, and is not
otherwise disqualified may stand as a candidate in any constituency at a qJloj
parliamentary election. Those who are disqualified include members of the
House of Lords, clergy of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, fev
the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged bank¬
rupts, and those expressly disqualified by the House of Commons Disqualifica¬
tion Act 1957—for instance, holders of judicial offices, civil servants, members
of the regular armed forces and the police forces, and government-nominated
directors of commercial companies which are ordinary trading concerns.
The conduct of elections, including the manner in which candidates can be
nominated for election, is likewise governed for the most part by provisions of
the 1949 and 1969 Acts. The maximum sum of money that a candidate may
spend on his election campaign is £1,075, Plus for each eight electors in
a borough constituency and £0*06 for each six electors in a county constitu¬
ency. A candidate may send by post (free of postal charge) an election address
to each elector in his constituency. All other expenses, apart from the
candidate’s personal expenses, must be covered by the statutory sums.
The party system, existing in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, is an essential element in the working of the constitution.

BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general
election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any
other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then indicates, by its
choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies
it would like to see put into effect.
The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the
general elections of February 1974 and June 1970 is shown in Table 4, and the
number and percentage of votes cast for the principal parties in Table 5.

The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the
Sovereign, usually on the advice of senior ministers; and its most outstanding
members in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial
appointments on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party
becomes the official Opposition with its own leader1 and its own council of
discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties or any
independents who have been elected may support the Government or the
Opposition according to their party’s or their own view of the policy being
debated at any given time. On occasions no party succeeds in winning an

overall majority of seats in the House of Commons; then a minority govern¬
ment might be formed, as after the February 1974 election, or a coalition.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable
extent upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must govern
and therefore accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the minority
should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism to be heard. The
detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the direction
of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, by the Government Chief
Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief Whips
together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the House of
Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for debating
some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of the House
is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is his duty
to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters about which
it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates, and conveying upwards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons
is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government Whips,
three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal Household,
five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury and five are
paid Assistant Whips. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief Opposition Whip
and his counterpart in the House of Lords, and to two of the Assistant Whips
for the Opposition in the House of Commons. The Government Whips in the
House of Lords hold offices in the Royal Household and sometimes act as
spokesmen for the Government in debates.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of
the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds
necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to put relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratifi¬
cation of certain international treaties and agreements (in spite of the fact
that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary approval).
Parliamentary procedure is largely based on custom and precedent, supple¬
mented by standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The
system of debate is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every
matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and
resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be; and members speak
from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum. The main
difference is that in the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general
sense of the House, whereas in the Commons the Speaker has full authority to
give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and orders of the House. He
must carefully guard against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minor¬
ity rights, and it is his duty to allow or disallow any closure motion (that is, a

motion to end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote). He has
certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to save the
time of the House in various other respects. In case of grave disorder he has
power to adjourn the House or suspend the sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast for and against the motion under debate, the Speaker must
give the casting vote, but he does so only in accordance with rules which pre¬
clude an expression of opinion on the merits of the question.
The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the
House of Commons, except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but
no casting, vote—the House of Lords being generally governed by the principle
that unless there is a majority in favour the question is decided in the negative.
When the House is sitting judicially (see pp. 83 and 88) the question is put in
such a way that, if the votes are equal, there is no interference with the order
under appeal.
The House of Commons has agreed in principle to the establishment of a
compulsory register of members’ pecuniary interests. Members with a direct
pecuniary interest in a matter before the House must abstain from voting in
connection with it. In any proceedings of the House or in transactions with
other members or with ministers or civil servants, members must disclose any
relevant pecuniary interest or benefit.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare occa¬
sions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceedings
and in the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The
Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily.
Records of both Houses from 1497 are available to the public in the House of
Lords Record Office.
Public Bills can be introduced by any member of either House, but no Bill
involving taxation or the spending of public money will proceed very far in
the Commons unless the Government agrees to introduce a ‘money resolution’
to cover it. This has the effect of giving the Government control over a wide
field of legislation. In the House of Commons certain days are set aside for
debating private members’ Bills1; that is, public Bills introduced by mem¬
bers of the House not holding office in the Government, who have been suc¬
cessful in the ballot, held early in each session, of members wishing to introduce
Bills. Peers can introduce private members’ Bills in the House of Lords at any
time during a session without notice. Also, persons and bodies outside Parlia¬
ment can promote private Bills relating solely to matters of individual,
corporate or local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless their main purpose is financial,
when they must be introduced in the Commons. As a rule, however, Bills likely
to raise political controversy go through the Commons before the Lords,
while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature are frequently intro¬
duced and debated in the Lords before being sent to the Commons.
The process of passing a public Bill is basically the same in the House of
Lords as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal first reading
on introduction; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies
1 A private member may also present a Bill after Question Time on notice given, or seek
leave to introduce a Bill under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, that is, the standing order which
allows a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of the Bill before
the House decides whether or not to grant leave. If a private member’s Bill secures a
second reading, the Government will usually introduce any necessary money resolution.

between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it
is given a second reading after a debate on its general merits or principles. In
the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a Second Reading
Committee to recommend whether or not it should be taken as read a second
time. After a second reading in the Commons a Bill is referred for detailed
examination either to a standing committee or, if the House so decides, to the
whole House sitting in committee; in the Lords it is referred to a committee
of the whole House. The committee stage is followed by the report stage,
during which previous amendments may be altered and additional amend¬
ments may be suggested and incorporated. The last stage is the third reading
which provides an opportunity for a Bill to be reviewed in its final form. In
the Commons this stage is taken without debate unless there is a motion on
the Order Paper in the name of six members that the question be not put
forthwith—a procedure of which substantial use is made. After the third
reading, the Bill is sent from the Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to
the Commons (depending on its place of origin), when it enters on the same
course again. Any amendments which the second House makes to the Bill
must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise reached, before the
Bill can become law.
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment such financial Bills1 as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing taxa¬
tion, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the Supply
Services from the Consolidated Fund. These Bills are introduced upon
resolutions in the House of Commons; they may be initiated only by a
Government minister.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are
sent for Royal Assent, which is given by the Sovereign in Letters Patent and
is declared to both Houses by their Speakers or, occasionally, by Royal Com¬
mission. The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been exercised since
the early eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would
never reach the Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—
at any rate until a new government came into power, when it might be re¬
introduced. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot prevent a Bill insisted upon
by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal course of events,
they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return it unchanged; or they
revise and improve it by amendments and return it for the consideration of
members of the other House, who frequently agree to the amendments made.
They can, however, delay a non-financial Commons Bill for about 12 months.
These limitations on the powers of the Lords are based on the belief that the
principal function of the modern House (which is a non-elected assembly) in
respect of legislation is to act as a chamber of revision: in other words that its
object should be to complement the House of Commons and not to rival it.
In substance, a private Bill goes through the same procedure as a public
Bill but most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a
semi-judicial pattern: the promoters must prove the need for the powers or
1 Under the Parliament Act 1911 a Bill that deals only with taxation or expenditure
must receive Royal Assent within one month of being sent to the House of Lords,
whether or not the Lords have agreed to it, unless the House of Commons directs to the
contrary.

Parliamentary
Committees
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
privileges that they seek and objections on the part of opposing interests are
heard. Both parties may be represented by counsel.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a Committee of
the Whole House, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their
second reading. A Committee of the Whole House is presided over by the
Chairman of Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of
Lords) or a Deputy Chairman.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of which
exist to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and complex
work. They are:
1. Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons to
deal with public Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the
second reading and the report stages. With the exception of the Scottish
Grand Committee1 (which considers Scottish estimates and other matters
relating exclusively to Scotland), and the Welsh Grand Committee2 (for
which parallel arrangements exist), standing committees3 consist of from
16 to 50 members nominated for each Bill by the Committee of Selection
(a body normally consisting of 11 members drawn from the main parties
in the House in accordance with party strengths at the beginning of each
session). The procedure of a standing committee is generally similar to
that of a Committee of the Whole House.
2. Select Committees, which are appointed to enquire into and report to the
House on special matters. Select Committees are appointed by either House
when the occasion for such an appointment occurs, or at the beginning of a
session (some of them by standing order) to consider all aspects of a particular
subject that may arise during the session. The latter type of committee is
known as a ‘sessional’ committee and includes in the House of Commons
the Committee of Public Accounts, the Expenditure Committee, the Com¬
mittee of Privileges and the Committees on Public Petitions, House of
Commons (Services), European Community Secondary Legislation and
Nationalised Industries. In the House of Lords there are committees on the
European Community, special orders, personal Bills, procedure, offices,
privileges, leave of absence and the Appeal and Appellate Committees. The
House of Commons also has a few specialist select committees such as those
on race relations and immigration and on Scottish affairs. Other committees
include the Standing Orders Committee which has duties relating to private
Bills; and joint select committees of both Houses of Parliament which may
be appointed at the instance of either House.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
important party organisations or committees: the Conservative and Unionist
Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, which consists
of the back-bench membership of the party; and the Parliamentary Labour
Party, which is a corporate body comprising all members of the party in both
Houses.
1 The Scottish Grand Committee comprises all the members for the Scottish constitu¬
encies and not less than ten nor more than 15 others.
2 The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales,
with up to five other nominated members.
3 Not more than two Scottish standing committees may be appointed and each must be
so constituted as to include not less than 16 members representing Scottish con¬
stituencies.
Delegated
Legislation
Parliamentary
Control
GOVERNMENT 37
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in Council
or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to Ministers of the
Crown, to government departments for which ministers are responsible, or to
organisations whose regulations are subject to confirmation or approval by
ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for them. More¬
over, the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated
normally provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation
made in the exercise of these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament
the right to confirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require
direct consultation with organisations which will be affected thereby before
rules and orders are made.
A joint committee of both Houses checks the technical propriety of statu¬
tory instruments,1 and a standing committee of the House of Commons
considers their merits.
Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’. A number of opportunities for a searching examination of
government policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back¬
benchers are provided in parliamentary procedure. In the House of Commons
such opportunities include:
1. Question Time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation,
answer questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible.
So much parliamentary time is devoted to scheduled public business that
questions are regarded as one of the best means of eliciting hitherto un¬
published information about the Government’s intentions, as well as an
effective way of airing, and possibly securing some redress of, grievances
brought to the notice of members by their constituents. (Another means
available to members is by way of the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—see p. 38.)
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
Whitsun and the summer) there is a whole day spent discussing matters
for which the Government is responsible raised by private members. More¬
over, if a member wishes to discuss a ‘specific and important matter that
should have urgent consideration’ he may, at the end of Question Time,
ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker accepts
the terms of the motion, he asks the House for leave for it to be put forward.
Leave can be given unanimously, or if 40 or more members support the
motion, or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and the House
1 Statutory instruments (‘SI’) are made in accordance with the provisions of the
Statutory Instruments Act 1946.

(on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter is debated
for three hours, usually on the following day.
3. The practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates has ceased to be
a consideration of the financial requirements of the Government and has
become an occasion for the examination, initiated by the Opposition, of
some aspect of the Government’s administrative policy.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the address in reply to the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
a session, during debates or motions of censure for which the Government
gives up part of its own time; and during second reading debates.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter 17, Finance.
Arrangements have been made in both Houses of Parliament to keep
members informed about European Community developments, and to enable
them to scrutinise and debate matters which are to be decided in Community
institutions. These include the provision of Community documents and
explanatory memoranda, oral ministerial statements and reports, special
allocation of parliamentary time for debates and questions, and the establish¬
ment of select committees (one in each House, see p. 36) to identify important
Community proposals.
The Parliamentary Commissioner is an independent statutory officer whose
function is to investigate complaints of maladministration brought to his
notice by members of the House of Commons on behalf of members of the
public. His powers of investigation extend to actions taken by central govern¬
ment departments in the exercise of their administrative functions, but not to
policy decisions (which are the concern of the Government). Certain administra¬
tive actions are also outside his jurisdiction; these include matters affecting rela¬
tions with other countries and the activities of British officials outside the
United Kingdom.
In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and reports his findings to the member of
Parliament who presented the case. The Parliamentary Commissioner reports
annually to Parliament and may submit such other reports as he thinks fit. A
Select Committee has been appointed to consider his reports.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties.
These rights apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown
for the Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include freedom of speech in debate;
freedom from arrest; and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective
privilege of the House. Further privileges include the right of the House to
control its own proceedings (so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers
if it so wishes); the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for member¬
ship and to declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise
those who commit a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate;
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker
as in the House of Commons; they exist independently without grant.

THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Committees of
the Privy
Council
Judicial
Committee
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council.
Nowadays the Privy Council is responsible for advising the Sovereign to
approve Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing funda¬
mentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal preroga¬
tive, such as Orders approving the grant of Royal Charters of Incorporation;
and those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of
delegated legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy
Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not there¬
by become personally responsible for the policy upon which the Orders are
based; this rests with the minister responsible for the subject matter of the
Order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parlia¬
ment. The Privy Council’s own statutory responsibilities, which are indepen¬
dent of the powers of the Sovereign in Council, include powers of supervision
over the registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council
(which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation
of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence
in some branch of public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. There
are usually about 330 Privy Counsellors. The whole Privy Council is called
together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces
his or her intention to marry.
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These committees, which have advisory functions, may be preroga¬
tive committees, such as those which deal with legislative matters sub¬
mitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and with
applications for the grant of charters of incorporation; or they may be provided
for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the
Scottish universities.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the Lord President of the Council.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council derives its appellate jurisdiction
from the right of subjects of the Crown to appeal for redress to the Sovereign
in Council if they believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
It is now the final court of appeal from the courts of the United Kingdom
dependencies, from the courts of those independent members of the Common¬
wealth (including certain countries of which Her Majesty is no longer Queen)
which have not elected to discontinue the appeal, from prize courts1 in the
1 Prize courts deal with matters concerning property captured in time of war which, by
grace of the Crown, falls to the forces which assist in the capture.

United Kingdom and dependencies, from the courts of the Channel Islands

It also has jurisdiction in a limited class of English ecclesiastical appeals.
Appeals are heard by a board of the committee, whose members are usually
selected from the Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords of Appeal
in Ordinary, although other members of the Privy Council who have held high
judicial office (including chief justices and certain other judges from Common¬
wealth countries overseas) are asked to sit from time to time. In theory the
Judicial Committee does not deliver judgment. It advises the Sovereign who
acts on its report and approves an Order in Council to give effect thereto. Its
decisions, though not binding on the English courts, are treated with great
respect by them.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. How¬
ever, the Government must be fully represented by ministers in the House of
Lords as it requires spokesmen of standing to expound its policy and justify
its actions to that House. The Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a ministerial office with entirely new functions requires legislation, but the
abolition of an office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another,
or a change in the designation of a minister may be effected by Order in
Council. Functionally ministers may be classified under the following heads:
The Prime Minister, who is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for
the Civil Service.
Departmental Ministers, who are in charge of government departments. The
holders of these offices (most of whom are in the Cabinet) are known as
‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the
case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury
and a number of sub-departments). There are also some ministers with the
status of a minister in charge of a department not represented in the Cabinet,
who are responsible, under a Secretary of State, for a particular part of the
activities of the department concerned.
Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster,1 the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and Ministers with¬
out Portfolio. Sometimes these ministers have few or no departmental duties
and are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister
may wish to entrust to them.
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
is separately administered by the Chancellor.

Salaries
The Prime
Minister
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a Minister of the Crown
with departmental functions and also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State who are appointed to government departments in which the
work is particularly heavy and complex or where it involves frequent travelling
abroad.
Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under
Secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates, answering parliamentary questions, and assisting in departmental
duties. In certain cases, however, they may be given responsibility, directly
under the head of the department, for specific aspects of the department’s
work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the other Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips.
Ministerial salaries range from £20,000 a year for the Prime Minister and
£13,000 for Cabinet ministers to £5,500 for junior ministers. Senior ministers
not in the Cabinet and Ministers of State receive between £9,500 and £7,500.
The Prime Minister and ministers in the House of Commons also have a
parliamentary allowance of £3,000 and other allowances paid to all members
of the House. The Lord Chancellor receives £20,000 a year, £2,000 of which
is attributable to his speakership of the House of Lords.
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the holder
of this office derives from his ability to command a majority in Parliament and
from his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to
obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. Nowadays, by convention,
the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a
general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences and
approving important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet
is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in the House
of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions on its
general administration in that house.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary, and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord Lieutenants of counties1 and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower,
and some university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The
Prime Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various

public boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. He likewise makes
recommendations to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions, and selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
A specialist unit advises the Prime Minister on domestic policy matters, and
is in close contact with government departments and the Central Policy
Review Staff (see p. 45).
The Cabinet is composed of ministers personally selected by the Prime Minister
(in September 1974 these numbered 22), and may include the holders of
departmental and non-departmental offices. Its origins can be traced back to
the informal conferences that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers,
independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth century. After the
Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the eighteenth century,
and the development of organised political parties stimulated by successive
extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet assumed its
modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments. The
exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a
group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the support
of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publica¬
tion of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been
in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the
Public Record Office) and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement
involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission
of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister. From a practical point of view,
this secrecy is essential in the interests of full and frank discussion, which can
be maintained only if there is no risk of publicity for every statement made and
every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the
amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great
deal of the work of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system,
which involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet com¬
mittee or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily con¬
cerned. The committee then considers the matter in detail and either disposes
of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations for action.
Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when matters
affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be members
of Cabinet committees.
The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office
attend meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate. A record is
kept of the conclusions and of the main points made in discussion.
GOVERNMENT
43
Ministerial
Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual
responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a particular matter
has been decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he chooses
to resign, as he is free to do if he cannot agree with his colleagues on a matter
of general policy or on a single major issue.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admini¬
stration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually a Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they will usually wish to consult
their colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. Any
decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way
of bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament dis¬
courages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies. In all other respects they must order their affairs in such a way
that there is no conflict between their public duties and their private interests.1
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may,
and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations operating under varying degrees of
government control.
A few departments have existed for over 200 years. Many more have come
into existence during the past half-century to match the widening scope of
government activity. The election of a party of a different political complexion
does not necessarily affect the number or general functions of government
departments, although a radical change in policy may be accompanied by some
organisational change.
The work of some departments, for instance, the Ministry of Defence,
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments, for instance, the
Department of Employment, cover Great Britain (England and Wales, and
Scotland, but not Northern Ireland); others, such as the Department of
1 A Royal Commission was established in 1974 to inquire into the standards of conduct
in public life in Britain.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Education and Science and the Department of the Environment are mainly
concerned with affairs in England, and there are separate departments for
Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is also a separate department with
responsibility for affairs in Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, the minister in charge of the Civil Service Department is
responsible for the Central Office of Information, Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office, and the Department of the Government Actuary; and Treasury
ministers are responsible for the Board of Customs and Excise, the Inland
Revenue, the Department for National Savings and a number of small depart¬
ments including the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Royal Mint, the
National Debt Office and the Public Works Loan Board. Generally, depart¬
ments receive their funds directly out of money provided by Parliament and
are staffed by members of the Civil Service (see p. 58).
Internal Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
Organisation work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging
its duties there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, how¬
ever, have certain features in common: for instance, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary,
sometimes assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one
or more deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and
assistant secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance
officer and a principal establishments and organisation officer. Many depart¬
ments also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, economists, statisticians
and their own information divisions. The Government Statistical Service which
includes the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Business Statistics Office
(BSO), the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the statistics divi¬
sions of the major departments, provides a service of statistical information
and advice. Each department is responsible for compiling statistics relating to
its own policy area and publishing them, usually through its own publications.
Information about individual industries is published by the BSO in Business
Monitors. Comprehensive statistical publications are produced by the CSO.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Advisory Bodies Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or com¬
mittees (several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect informa¬
tion, mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before coming
to a decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a
statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee, but usually
advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned be¬
cause he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved. Some are expert committees; others include
civil servants and representatives of varying interests and professions, for
instance, industrialists, trade unionists, university and industrial scientists,
educationists, lawyers and local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommenda¬
tions on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal Commissions,

whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience and
diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by Royal Warrant). Royal Commissions
examine written and oral evidence from government departments and other
interested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence submit recom¬
mendations. The Government may accept the recommendations in whole or
in part, or it may decide to take no further action or to delay action. Inquiries
may also be undertaken by departmental committees, appointed by the head
of the appropriate department.
The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions (as in
September 1974) of the main government departments. They are arranged in
alphabetical order, except for the Cabinet Office, the Civil Service Depart¬
ment, and the Treasury (which, in view of their central position, are placed
first) and the Scottish and Northern Ireland departments (which are grouped
at the end of the section). Further information on the work of departments is
given in later sections under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direc¬
tion of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central
Policy Review Staff, the Central Statistical Office and the Historical Section.
Other functions are undertaken by the office from time to time.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of
Cabinet business. It operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy
at the highest level. Functions of the office include circulating the memoranda
and other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business,
preparing agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording
their discussions and circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the pro¬
gress of action on decisions, and safeguarding the security of documents.
The Central Policy Review Staff advises ministers collectively on major
issues of policy.
The Central Statistical Office co-ordinates the statistics collected by depart¬
ments and produces statistics needed for central economic and social policies
and management, such as the national accounts, balance of payments, financial
statistics and measures of output. It is responsible for a number of statistical
publications.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing
the Official Histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the
preparation of official histories of certain peace-time events.
The Civil Service Department is under the control of the Prime Minister as
Minister for the Civil Service, with responsibility for the day-to-day work
of the department delegated to a senior minister. The department’s Permanent
Secretary is also the official head of the Home Civil Service.
The department is responsible for personnel management in the Civil Ser¬
vice, which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment, training
(including the Civil Service College), promotion, general career management,
catering, welfare and retirement. It is also responsible for the size and deploy¬
ment of manpower, for pay, pensions, and conditions of service in the Civil
Service, and for the co-ordination of pay and pension policies in the public
sector as a whole. The department’s further responsibilities include the
development and application of new systems and techniques in the field of
management and administration; the provision of a central management ser¬
vices consultancy for the Civil Service as a whole to deal with management

subjects and techniques such as organisation and methods and operational
research; and central planning, procurement and co-ordination of data pro¬
cessing in government.
The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for the recruitment of
civil servants, forms part of the Civil Service Department. In matters con¬
cerned with recruitment policy, the commissioners are responsible to ministers
in the normal way, but in the selection of individuals for appointment, they
act under Order in Council and are completely independent of ministers.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except Bills or provisions of Bills extending exclusively to
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The office
drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and amendments moved
by the Government during the passage of Bills; it advises departments on
questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings (and committees)
of both Houses. The counsel also draft subordinate legislation when specially
instructed, and advise the Government on legal, parliamentary and constitu¬
tional questions falling within their special experience.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and five junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never
meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by the Paymaster General, the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury and the Financial Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary
to the Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip in the House of
Commons.
The Treasury is the government department primarily responsible for the
development of Britain’s overall economic strategy. Work is carried out by
three main groups: the Public Sector Group which has the broad function of
controlling the level of public expenditure and ensuring that resources are effi¬
ciently used within the public sector; the National Economy Group which is
responsible for the preparation of short-term and medium-term economic
forecasts and the co-ordinated economic strategy based on these forecasts, for
home financial transactions, markets and institutions generally, and for the
surveillance of certain areas of economic policy administered primarily by
other departments—namely, fiscal and industrial policies; and the Overseas
Finance Group, which is responsible for questions affecting Britain’s foreign
currency reserves, international monetary policy, and overseas aid.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England
and Wales for administering government policy for the agriculture, horti¬
culture and fishing industries. Directed by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, its functions include the administration, in co-operation
with the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce (see p. 47), of the agri¬
cultural support system as modified by the adoption in 1973 of the Common
Agricultural Policy of the enlarged European Community. The ministry also
administers schemes such as those designed for the control and eradication
of animal and plant diseases and for the improvement and drainage of agricul¬
tural land; and it exercises responsibilities relating to applied research and
development. In addition the ministry is concerned with the safety and quality
of food and with food hygiene, including standards of its composition, labelling
and advertising, food additives and contaminants; and it has certain responsi-

bilities for ensuring public health standards in the production and handling of
basic foods in cargoes, stores and slaughterhouses. These measures are being
harmonised with European Community legislation where it already exists. The
ministry also acts as agent of the Department of Prices and Consumer Protec¬
tion for the detailed administration of subsidies on food.
A number of the functions relating to agriculture and fisheries in Wales are
the joint responsibility of the minister and the Secretary of State for Wales. In
regard to the operational control of certain diseases of animals the ministry’s
responsibilities extend to Scotland.
The ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in certain of the activities of a number of inter¬
national organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food, such as
the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, and the Organi¬
sation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce was set up under the Euro¬
pean Communities Act 1972. An executive body subject to the direction and
control of ministers responsible for agriculture, the board deals with the
implementation in the United Kingdom of the market support arrangements
and certain other aspects of the European Community’s Common Agricultural
Policy provided for under the guarantee section of the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
administer the customs and excise duties, including value added tax, im¬
posed from time to time in the annual Finance Acts or by other legislation,
and to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected with
them. The board is also responsible for preventing and detecting evasion of
the revenue laws.
The board undertakes, for other departments, a wide range of non-revenue
agency work, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on
the import and export of certain classes of goods, exchange currency control,
and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade statistics from customs
import and export documents. Parliamentary responsibility for the board’s
work is exercised by Treasury ministers.
The Ministry of Defence is the government department responsible for defence
policy and for the control and administration of the three Services—Navy,
Army and Air Force (including the procurement of defence equipment). The
Secretary of State for Defence is in charge of the department, assisted by a
Minister of State. Three Parliamentary Under Secretaries are severally respon¬
sible for each of the three Services.
The Department of Education and Science promotes education generally in
England and Wales and post-school education in Wales. It is responsible for
the Government’s relations with universities in Great Britain, and it fosters
the progress of civil science both in Britain and in collaboration with other
countries. The department also has responsibilities relating to the library
service, support for the British Library and the administration of the Victoria
and Albert and Science Museums in London.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science is assisted by a Minister
of State and a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, while the minister
responsible for the arts, who is also a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,

deals with policy on the promotion of the arts and on libraries and museums.
Among the matters relating to the development of school and post-school
education for which the department has responsibility are the broad allocation
of resources for education, the capital programmes for the building of new
schools and other institutions, the supply, training and superannuation of
teachers, and the basic standards of education. The department works in co¬
operation with local education authorities whose duty it is to provide and run
the schools and colleges in their areas. Its relations with the universities are
conducted through the University Grants Committee. Activities concerning
civil science are discharged through five research councils: the Medical
Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environ¬
ment Research Council, the Social Science Research Council and the Science
Research Council. On questions of scientific policy an advisory board for the
research councils advises the Secretary of State.
The Department of Employment is generally responsible for Britain’s man¬
power policy and deals with the payment of unemployment benefit, the re¬
payment of income tax to unemployed workers, the collection and publication
of statistics on labour and industrial matters, relations with the International
Labour Office, and representation on employment and related matters at
sessions of other international bodies. The Secretary of State for Employment
is assisted by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of
State.
Responsibility for the provision of a public employment service and for the
promotion of industrial training has been transferred to an independent Man¬
power Services Commission, which discharges its duties through two bodies,
the Employment Service Agency and the Training Services Agency. Super¬
vision of the safety and health of people at work is being transferred to a new
Health and Safety Commission, organised on lines similar to the Manpower
Services Commission. A new Conciliation and Arbitration Service, inde¬
pendent of the Department of Employment, has also been established.
Members of the two commissions and of the Conciliation and Arbitration
Service Council are appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment.
The Department of Energy is responsible for the development of government
policies in relation to all forms of energy. It discharges governmental functions
connected with the nationalised coal, gas and electricity industries; it is
responsible for the Atomic Energy Authority, and is the sponsoring depart¬
ment for the nuclear power industry. It deals with the development of off¬
shore oil and gas resources in the British sector of the continental shelf. The
department sponsors the oil industry, and deals with the international aspects
of energy problems, including relations and co-operation with oil-producing
countries. It is the co-ordinating body for energy conservation policy, and for
encouraging the development of new sources of energy, being assisted by the
Energy Technology Support Unit at Harwell, Berkshire. The Secretary of
State for Energy is supported by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary
Under Secretaries of State, one of whom is concerned with the development
of oil from the North Sea.
The Department of the Environment, under a Secretary of State, is respon¬
sible (in England) for a wide range of functions relating to the physical
environment in which people live and work.
In addition to his overall strategic responsibilities as head of the department,

the Secretary of State deals directly with policy on international pollution
matters and the department’s research programme. He is assisted by three
senior ministers:
The Minister for Transport is responsible for ports; general transport policy
including transport grants to local authorities; railways; freight movement; the
Channel Tunnel; road safety; and inland waterways.
The Minister for Planning and Local Government is responsible for land
use and regional planning; land compensation and betterment; new towns;
minerals; local government structure and finance; and countryside policy.
The Minister for Housing and Construction is responsible for the policy and
finance of the housing programme; the construction industries; and the Pro¬
perty Services Agency (which provides nearly all government common ser¬
vices relating to land, property, buildings and furnishings).
There are two Ministers of State: one has special responsibilities for sport
and recreation, water and sewage and pollution policy; the other is responsible
for special urban planning problems, historic towns, buildings and monuments
and conservation. There are three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State in
the department.
The Department of the Environment is also concerned with the co-ordina¬
tion of work on the prevention of environmental pollution, with special res¬
ponsibility for clean air and anti-noise functions; research into roads, building,
hydraulics, water pollution, fire prevention and the uses of timber; and,
through the Property Services Agency, with government property manage¬
ment and building functions.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department which is responsible to the Secre¬
tary of State for Trade, provides protection to exporters, merchants, investors
and banks against overseas credit risks by export credit insurance policies
which cover exporters against the main risks of not receiving payment; by
guarantees to banks financing export trade which provide an acceptable
security; and by insurance which covers new investments against risks of
expropriation, blocked remittances, or war.
The use of the department’s services is optional, premiums being charged
at rates which enable the department to be run as a self-supporting business.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides, mainly through diplomatic
missions, the means of communication between the British Government and
other governments and international governmental organisations for the dis¬
cussion and negotiation of all matters, including economic issues, falling within
the field of international relations. In particular the department is responsible
for alerting the British Government to the implications of developments over¬
seas ; for protecting British interests overseas, including commercial interests;
for protecting British citizens abroad; and for explaining British policies to,
and wherever possible cultivating friendly relations with, governments and
peoples overseas. The department is also responsible for the discharge of
British responsibilities in the associated states (mainly for defence and external
affairs) and dependent territories. In the dependent territories, each of which
has its own internal administration, the British Government is finally respon¬
sible for good government and for the relations between these territories and
other countries.
The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is assisted
by two Ministers of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
He is the United Kingdom representative in the Council of Ministers of the
European Community.

which the most important are the maintenance of the peace and the preroga¬
tive of mercy. He is assisted by two Ministers of State and a Parliamentary
Under Secretary of State.
The chief matters with which the Home Office is concerned are: the admin¬
istration of justice; the law relating to the conduct of parliamentary and local

Department of Energy and the Department of Prices and Consumer Pro¬
tection.
The Secretary of State for Industry is assisted by two Ministers of State and
two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Central Office of Information is a common service department which
produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by other government departments which are responsible for the
policy expressed in its work. In the United Kingdom, it conducts government
press, television and poster advertising, produces booklets, leaflets, films,
television material, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material, and
distributes departmental press notices. For the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio and
television material, books, graphics, magazines, reference services, films,
exhibitions, photographs, display and reading-room material; and manages
schemes for promoting the overseas sale of British periodicals and newspapers.
It provides exhibition services (except for trade and cultural exhibitions); and
it organises tours (other than those sponsored by the British Council) for
visitors officially invited to Britain. There are nine regional information
offices in England, which provide services for the home departments and
assist the overseas services by the provision of material and by arranging tours
for overseas visitors; similar services are supplied on an agency basis by the
information staffs of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices.
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax,
corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, estate duty and certain other
direct taxes, and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters
connected with them. It is also responsible for the valuation of real property
for such purposes as compensation for compulsory purchase, local rates in
England and Wales, and estate duty; and it collects tithe redemption annuities.
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales—the Attorney
General and the Solicitor General—appear on behalf of the Crown in import¬
ant civil and criminal proceedings and in proceedings before international
tribunals such as the international court at The Hague and the European
Commission and Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. The Attorney
General is the senior legal adviser to the Government. He has the ultimate
responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law and his consent is
necessary before proceedings for a number of criminal offences can be com¬
menced; the Director of Public Prosecutions is subject to his superintendence.
Legal proceedings for the enforcement of public rights and on behalf of the
interests of charity are conducted in his name and the functions of the Queen’s
Proctor, who has certain duties connected with the operation of the divorce
laws, are exercised under his direction. The Attorney General is also spokes¬
man for the Lord Chancellor in the House of Commons on matters affecting
the administration of justice. The Solicitor General is subject to the authority
of the Attorney General, with the same rights and duties. The Law Officers,
who are leading barristers and are always members of the House of Commons,
are assisted, particularly in parliamentary work, by a Parliamentary Secretary.
Their office has a small professional staff.

The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by an
eminent ex-member of the judiciary or of the Bar and carrying Cabinet rank.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian
of the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor is the minister primarily responsible
for the administration of the courts and of the law. The Home Secretary
has important responsibilities in respect of the criminal law but the Lord
Chancellor appoints magistrates and recommends to the Crown most other
appointments to the judiciary in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. His
responsibility for the courts and for their administrative staff is exercised
through six regional (or circuit) offices and their sub-offices.
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for law reform, for appointing the
members of the Law Commission, and for presenting the commission’s
reports to Parliament. He is also concerned with court procedure.
In addition, the Lord Chancellor is a leading member of the Judicial Com¬
mittee of the Privy Council; he appoints the chairmen of certain administrative
tribunals in England and Wales, and (with the Secretary of State for Scotland)
the members of the Council on Tribunals; and he is responsible for the admin¬
istration of the Judge Advocate General’s Department,1 the department of

the Treasury.
The Ordnance Survey is responsible for the surveying and mapping of Great
Britain. This includes geodetic surveys and associated scientific work, topo¬
graphic surveys and the production of maps at appropriate scales from these
surveys. The department also undertakes a considerable amount of agency
work for other departments, particularly the Ministry of Defence, and for the
Institute of Geological Sciences and the Land Registry. Parliamentary
responsibility for the Ordnance Survey is exercised by ministers of the Depart¬
ment of the Environment.
The Ministry of Overseas Development is responsible for Britain’s policy of
financial and technical assistance to developing countries. Under the direction
of the Minister of Overseas Development (who is assisted by a Parliamentary
Secretary) it is concerned with the aid programme as a whole and for its
detailed composition. The provision of financial assistance includes both
grants and loans (the latter mostly interest-free since 1965); technical assist¬
ance comprises the supply of British experts and equipment, the training of
overseas personnel, and the support of research and advisory services.
1 The Judge Advocate General’s Department advises the Secretary of State for Defence
and the Defence Council on legal matters arising out of the administration of military
law, and reviews the proceedings of army and air force courts martial.
2 The Official Solicitor is concerned with the interests of minors and people with a
mental disability involved in proceedings in the High Court, who would otherwise not
be represented. In addition he protects the interests of people committed to prison for
contempt of court, acts as Receiver for people with a mental disability, and can be
appointed as Judicial Trustee in complex and disputed trusts.

The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament
is transferred (in such sums as may be required from day to day) from the
Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; their recipients obtain payments
through the commercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in
turn reimbursed by the Paymaster General’s Office.
The department is also responsible for the regular payment of many public
service pensions.
The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose director is also the
Registrar General for England and Wales, is concerned with the regulation of
civil marriages, the registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and
Wales, and control of the registration services. Its work also includes the pre¬
paration and publication of reports on vital, medical and demographic statistics,
taking the periodical census of the population, and, through the social survey
division, conducting research into the attitudes and circumstances of indivi¬
duals through direct contact with sample members of the general public or of
particular groups.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, under the direction of a
Secretary of State, has responsibilities for consumer affairs covering consumer
protection, consumer credit, standards and weights and measures. It also
supervises the work of the statutory Price Commission, and deals with prices
in the shops. The department carries out government policy in relation to
monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices and the Office of Fair Trading.
A Minister of State and a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State assist the
Secretary of State.
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number of
government departments in England and Wales. The duties of his department
include instructing Parliamentary Counsel on Bills and drafting subordinate
legislation, representing other departments in court, and giving general advice
on the interpretation and application of the law. The department undertakes
a considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of real
property, administers residuary estates (estates undisposed of by will) of cer¬
tain deceased persons, and deals with the outstanding property and rights of
dissolved companies. The Statutory Publications Office is staffed and con¬
trolled by the Treasury Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the
Statute Law Committee (a body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from
among the judiciary and legal profession in England and Scotland).
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; others have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based
on or deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work,
have their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also the Queen’s Proctor (an officer who has
certain duties in connection with the divorce laws).
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) is the central purchasing organisa¬
tion responsible for supplying the home and overseas public service with paper,

printing, binding, books, periodicals, office supplies, and office machinery.
The department also provides services, such as duplicating, addressing, photo¬
copying, micro-copying, distribution and repair of office machinery.
As publisher for Parliament and the Government, HMSO produces a wide
range of printed matter in its eight printing works and through private printers
under contract. It operates six binding works, two of which are involved in the
repair of manuscripts from national archives. Official publications are sold by
government bookshops in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Belfast, Bristol,
Cardiff and Birmingham, and through agents in Britain and overseas. HMSO
is also the United Kingdom agent for European Community publications, and
for those of the principal international organisations. The Controller is
Queen’s Printer of Acts of Parliament, and the copyright of all British Govern¬
ment documents is vested in him.
The Department of Trade is responsible, under a Secretary of State, for
general overseas trade policy, commercial relations and tariffs, including those
aspects of relations with the European Community. It sponsors the work of the
British Overseas Trade Board in export services and promotions, overseas
finance and planning. In addition, it is responsible for matters arising from
companies legislation, supervision of the insurance industry, the insolvency
service and the work of the Patent Office. Other responsibilities include civil
aviation, marine and shipping policy, tourism, the hotel and travel industries,
the newspaper industry and the film industry. The Secretary of State for
Trade is assisted by two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Secretary of State for Wales, a Cabinet minister, has full responsibility in
Wales for ministerial functions relating to child care, health, housing, local
government, primary and secondary education, town and country planning,
new towns, water and sewerage, roads, forestry, tourism, national parks and
historic buildings, and shared responsibility for the administration of urban
grants to areas of acute social deprivation, and (with the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food) for agriculture in Wales. Assisted by two Parlia¬
mentary Under Secretaries of State, he has, in addition, a general oversight of
government policy in Wales, and certain responsibilities relating to the national
library and the national museum. The Welsh Office maintains close and con¬
tinuous working relationships with the government departments mainly
concerned with economic and social planning through the Welsh Planning
Board and Welsh Council. The Welsh Office is centred in Cardiff; there is also
a small ministerial office in London.
Responsibility within the United Kingdom Government for Scottish affairs
rests with the Secretary of State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister. At minis¬
terial level he is assisted by two Ministers of State and two Parliamentary
Under Secretaries of State. There are also two Scottish law officers—the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
The Secretary of State discharges most of his functions through five main
administrative departments (the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland, the Scottish Development Department, the Scottish Economic
Planning Department, the Scottish Education Department, and the Scottish
Home and Health Department). He is advised and assisted (particularly on
questions such as the allocation of resources and forward planning, with which
more than one of the departments are concerned) by a management group,
consisting of the five heads of departments under the chairmanship of the

Permanent Under Secretary of State, the senior official in Scottish adminis¬
tration. The Secretary of State is in varying degrees responsible for a number
of other Scottish departments, and bears ministerial responsibility, together
with other appropriate ministers, for statutory bodies whose functions extend
throughout Great Britain or the United Kingdom. The day-to-day administra¬
tion of departments of the Secretary of State (generally known collectively as
the Scottish Office) is conducted in Edinburgh, but there are representatives
in London for liaison and parliamentary duties.
The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland has a general re¬
sponsibility for, and in most cases administers, government measures for the
promotion and development of farming in Scotland. It also has responsibilities
for the oversight and protection of the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh¬
water fisheries, and functions relating to certain harbours.
The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of services
affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and country
planning, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage, coast protection, flood
prevention, building standards and the prevention of river and air pollution
(most of which are administered by local authorities). The department is also
responsible for general policy in regard to local government organisation and
finance.
The Scottish Economic Planning Department is responsible for industrial and
economic development including the Scottish aspects of regional policies in
both British and European Community contexts and the development of North
Sea oil resources. It is also concerned with general policy in relation to the
Secretary of State’s responsibilities for Highlands and Islands development,
transport, electricity, tourism, new towns, and rural development.
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for the development of
public education in Scotland in all its forms (except universities). Through its
Social Work Services Group the department has a responsibility for the
guidance of local authorities in their provision and development of social work
services. It is also concerned with sport in Scotland, including the financing of
the Scottish Sports Council, and with the development of the arts in Scotland,
having responsibility in this connection for the administration of the National
Galleries of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum (including the Scottish
United Services Museum), the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland,
and the National Library of Scotland.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for the central
administration of functions relating to law and order, including the police
service, criminal justice and legal aid and the administration of penal institu¬
tions. It also has responsibility for the administration of the National Health
Service in Scotland, legislation relating to public service superannuation
schemes in Scotland and for the administration of the teachers’ and National
Health Service superannuation schemes. The Home and Health Department
is the central authority in Scotland for the fire service, for certain home de¬
fence and emergency services, and for legislation concerning shops, theatres,
cinemas, licensed premises and land tenure matters.

In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Department of the Registrar-
General for Scotland (the General Register Office); the Scottish Record Office;
and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the
direction of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in
Scotland of the policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with
Scottish conditions and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecutions in the sheriff court, which are con¬
ducted by officials of the Procurator Fiscal Service. In some of this work the
Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s Department and the
Scottish Courts Administration. The members of the Lord Advocate’s
Department also act as legal advisers on Scottish questions to certain govern¬
ment departments who have no Scottish legal adviser of their own. The work
relevant to prosecutions is centred in the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland, incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department, are responsible to the minister concerned and to the
Law Officers for the drafting of government Bills affecting the law of Scotland.
The Scottish Courts Administration has a general responsibility to the Secre¬
tary of State for the organisation, administration and staffing of the courts
and court offices, and is responsible to the Lord Advocate for certain functions
in the field of law, including the programme of the Scottish Law Commission,
the jurisdiction and procedure of the Scottish courts, enforcement of judg¬
ments and proposals for the reform of the law.
The United Kingdom Government and Parliament are responsible in Northern
Ireland for law and order (including the police, the criminal law, courts, and
penal institutions); matters pertaining to elections and the franchise; and
matters of national importance such as the Crown, foreign policy, defence,
and certain aspects of taxation. Under the Northern Ireland Act 1974 they are
also temporarily responsible for the wide range of domestic matters previously
devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland
Executive (see p. 22).
The Northern Ireland Office is the department of the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland who, assisted by two Ministers of State and two Parliamen¬
tary Under Secretaries of State, has overall responsibility, and is fully answer-
able to Parliament, for the government of Northern Ireland. In addition to
exercising personal responsibility for constitutional developments, law and
order and security in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State is closely con¬
cerned with financial and economic matters in the Province. The four other
ministers are in charge of the various Northern Ireland departments, the
activities of which are co-ordinated as necessary.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who is paid wholly and directly out of money voted
by Parliament and works in a civil capacity in a department of government.
There are about 700,ooo1 civil servants (one-third of them women), roughly
280,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of public services—paying
sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes and contributions, running
employment services, staffing prisons, and providing services to industry and
agriculture. About 270,000 are employed in the Ministry of Defence, in¬
cluding the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dockyards. The remainder
is about equally divided between: central administrative and policy duties;

whole-time officer.

service-wide support services, such as accommodation, printing, and informa¬
tion; and services which are largely self-supporting financially, for instance
those provided by the Department for National Savings and the Royal Mint.
About 75 per cent of civil servants work outside the London area, and plans
have been made for further dispersal from the capital.
The total of civil servants includes about 180,000 industrial staff, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments, whose pay and condi¬
tions of service are largely separately administered, and differ quite sub¬
stantially, from those for non-industrial grades.
Stability of administration is ensured by the political neutrality of the service.
Although a civil servant works under the authority and direction of the minister
of the department to which he is appointed, legally he is a servant of the Crown.
A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a government
or the advent of a government of a different political complexion, does not
involve a change of permanent staff.
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Nineteenth-century reforms included the substitution of open
competition for the practice of obtaining Civil Service appointments by favour
or purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, the Civil Service
Commission, to control recruitment. The great expansion in State activity in
the first half of the twentieth century, and the consequent increase in the
numbers of civil servants and the scope of their duties, led to further re¬
organisation, including the creation of service-wide scientific and professional
classes; recruitment was adapted to a developing educational system, and
co-ordination between the various departments improved. Civil servants,
though they remained employees of their departments, became members of an
integrated service with common conditions of employment and traditions and
standards of conduct belonging, not to individual departments, but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
More recently the structure and management of the Civil Service has again
been under detailed internal scrutiny following the report of the Fulton com¬
mittee which in 1968 assessed the structure, recruitment and management,
including management training, of the service. As a result of the report, the
Civil Service is engaged upon a programme of reshaping and modernisation,
designed to make it more effective in carrying out its changing tasks.
The structure of the Home Civil Service, which until recently tended to reflect
the assumption that specific types of work should be allocated to particular
groups of civil servants on the basis of their specialist or vocational qualifica¬
tions, is at present being redesigned to provide for a more flexible deployment
of staff so that talent can be used to the best advantage and the highest levels of
the Civil Service seen to be open to people of outstanding ability, whatever
their specialist background or original method of entry to the service. These
structural changes involve the abolition of classes, and are being allied with
personnel management policies designed to ensure that, although work
requiring specialist skill is always done by appropriately qualified individuals,
people with the necessary aptitudes are given suitably wide experience to fit
them for higher posts.
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly con¬
cerned with higher management and policy, there is now an open and unified

structure, with three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary and
under secretary—available for all types of post. Posts at these levels are filled
by the people most suitable for them without regard to their academic back¬
ground or to whether they were previously in a specialist or generalist stream.
At other levels the structure is being based on a system of categories which
are pay and grading structures and occupational groups which are groups of
staff within each category, whose members have common personnel manage¬
ment and recruitment needs. Four new categories have so far been created,
and the groups of staff that are so far members of them are shown below.
The Administration Group contains some 263,000 staff. Their functions range
from the co-ordination and improvement of government machinery and the
formulation of advice to ministers on matters of policy to the performance of
normal clerical duties connected with the running of departmental business at
lower levels.
The Economist Group contains about 260 staff. They provide economic
advice and undertake economic analysis.
The Statistician Group (some 400 staff) undertakes the collection and
analysis of statistics required for government policies (see p. 44).
The Information Officer Group (some 1,300 staff) carries out a variety of
specialised press, publicity, public relations and information work.
The Science Category contains the Science Group (16,000 staff), which is
responsible for conducting scientific research and testing in numerous govern¬
ment laboratories and testing establishments, and for providing advice on
scientific policy. Its members also participate in the planning and management
of advanced technology procurement projects.
The Professional and Technical Group contains some 38,000 staff and
includes a range of professionals—architects, surveyors, quantity surveyors,
and electrical and mechanical engineers—and appropriate supporting staff,
whose main function is to plan and oversee a wide range of government
construction and procurement activities, and to carry out certain inspection
and regulatory activities.
The Illustrator Group contains about 500 staff responsible for the prepara¬
tion of all forms of artwork applied to the wide range of requirements within
the Government service.
Within the Training Category the Instructional Officer Group comprises
nearly 5,000 staff employed on instruction in a trade, craft or subject, or on
ancillary or supervisory duties connected with instruction.
The four categories already established account for some 60 per cent of the
non-industrial staff; the remainder are in due course to be allocated to one of
the three main categories or, where this is impossible, to additional categories
to be set up for the purpose. Such staff include those in a number of ‘general
service’ classes (that is to say, classes whose members serve in a number of
departments), for instance, the medical and legal classes.
The Civil Service employs about 23,000 shorthand typists, audio typists, and
copy typists, who work mainly in small groups, and about 4,000 personal
secretaries who work mainly to senior civil servants.
There are about 25,000 other support staff, including paperkeepers, office
cleaners and messengers. (As far as practicable, posts of messengers are
reserved for ex-servicemen, although other men and women over the age of
30 may be recruited.)

The Diplomatic Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
which provides the staff (comprising some 6,300 civil servants) for service in
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom diplomatic
missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent Commonwealth
countries. Its functions include advising on policy, negotiating with overseas
governments and conducting business in international organisations; promot¬
ing British exports and the advancement of British trade; presenting British
ideas, policies and objectives to the people of overseas countries; and protecting
British interests abroad.
The service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with
that of the Home Civil Service; it also has secretarial, communications and
security officer branches. Various specialists and advisers from home depart¬
ments or the armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or
attachment to the Diplomatic Service.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which, subject to regional differ¬
ences, is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being
effected through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of staff
between the two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter
for departmental agreement in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but
when vacancies cannot be filled by this means the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Crown Agents for
Oversea Governments and Administrations are asked to recruit other can¬
didates, principally from the United Kingdom.
Recruitment to the Civil Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service
Commission which, working in conjunction with departments, ensures that
staff are selected on the basis of fair and open competition. The selection of
junior staff, especially those engaged in clerical and manual work, is under¬
taken almost entirely by departments. The commission, however, always
issues the ‘certificate of qualification’ necessary for permanent appointment.
The appointment of a successful candidate is made by the department in
which he is to be employed.
For the administration group, which forms the central part of the Home
Civil Service, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achieve¬
ments of university honours graduates; 18-year-old school-leavers; and 16-
year-old school-leavers. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
—the Administration Trainee entry—comprises qualifying tests, followed by
a series of tests and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an
interview by the Final Selection Board. For most other entries selection from
among those possessing the necessary academic qualifications is normally by
interview only.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications in the subject concerned, and selection is on the basis of past
record and by interview.
In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task it is to help identify the training needs of the
staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for their
varying requirements. The number of management courses run within the

Civil Service, including those provided at the Civil Service College, has
increased substantially during recent years. Some use is also made of external
management courses in business schools, the Administrative Staff College,
Henley, and other centres.
Methods of training within the Civil Service combine lectures, discussion
groups, instructional visits and case-studies with the use of many audio-visual
aids such as closed-circuit television and video-tape recordings, instructional
films and programmed learning: there is also a considerable amount of ‘on-the-
job’ training. Civil servants are regularly moved between the different branches
of their department and sometimes between departments so that they can gain
as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service work.
In order that they may continue their education, arrangements are made for
the release of civil servants under the age of 18 usually on one day a week (‘day
release’ schemes) to attend appropriate courses. Adult staff are assisted
financially to undertake, mainly in their own time, private studies leading to
recognised educational or professional qualifications in approved subjects.
There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellow¬
ships or otherwise to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of
interest to themselves or their departments.
Training is co-ordinated by the Personnel Management (Training) Division
of the Civil Service Department which is responsible, in conjunction with the
Civil Service College, for the analysis and determination of training needs to be
met centrally, and which exercises advisory functions in regard to depart¬
mental training. All central training is provided by the Civil Service College
which offers a wide range of courses and seminars (some of a broad develop¬
mental nature and others more job-related) for civil servants, including those
in specialist groups, at various levels up to and including that of under
secretary. Subjects covered include structure and machinery of government,
organisation and staff management, economics, statistics, industrial growth,
social administration, operational research, computers and information systems.
The college also provides courses on European institutions and their
working, and is developing links in a variety of matters, including training,
with other European countries.
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the Civil Service.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted examinations and
partly by the departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to most
of the highest positions in the service (for instance, permanent secretaries,
principal establishment officers and principal finance officers) are approved by
the Prime Minister, who is advised in these matters by the head of the Home
Civil Service.
The consideration governing all promotion is the advancement of the
efficiency of the public service—the criterion being the fitness of an officer for a
more senior, responsible post. Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but
a procedure of accelerated promotion has been worked out for administration
trainees and officers who have shown exceptional promise but are outside the
age and salary limit for a particular grade.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
GOVERNMENT
Political and
Private Activities
63
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil and Public
Services Association, the Society of Civil Servants and the Institution of
Professional Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair
comparison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every civil
servant who is capable and efficient may reasonably expect a full career in
the public service and is entitled to receive redundancy payments and pension
benefits.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work such long hours as may
be necessary without additional pay. The standard working week for office
staffs is 41 hours in London and 42 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies
according to grade and length of service up to a maximum of six weeks (that is,
30 working days a year).
Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be
granted to civil servants for up to six months in any 12 months, and on
reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years; any
officer whose health is permanently impaired may be retired on medical
grounds.
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the day
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free, as a
private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who are
completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political activities
(although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign their
appointment before nomination day on the understanding that if not elected
they will be reinstated in their previous capacity within a week of the declara¬
tion of the election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance of the
need for discretion and with the permission of the department, to take part in
most activities except parliamentary candidature; and those who are debarred
from national political activities though they may seek permission to take part
in local government political activities. In the non-industrial Civil Service, the
completely free groups are members of the minor classes such as cleaners and
messengers. The intermediate group includes mainly members of the clerical
and typing grades and the granting of permission by the department depends,
broadly, on the nature of the work done. The remainder are not allowed to
take part in national political activities. Permission is usually granted to
members of all groups to engage in local political activities to the maximum
extent consistent with the reputation of the Civil Service for political im¬
partiality and the avoidance of any conflict with official duties. Where per¬
mission is granted, it is subject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to
notify the department of election or co-option to a local council.
All civil servants enjoy the right to register their private political opinions
on appropriate occasions, for instance, at general or local authority elections.
They may also engage in such private activities as they wish, provided that

these do not in any way conflict with their official duties, nor with the pro¬
visions of the Official Secrets Acts 19111 and 1920, and the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1906. However, since a civil servant must not use his official
position to further his private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in
commerce and business: for instance, he may not hold private interests in
public contracts and he may not use official information in writing, broad¬
casting or lecturing without the approval of his department.
The political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of official
concern, but there are some civil service duties in which secrecy is so vitally
important to State security that the Government does not feel itself justified
in employing anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For this
reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively associated or in
sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist organisations, or is liable
to be a security risk in any other respect, is employed in connection with secret
work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security,
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals with
national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public
service and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security
arrangements is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Government on a local basis has been part of Britain’s administrative system
for many centuries, although the modern conception of a comprehensive
system of locally elected councils to manage various services provided for the
benefit of the community was first incorporated in statute law in the nine¬
teenth century. Following the large population increase and the transforma¬
tion in the range, complexity and scale of local authority functions in the
twentieth century, local government was reorganised in Greater London in
the 1960s and in the rest of England and Wales in 1974. A similar reorganisa¬
tion is to take full effect in Scotland on 16th May 1975. Changes in the
structure and functions of local government in Northern Ireland were made
in October 1973.
The local government system essentially comprises a pattern of elected councils
for defined areas. The councils represent their own localities and provide a
local level of democracy; and they make available a wide range of services in
their areas.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Act of Parliament (or by measures made under the authority of an Act). The
actual administration and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits are
the responsibility of the local authority, but, in respect of certain services, Acts
of Parliament dealing with local government give ministers of the Crown
defined powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national
uniformity in the standard of service provided or to safeguard public health,
while others are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For some
1 Proposals have been made to modify this Act by limiting the areas in which the
safeguarding of official information requires the protection of the criminal law.

services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others
there are strictly limited powers. Government policy is to ensure that central
government controls over local authorities are kept to a minimum.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The main links between local authorities and the central Government are:
in England, the Department of the Environment; in Scotland, the Scottish
Development Department; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern
Ireland, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside the Greater London area) is a division of the country into 53 large
county authorities (see map on p. 66), within which there are 369 smaller
district authorities. Both types of authority have independent, locally elected
councils, and have separate functions to perform. County authorities normally
provide the large-scale local government services, while the districts are
responsible for the more local ones (see p. 68). However, in six of the English
counties, which are in heavily populated areas and known as ‘metropolitan’
counties, responsibility for certain large-scale services rests with the district
authorities. In England populations in the non-metropolitan counties range
from 283,000 to about 1-4 million (the Isle of Wight with a population of about
110,000 is an exception), and in the metropolitan counties from 1*2 to 2*8
million. District authorities within metropolitan counties have populations of
between 173,000 and i*i million; other districts’ populations average between
75,000 and 100,000 although many fall outside this range. English parish
councils or meetings in villages and small towns serve as focuses for local
opinion as bodies with limited powers of local interest. In Wales similar
functions are discharged by community councils.
Greater London—an administrative area of about 610 square miles (1,580
sq km)—is administered by the councils of 32 London boroughs and the City
of London, and by the Greater London Council.
Scotland, until May 1975, is divided into counties, counties of cities, large
and small burghs and districts, each with its own elected council—over 400
authorities altogether: 33 county councils (two pairs being combined for
certain purposes); 201 town councils (including four for counties of cities—
Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow); and 196 district councils (two
counties not being divided into districts). In May 1975 these authorities will be
replaced by nine new regional authorities, divided into 53 districts, and three
virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles.
Local community councils are to be formed to express local views and to take
action in the interests of the community.
The pattern of local authorities, and of their electoral arrangements, is kept
up to date by three Boundary Commissions—one for England, one for Wales
and one for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland local environmental services are the responsibility of
26 district councils; area boards and local offices responsible to the appropriate
central departments administer other services at a local level.
Local councils comprise a number of elected councillors presided over by a
chairman.
Members of local authorities are unpaid. With the exception of parish
councillors, they can claim a flat-rate attendance allowance as of right (without

proof of loss of earnings) on the performance of council business; they are also
entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances.
Each council annually elects a chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts
have the ceremonial title of borough granted by royal charter and some are
cities. In boroughs and cities the chairman is normally known as the Mayor (in
the City of London and certain other cities, he is known as the Lord Mayor).
In Scottish counties the chairman is called the Convenor, and in the burghs,
the Provost or Lord Provost.
The term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government is
usually four years. County and district council elections were held in England
and Wales in 1973 in anticipation of the local government reorganisation in
1974; county council elections will take place in 1977 and every fourth year
thereafter. From 1975, the metropolitan district elections will be held for a
third of the seats in each year when there is no county council election; the
non-metropolitan district councils can adopt the same procedure or choose
block elections in 1976, 1979 and every fourth year thereafter. In London the
next Greater London Council elections will be held in 1977, and elections to
the London borough councils take place in 1978. In Scotland elections for all
the new councils were held in 1974. To bring elections into an alternate
region/district two-year cycle, the first two terms for district councillors will
be of three years each. Elections are held every four years in Northern Ireland.
Procedure at local government elections is governed by rules made for England
and Wales under the Local Government Act 1972; for Scotland by rules made
under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973; and for Northern Ireland
by the Electoral Law Acts (Northern Ireland) 1962-71, the Electoral Law
(Northern Ireland) Orders 1972 and 1973.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is
not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government
elector for the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for regis¬
tration as a local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register
(compiled annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern
Ireland, a person must be 18 years of age or over and must have been born in
Northern Ireland or, alternatively, have resided continuously in Britain for
seven years immediately prior to the qualifying date.
A candidate for election as councillor—man or woman—normally stands
as a representative of one of the national political parties, as a member of an
association representing some local interest, or as an independent. He must be
of British nationality and aged 21 or over. In addition, he must be registered as
a local government elector in the area of the local authority to which he seeks
election; or have resided or occupied (as owner or tenant) land or other pre¬
mises in that area during the whole of the 12 months preceding the day on
which he is nominated as a candidate; or, in that 12 months, have had his
principal or only place of work there. A candidate is also subject to a number of
statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable people do not
offer themselves for election.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local
council elections. Administrative counties in Great Britain are divided into
electoral divisions returning one or more councillors in accordance with orders
made by the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland. Districts
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are divided into electoral ‘wards’ and
burghs in Scotland are either divided into wards or, if they are small, left as
68

single units. In Scotland in the new regions and islands areas the electoral areas
are called electoral divisions, each returning a single member; the districts are
divided into wards, similarly returning a single member. For parish or com¬
munity council elections, each parish or ward of a parish (or, in some cases, a
combination of parishes) forms an electoral area which returns one or more
members. For the purpose of elections to the Greater London Council,
parliamentary constituencies form the electoral areas, with each constituency
returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer
concerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting is similar to that for
parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more res¬
tricted. In Great Britain each elector has one vote for each seat contested in
his electoral area: he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than
one vote for each candidate. In Northern Ireland the 1973 local government
elections were held on the basis of proportional representation.
The functions of local authorities are far reaching. Some are framed primarily
as duties mandatory on an authority, others are purely permissive.
Broadly speaking functions in England and Wales are divided between
county and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible
for matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring
the support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division
of functions is slightly different.
In England all county councils are responsible for such matters as strategic
planning, transportation planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer
protection, refuse disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and
the personal social services are functions of county councils in non-metro¬
politan areas and of district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils
are responsible, for instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on
most planning applications and refuse collection. They may also provide off-
street car parks subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to operate
some functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks—
are available at both levels; arrangements in each area depend on local
agreement.
In Greater London the London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London are responsible for the same range of functions as district councils in
metropolitan areas (with the addition of consumer protection). The Greater
London Council (GLC) deals only with those services which by their nature
require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the inner
London area education is administered by the Inner London Education
Authority, an independent committee of the GLC. Responsibility for highways
in London is divided according to the type of road: principal roads (the main
strategic road network) are a matter for the GLC, while the London boroughs
look after non-principal roads. The boroughs are primarily responsible for the
provision of housing, although the GLC also maintains a stock of housing. It is
additionally involved in such matters as the provision of housing outside
London for people from the London area, assisting the inner London boroughs
in relation to slum clearance, the provision of accommodation for people on the
London boroughs’ housing waiting lists, and the rehousing of their own tenants

and those of the London boroughs whose accommodation needs have changed.
Greater London and certain areas just outside are policed by the Metropolitan
Police Force, which, unlike county police forces, is directly responsible to the
Home Secretary and not to local police authorities (see p. 98).
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non-metro¬
politan areas of England. The main differences are that Welsh district councils
are responsible for refuse disposal; they may, subject to the consent of the
county council, provide on-street as well as off-street car parking facilities;
and they may, exceptionally, be designated to exercise library and consumer
protection functions.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for most of their func¬
tions to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority. The excep¬
tions to this general rule are functions relating to education, police, the per¬
sonal social services and national parks.
In Scotland the councils of the cities are all-purpose authorities; elsewhere
the county councils, town councils and district councils share responsibilities.
The new regional and district authorities will from May 1975 exercise a
separate range of local government functions in a way broadly similar to that
envisaged for the new authorities in England and Wales, except that Orkney,
Shetland and the Western Isles, because of their isolation, will have single,
virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental services are administered by the
district councils, but control of roads, water supply and sewerage services
is exercised in each district by a local office of the Northern Ireland Depart¬
ment of the Environment working in close association with the district council
and its staff. Responsibility for planning is similarly exercised by local offices
of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning. Area boards,
responsible to appropriate central departments, administer locally education,
public libraries and the health and personal social services.
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
discharge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system,
whereby questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and
committees are appointed to administer the various services. Parish and
community councils are often able to do their work efficiently in full session
although they appoint committees from time to time as necessary. Many
councils have rationalised their organisation by reducing substantially the
number of their committees. Some have established policy advisory or co¬
ordinating committees with powers to originate policy, subject to the approval
of the full council. Advice to enable the new councils to determine appropriate
management principles and structures has been given in the report of an official
study group (see Bibliography, p. 462).
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be advisory
or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in
connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p. 71), or making financial
demands on other authorities liable to contribute, which are legally reserved
to the council as a whole.
Local authorities can make arrangements among themselves for the dis¬
charge of their functions. These include co-operation through joint commit¬
tees, joint teams and the loan of staff. One authority may discharge functions

on behalf of another, and may also supply others with a wide range of goods and
services.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and of
committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if the
council (or committee) resolves that publicity for that matter would be pre¬
judicial to the public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees, of
whom there may be tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Generally
speaking, councils are free to make such appointments as they think necessary
for carrying out their work. Most of the statutory controls and requirements in
relation to the appointment of staff in England and Wales have been removed
by the Local Government Act 1972.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in an administrative, a professional,
clerical or technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the
physical work for which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments
are usually made at the instance of the committee or committees particularly
concerned; most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who
are also responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engage¬
ments are always made in conformity with the council’s set establishment and
committees are informed of any appointments which they have not made
themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council. They are based on recommendations
madeby the Whitley Councils (seep. 62), of which the largest are the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical
and Clerical Services and the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’
Services (Manual Workers). Conditions of service and salary scales for senior
local government officers are determined by separate joint committees for
England and Wales, and for Scotland. The local government service in
Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating machinery at various levels.
Local authority expenditure in the United Kingdom (on both current and
capital accounts) was nearly £11,000 million in 1973. Capital expenditure (just
over a quarter of the total) is normally financed by borrowing. Housing is the
major element of capital expenditure, representing about a third of the total.
Current expenditure by local authorities accounts for just over a quarter of
total current-account spending by public authorities. The education service
represents approximately half of this expenditure, followed by the police,
roads and public lighting, the personal social services, and sewerage services
and refuse disposal. Local authority current account receipts derive from three
principal sources: government grants (nearly a half in 1973); local rates paid
by occupiers of land and buildings (almost a third); and rents from council
houses, and other income (about a fifth).
Government grants are normally related directly to total local authority
current expenditure and payable in aid of revenues generally (when they are
known as rate support grants). Grants are also paid towards the cost of
specific services (for example, the police), usually towards current expenditure,
but outright grants are made towards the capital costs of certain services,
1 An inquiry into the finance of local government in Great Britain was started in 1974.
GOVERNMENT

mainly principal roads, and annual subsidies are payable for local authority
housing. In 1974-75 the estimated rate support grants in England and Wales
amount to £3,000 million, while grants for specific services represent some
£300 million. The grants for Scotland are £412 million and £37 million
respectively.
The rate support grants are distributed between authorities in three parts:
the ‘needs’ element which for 1974-75 takes into account total population,
numbers of pupils in various types of education, the demand for various
personal social services, the sparsity and the rate of decline of population
where appropriate, and various regional factors; the ‘resources’ element which
is paid to all authorities whose rateable resources per head of population are
below a national standard; and the ‘domestic’ element which compensates
rating authorities for loss of rate income resulting from reductions in rate
poundage which they are required to give to householders. Grants are also
made towards the cost of rate rebates for people with low incomes.
In Northern Ireland the district councils receive specific grants plus a
resources element towards the (mainly local environmental) services they are
to provide.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of non-agricultural land and build¬
ings to meet the cost of local services (after allowing for grants and other
income). Each occupier’s payment is calculated annually by the rating autho¬
rity by multiplying the rateable value of his property (broadly equivalent to its
annual rental value) by the rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value
fixed by the authority according to its projected financial needs. Rateable
values are assessed periodically in England and Wales by the Board of Inland
Revenue, which is independent of local authorities. The present valuation
lists came into force in 1973. Disputes about rating assessments are heard by
local valuation courts, each consisting of three members of an independent
local valuation panel and then, on appeal, by the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales;
but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities (from May 1975 by regional and islands councils). Appeals
are heard by the valuation appeal committee of each valuation area and there¬
after by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Session. In North¬
ern Ireland the valuation authority is the Commissioner of Valuation, whose
office is part of the Department of Finance.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the district councils and London borough councils. Expenditure by
county councils and the Greater London Council is met by contributions from
district councils and London borough councils respectively, who take these
into account in the rates they levy. Following reorganisation in Scotland, every
authority will determine a rate for its own services, but the collection of rates
and the administration of rating will be the responsibility of regional and
islands councils. In Northern Ireland rates are set by the district councils
(district rate) and by the Department of Finance (regional rate); both will be
collected by the department.
Agriculture throughout Britain is exempted from rate payments, and in
Scotland and Northern Ireland industry and freight transport are rated at a
half and a quarter, respectively, of their net annual value. Householders in
Great Britain benefit from rate reductions financed by government grant
and they have the right to pay rates in ten instalments a year. House¬
holders with small incomes are entitled to rebates. Charities pay half the full

rate on property they occupy for charitable purposes but may be given further
reliefs by the rating authorities, which are empowered to reduce or remit the
rates for a wide range of non-profit-making bodies.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure either
under general powers conferred by national legislation or under special powers
provided by Acts of Parliament of local application. For items of expenditure
in key sectors (such as education, housing and roads) local authorities in
England and Wales must seek approval from the government department con¬
cerned before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each authority
receives an annual loan authorisation within which it determines what sums
to borrow and what projects to undertake. The GLC applies annually for
parliamentary sanction to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland the government department responsible for
the service also issues the appropriate loan approvals.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
and by issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may
not be quoted on the Stock Exchange. Although these bonds may be for any
period, local authorities normally issue them for one year. Local authorities also
have right of access to the Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exche¬
quer, or, in Northern Ireland, to the Government Loans Fund, for long-term
borrowing to finance a proportion of their reckonable capital payments, and
may borrow temporarily for a limited proportion of their current outstanding
loan debt.
Internal control of finance is normally exercised on behalf of the council
concerned by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial
policy of the council under constant review. (There is no statutory require¬
ment for local authorities in England and Wales to appoint a finance com¬
mittee, but they have to make proper arrangements for the administration of
their financial affairs.) For the auditing of their accounts, local authorities in
England and Wales can choose between the district auditor (appointed by the
Secretary of State for the Environment) and an approved private auditor for
the audit of some or all of their accounts. In Scotland the accounts of each
authority are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the Secretary of
State for Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern Ireland
by local government auditors appointed by the Department of Housing, Local
Government and Planning.
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales came into
effect during 1974. The system involves independent statutory Commissions
for Local Administration (one for England and one for Wales), comprising
a number of local commissioners, each responsible in a particular area of the
country for investigating citizens’ complaints of maladministration by local
authorities. The commissioners help local authority councillors to protect the
rights and interests of their constituents.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by certain public
bodies, including all local authorities.
THE FIRE SERVICES
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England

and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire service in
Northern Ireland is controlled by the Fire Authority for Northern Ireland,
which is responsible to the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
Every part of the United Kingdom is covered by a public fire brigade.
It is the statutory duty of every fire authority to make provision for fire¬
fighting purposes, and in particular to maintain a brigade of sufficient strength
to meet efficiently all normal requirements. In England and Wales (outside
Greater London) the fire authorities are the county councils; the Greater
London Council is the fire authority for London, and the Isles of Scilly have
their own fire authority. In all there are 55 local authority fire brigades. In
Scotland the local authorities are grouped in 11 areas each with a single
brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the town council of the city is
the responsible authority, each area is administered by a joint committee
representative of the councils of the counties and large burghs in the area.
Under local government reorganisation, from May 1975 there will be nine
‘regional’ and three ‘islands’ fire authorities in Scotland.
There are also fire-fighting organisations outside the local authority service,
for instance, those maintained by the Army and Air Force Departments of the
Ministry of Defence; by the Department of Industry at certain establishments;
and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility for the fire service in England and Wales and in Scotland
respectively. Central control is directed mainly towards ensuring that the
operational efficiency of brigades is maintained. To this end these ministers
have powers, under the Fire Services Acts, to make regulations on such
matters as appointments and promotions, standards of training and equip¬
ment, pensions, and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also required for
reductions in the operational establishments of fire brigades. In matters
affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and conditions of
service), each minister is advised by the appropriate Central Fire Brigades
Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the respective home departments,
representatives of the local authority associations, and of the associations
representing members of fire brigades, and other persons with special qualifi¬
cations, appointed by the minister concerned. The National Joint Council
for Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades and the National Joint Council for Chief
Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades are the negotiating bodies on
ranks, pay and conditions of service of firemen in Great Britain.
Inspectorates of fire services advise the ministers on operational and
technical matters.
Each fire authority must draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered
necessary for the provision of fire cover for its area. Establishment schemes vary
according to the fire risks in the area concerned, the strength of individual
brigades ranging from 24 whole-time and 256 part-time men in Powys, Wales,
to 4,839 whole-time men in Greater London. In the whole of England and
Wales there are about 25,200 whole-time and 17,800 part-time firemen,
operating more than 4,130 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps, turntable
ladders, water tenders, and emergency tenders and hose-laying lorries) housed
in some 1,600 fire stations. Scotland has some 3,000 whole-time and 3,000
part-time firemen, 524 fire-fighting appliances, and 355 fire stations.

It is the duty of every fire authority to buy such appliances and equipment as
may be necessary to meet efficiently all normal fire-fighting requirements in
their area. Certain items of equipment are standardised so that there is com¬
plete interchangeability when a fire is attended by men and appliances from
more than one brigade. The principal types of fire-fighting appliances are
bought by fire authorities to requirement specifications approved by the Home
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, on the advice of the respec¬
tive Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure that
minimum standards are maintained, and allow sufficient freedom of design to
meet special circumstances and encourage further developments.
Each fire authority must appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
for its fire brigade. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary
or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Central control is exercised by the chief fire officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers, who are in charge of the geographical divisions
into which most areas are divided, are responsible for mobilising their forces
to deal with outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters and if at any time an
outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is sent
from one or more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of another
fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities,
the nearest available force is sent to a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
In England and Wales, the number of fire calls in 1973 (including false
alarms and special service calls—see below) was approximately 535,000. In
Scotland the number was approximately 64,000.
Fire authorities have discretion to employ their brigades and equipment for
purposes other than fire-fighting, and they are in fact used in a variety of
emergencies (such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings,
flooding of premises, leakage of noxious gas or liquids and the rescue of people
or animals from dangerous situations) for which no charges are made. Brigades
are also used, by prior arrangement, for such purposes as emptying of swim¬
ming pools and filling of water tanks.
Estimated property losses from fire in Great Britain in 1973 amounted to
about £179 million.
The large cities and urban areas in Great Britain are served in the main by
whole-time firemen but some 60 per cent of county fire brigade establishments
is composed of part-time retained firemen who, in return for a retaining fee
and call-out and attendance fee, undertake to attend fires if called upon, and
volunteer firemen, who receive no remuneration. Many fire authorities employ
women (about 1,056 in England and Wales and 133 in Scotland in 1973) on
communications and mobilising duties, and some brigades have schemes for
the employment of junior firemen between the ages of 16 and 18 years, with a
view to their being enrolled as regular firemen at the age of 18.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at collective training schools run by the
larger fire authorities. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central
training school which is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health
Department. Management and command training is provided for the higher
and middle ranks at the Fire Service Staff College, Wotton House, near

fire prevention, practical firemanship, advancement and instructor training
for junior and middle ranks is provided at the Fire Service Technical College,
Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. Both these establishments are main¬
tained by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
Facilities for properly accredited officers from overseas fire services to study
the organisation, current training methods, appliances and equipment of the
British fire brigades are arranged by the Home Office Fire Department.
The cost of maintaining the fire service is borne by local authorities, aided by
central Government through the rate support grant (see p. 71).
Fire authorities are concerned with fire prevention under a wide range of
statutes, including the Factories Act 1961, the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act 1963 and the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (which provides for a
comprehensive system of fire precaution control in places of entertainment
and public resort and in certain kinds of residential premises). Fire authorities
are also under a statutory duty to give, when asked, advice on fire prevention,
restricting the spread of fires, and means of escape in case of fire. The enforce¬
ment and advisory duties involved are mainly carried out by the fire service;
nearly 9,000 fire inspections were made in England and Wales in 1973.
Courses in fire prevention are held continuously at the Fire Service Tech¬
nical College and all brigades have qualified fire prevention officers. Other
sources of advice on fire prevention include the various insurance companies
which advise their policyholders, and the Fire Protection Association, a non-
profit-making body established by the Fire Offices’ Committee as an advisory
centre on a nation-wide basis for industry and the general public on protection
of life and property against fire. The Fire Offices’ Committee is representative
of some, but not all, of the fire insurance companies in Britain.
Research into the different aspects of fire is undertaken by a number of
government departments and other organisations. A comprehensive programme
of research into fire brigade operations, organisation, fire-fighting appliances
and equipment is conducted by the Home Office with the help of the fire
service under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire Research of the
Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research projects are
undertaken by the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch or, under contract
to the Home Office, by other government agencies, notably the Fire Research
Station of the Department of the Environment, or by private consultants.
The main organisation undertaking the study and investigation of the
technical aspects of fire is the Joint Research Organisation of the Department
of the Environment and the Fire Offices’ Committee (with other non-member
fire insurance companies) which operate from the Fire Research Station at
Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The work of the Joint Fire Research Organisa¬
tion is supervised by a steering committee, the membership of which is drawn
from the Department of the Environment, the Fire Offices’ Committee, the
Home Office and independent sources.
The Fire Authority for Northern Ireland is responsible for fire cover for the
whole Province. The authority, whose members include representatives of the
council of the City of Belfast, and of the district councils, maintains six whole¬
time and 49 part-time stations throughout the area. Brigade establishment is
about 1,200: 420 whole-time officers and men and 800 part-time firemen,
manning 120 appliances.

Britain as a

Member
On ist January 1973, Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark,
joined the original six countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands—in the European Com¬
munity. The Treaty of Accession was signed by the applicant countries and
the original member states in January 1972.
The enlarged Community forms a trading area of over 250 million people
and accounts for some 40 per cent of world trade.
The European Communities Act became law in October 1972 and made the
legislative changes necessary to comply with Britain’s obligations under the
Treaty of Accession to make provision for the application of future Community
decisions and to exercise the rights of membership. The Act gave the force of
law in Britain to that part of Community law which is directly applicable in
member states. It also contained detailed legislation (in part repealing or
amending existing statutes) to implement Community obligations. Other
Community obligations are being met under existing powers to make sub¬
ordinate legislation, introduced as the measures become applicable.
The Treaty of Accession provides for tariffs on trade in industrial products
between Britain and the original six member countries to be progressively
reduced over a transitional period ending in 1977, when they will be abolished.
The cumulative reduction in 1975 amounts to some 60 per cent. At the end of
the transitional period the phased introduction of the common external tariff
on British imports from countries neither members of, nor having any special
arrangements with, the Community will also be complete. In addition, Britain
is progressively adopting the Community system of agricultural support, the
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), during the transitional period. Further
details of Britain’s participation in the Community are provided in the relevant
chapters.
Proposals for changes in the terms of Britain’s membership of the Com¬
munity were put forward by the Government formed in March 1974. Britain’s
proposals, which are not expected to require amendment of the Treaty of
Accession, are aimed at securing a fairer system of financing the Community
budget (see p. 79); improvements in the operation of the CAP and in trade
and aid arrangements with the Commonwealth and developing countries; and
assurances that British regional and industrial policies are not unacceptably
circumscribed by Community rules. The Government is committed when
renegotiation is complete to put the results to the British people in a general
election or a referendum. During the renegotiations, Britain is co-operating
fully in those areas of Community business not affected by them.

COMMUNITIES

Community
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties—the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic
Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. These are des¬
cribed briefly in the following pages.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established in 1952
by bringing together the coal and steel resources of the six member countries,
and formed the model for the ‘community’ approach to economic integration.
The Community is designed to ensure an orderly supply of coal and steel to
member countries, to promote the rational expansion and modernisation of
production and to provide better conditions of employment and living for the
employees in the industries. The Treaty of Paris which established the ECSC
and was signed in 1951 provided for the abolition of duties and quantitative
restrictions (or charges having the same effect) on trade in coal and steel
between member states; of discrimination by producers in prices, delivery
terms or transport rates; of any measures which hampered free choice of
supplier; and of restrictive practices resulting in the collusive sharing or
exploitation of markets. The treaty also provided for action by the Com¬
munity over a wide field of activity in the coal and steel industries, the work
of the Community being financed by a levy on production. The Community
provides funds for capital investment, research and other programmes, as
well as loans to help create new jobs in declining coal areas or where restruc¬
turing of the steel industry is taking place. Grants to assist redundant coal
and steel workers until they find new employment, or while undergoing
retraining, are also made.
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty of
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957, and aimed to promote the con¬
tinued and balanced expansion of the members’ economies by their progressive
harmonisation and integration. The preamble to the treaty included among
the basic objectives of the EEC the establishment of the foundations for a
growing unity among European peoples, the improvement of their working
and living conditions, the progressive abolition of restrictions on trade, and the
development of the prosperity of overseas countries. The initial steps towards
the attainment of these objectives were the creation of a customs union, aboli¬
tion of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and establishment of a
common external tariff, the development of a common policy for agriculture,
and the introduction of measures to establish the free movement of labour,
capital and services. At the same time, provision was made for the overseas
countries which had special links with the member countries to have an
associate status with the EEC, with preferential treatment in aid and the
development of trade. Some 21 members of the Commonwealth are among
44 developing countries negotiating new association agreements with the
Community, which will come into effect from 1st February 1975 when present
arrangements expire.
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was set up by a
second treaty signed in Rome in 1957 which provided for the co-ordinated
development of members’ atomic energy industries and of their other peaceful
nuclear activities. Euratom has worked to develop a co-ordinated research
programme (for power production, industrial and medical purposes) and to
ensure the dissemination of technical information, to facilitate the co¬
ordination of investment in the nuclear field, and to ensure a proper supply
78

of nuclear ores and fuels and wider commercial outlets. A common market for
all nuclear materials and equipment came into effect at the beginning of 1959,
with a common external tariff on imports of nuclear materials, while the
Community has established common nuclear legislation and a common control
system for nuclear materials to prevent their diversion to purposes other than
those declared. Following the enlargement of the Community, agreement was
reached in February 1973 on a further four-year research programme.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three
Communities were merged in 1967. The Community institutions, comprising
the Council of Ministers, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the Assembly
or European Parliament and others including a number dealing with specific
subjects, provide a framework (see diagram below) within which the interests
of the member states are represented and reconciled and common policies
formulated and administered. In each of the institutions Britain has a position
equal to that of France, the Federal Republic of Germany or Italy. English is
one of the official languages of the Community.

The Council of Ministers is the final decision-making body for all major
Community questions, and is the only institution whose members, usually the
foreign minister or other ministers appropriate to the subject of discussion,
directly represent each member country. Most Council decisions are taken on
the basis of a proposal by the Commission. Although provision is made in the
Treaty of Rome for certain matters to be decided by a qualified majority,
using a system of weighted voting, in practice decisions are taken on the basis
of consensus. On all matters of major importance, affecting vital national
interests, decisions are taken on the basis of unanimity.
The Community
Budget
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY 79
The Commission is responsible for formulating detailed policy proposals for
submission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the pro¬
visions of the treaties and Community measures. It is composed of 13 com¬
missioners nominated by the member governments; two are from Britain.
Each commissioner is responsible for one or more of the main Community
activities. The Commission is pledged to act in complete independence of
national or sectional interests and to formulate its proposals and administer
policy in the interests of the Community as a whole. Its proposals are made
only after extensive consultation with officials of the national governments
and with such organisations as producers, trade unions, employers’ associations
and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and of any measures taken by the Council and Commission under them,
hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Community institu¬
tions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rulings on questions
referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final appeal its pro¬
cedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest courts in member
states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Community institutions
and individuals. The Court of Justice consists of nine judges, assisted by four
advocates-general.
The Assembly or European Parliament is composed of nominated members
of the parliaments of member states, sitting according to party affiliation and
not nationality. Britain is entitled to nominate 36 members out of a total of 198.
The parliament is consulted on and debates all the major policy issues of the
Community. Its powers regarding the Community’s budget (presently limited
to examination and approval) are to be expanded and a new Court of Auditors
established. Members of the parliament may question the Council and Com¬
mission and have the power to dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds
majority.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives consists of representatives of
the member states, of ambassadorial rank, whose task is to prepare for the
meetings of the Council and perform whatever additional functions it might
delegate.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing a
cross-section of economic interests. Its members—representing employers’
organisations, trade unions and other groups—are consulted by the Council
and Commission during the formulation of policy. Britain is entitled to send
24 members out of a total of 144.
Other Community institutions include the European Agricultural Guidance
and Guarantee Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Investment
Bank, and the European Monetary Co-operation Fund.
In addition to these Community institutions, the member states have set up
the European political co-operation machinery for the consideration of impor¬
tant problems of foreign policy. The Community foreign ministers meet in
this framework four times annually. Under the foreign ministers there is a
structure of official committees. The country having the Presidency of the
Council of Ministers provides the Secretariat. Close contact is maintained with
Community institutions when this is appropriate, and decisions are made on
the basis of consensus.
All member countries contribute to a common budget for certain specific
purposes, such as agricultural support (administered by the European Agri-
8o
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, often known by its French initials,
FEOGA), the European Social Fund (used for occupational re-training and
re-adaptation programmes and programmes designed to further manpower
mobility), and administrative costs. Under the direct income system, which
came into effect for the original members in January 1971, the Community is
progressively drawing a greater proportion of the finance for this budget
directly from the revenue of customs duties and of levies on agricultural
imports. Except for a 10 per cent rebate to cover collection costs all levies on
agricultural imports are handed over to the Community; in the case of
customs duties, an increasing proportion is being handed over, so that from 1st
January 1975 all customs revenue, less 10 per cent for collection, will go to the
Community budget. The remaining proportion of the necessary income
(taking into account the new members’ contributions, which in Britain’s case
are described below) is being made up by contributions from the (six original)
member states according to a fixed scale (‘key’); eventually this will be
replaced by a proportion (equivalent to up to a 1 per cent rate) of the proceeds
of the value added tax (see p. 363).
The Treaty of Accession gives Britain a transitional period up to 1980 in
which to adopt this system. The Treaty set a percentage (or key) based on
Britain’s share of the total gross national product (GNP) of the nine countries
in the enlarged Community. This represents the proportion of the budget
which Britain would nominally have been expected to pay in the first year of
membership. During the transitional period, Britain is paying a proportion of
its nominal contribution, increasing in annual steps, from some 875 per cent
of the budget in 1973 to about 19 per cent in 1977. For the two-year period
after 1977, the British contribution is not to increase by more than a limited
amount.
In the context of the renegotiation of the terms of membership (see p. 76),
Britain is seeking arrangements to ensure that no member country is required
to bear a proportion of Community costs unreasonable in relation to its ability
to pay.
4 Justice and the Law
Sources of Law
Branches of the
Law
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single body
of law applicable universally within its limits. Scotland has its own distinctive
legal system and law courts, and although the existence of a single Parliament
for Great Britain since 1707, common opinions on broader issues, and a
common final court of appeal in civil matters have resulted in substantial
identity on many points, differences in legal procedure and practice remain.
In Northern Ireland on the other hand, legal procedure and practice have
closely resembled those of England and Wales for centuries but its enacted law
derives in certain spheres from a different source and may differ in substance
from that which operates in England and Wales. However, a large volume of
modern legislation, particularly in the social field, applies throughout the
United Kingdom.
The main sources of law in the United Kingdom are legislation, common
law and, since Britain’s accession to the European Community, Community
law, the impact of which is essentially confined to economic matters. Legisla¬
tion consists of laws made by or under the authority of Parliament and may be
Acts of Parliament, or Orders in Council, orders, rules and regulations made
by ministers under the authority of an Act of Parliament, or by-laws made by
local government or other authorities exercising powers conferred upon them
by Parliament. Common law is, broadly speaking, the ancient law of the land,
as deduced from custom and interpreted by the judges. It has never been
precisely defined or codified1 but forms the basis of the law other than where
it has been superseded by legislation.
Community law is mainly the directly applicable law of the European Com¬
munity treaties and the instruments made under them by the Community
institutions. It has not been incorporated or made identical with domestic law
but operates as a separate system side by side with that law. The English and
Scottish legal systems remain intact and their courts continue to operate as
before. In the event of conflict, however, Community law takes precedence
over domestic law. Community judgments and orders, the formal authenticity
of which has been verified by the designated national authority (the Foreign
and Commonwealth Secretary or one of his officials), may be registered and
enforced in the United Kingdom Courts. (See also European Court of Justice,
pp. 79 and 92).
A feature common to the domestic legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Broadly speaking,
criminal law is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole
while civil law is concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual
members of society between themselves.

of law.

CRIMINAL LAW
Criminal Courts
in England
and Wales
Magistrates'
Courts
The Crown
Court
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are two levels of criminal courts in England and Wales: magistrates’
courts, which try and dispose of the great majority of criminal cases and con¬
duct preliminary investigations into the more serious offences; and the Crown
Court which takes all criminal work above the level of magistrates’ courts.1
Magistrates’ courts are for the most part presided over by lay magistrates
(‘justices of the peace’), of whom there are some 21,000, and who are part-time
and unpaid. The jurisdiction of the courts is local, their areas being the counties
which are divided into petty sessional divisions so that the courts are held in
different places. The function of the courts, which consist of between two and
seven magistrates, is to hear and determine charges against people accused of
summary offences—minor offences that may legally be disposed of by the
magistrates sitting together without a jury. In addition, magistrates may also
try certain offences which would normally be tried on indictment—the more
serious offences—if the accused consents to forgo his right to trial by jury. In
fact, about 98 per cent of all criminal cases are disposed of in magistrates’
courts. Magistrates also sit as ‘examining justices’ to conduct preliminary
enquiries to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the com¬
mittal of the accused for trial in the Crown Court for a serious offence.
In inner London and a few large provincial cities there are, in addition to lay
magistrates, stipendiary magistrates (39 in London and 11 elsewhere), who are
full-time salaried lawyers, and usually sit alone. In the City of London, the
courts consist of the aldermen of the City, who are magistrates ex officio by
virtue of charters, as well as magistrates appointed individually. Benches of
lay magistrates work with the help and advice of a justices’ clerk (a barrister
or solicitor or other person with court experience).
To hear cases involving people under the age of 17 brought before the court
in care or criminal proceedings, and to deal with applications for the adoption
of children, magistrates’ courts sit as juvenile courts. Juvenile courts sit either
in a different room or building from other courts, or at a different time, and
only limited publicity is allowed. If a young person under the age of 17 is
charged jointly with someone who has attained the age of 17, the case is heard
in the ordinary magistrates’ court. If the young person is found guilty, that
court remits the case to a juvenile court, unless it wishes to dispose of the case
by discharge or fine.
The Crown Court has jurisdiction throughout England and Wales. Served by
High Court judges and circuit judges and, in addition, by recorders who sit on
a part-time basis, it sits regularly at nearly 90 centres selected, as far as
practicable, to be within daily travelling distance of the whole population.
There are three kinds of centre: first tier centres where the Crown Court
is served by both High Court and circuit judges and where the High Court
also takes civil business; second tier centres where, again, High Court and
circuit judges sit in the Crown Court; and third tier centres, where the Crown
Court is served only by circuit judges and recorders.
The jurisdiction of the Crown Court comprises trials on indictment (broadly,
for the more serious offences), the sentencing of those committed for sentence
from magistrates’ courts, and appeals from magistrates’ courts. This appellate
jurisdiction includes certain civil as well as criminal appeals. In addition the
court has a minor original civil jurisdiction.
A High Court judge, circuit judge or recorder presides at all trials of the
Crown Court with a jury. A circuit judge or recorder sits with between two

Court and magistrates’ courts.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 83
and four magistrates for appeals and committals for sentence from magistrates’
courts, and may sit with magistrates for the less important trials on indictment.
For the more important criminal trials, a High Court judge sits without any
magistrates. In the City of London, where the Crown Court continues to be
known as the Central Criminal Court, the Lord Mayor and aldermen are
entitled to sit with any High Court judge, circuit judge or recorder in any
class of work. The distribution of Crown Court business is determined by
directions given by, or on behalf of, the Lord Chief Justice of England, with
the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor; such directions allocate the various
classes of offences to High Court judges, circuit judges and recorders.
Appeals A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal against the conviction
or against the sentence to the Crown Court. Where the appeal is on a point
of law either the prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates’
court to the High Court by way of case stated—that is, by requesting the
magistrate to ‘state a case for the opinion of the High Court’. In certain cases,
an appeal by case stated may lie to the High Court from the Crown Court,
but normally appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or
against sentence, are made to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division. Appeals
against conviction may be brought to the court by right on any point of
law, and with leave of the trial judge or the court on any question of fact or
mixed fact and law. Appeals against sentence come with the leave of the court,
provided that the sentence was in the discretion of the trial judge and not
fixed by law. The Court of Appeal Criminal Division normally consists of
three judges, who may be Lords Justices of Appeal or judges of the High
Court, although the Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal usually
presides. A further appeal from the Court of Appeal Criminal Division to
the House of Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of
general public importance is involved and it appears to the court or the
House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
In addition, a prosecutor or defendant may appeal to the House of Lords
from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case. The Attorney General
may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point of law which has arisen
in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted; the court has power
to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted person revealed
without his consent.
Criminal Courts Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, when
in Scotland proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the High
Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court are tried
under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary procedure
in the less serious cases in the sheriff court, and in the justice of the peace and
burgh (or police) courts.
Burgh (or Police) The judges of burgh courts are town councillors who are serving (or have
Courts and served) in the office of magistrate of the burgh. In Glasgow stipendiary
Justice of the Peace magistrates act as judges of three of the courts. Justice of the peace courts are
Courts organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges being the justices
of the peace for the county (or county of city). When local government in
Scotland is reorganised in May 1975 (see p. 65), the burgh court will cease to
exist. The form of summary criminal courts to be adopted after that date is
being considered.

Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combina¬
tion of counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court
districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff-principal and a number of sheriffs who
act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil
jurisdiction, as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
Any one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court: the
Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session),
the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 18 Lords Commissioner of Justiciary
who are also judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edin¬
burgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns.
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment may
appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any ground
which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High Court or
upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a fit case
for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave of the
High Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard by
three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
Proceedings
Before Trial
Prosecutions
Arrest
In the majority of cases there is no restriction on the right of a private citizen
to institute criminal proceedings in England and Wales, but most prosecutions
are, in practice, initiated and conducted by the police. In some cases the consent
of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or, less fre¬
quently, a government department is required. The Director of Public
Prosecutions is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more serious cases
of indictable offences; in courts where a substantial number of cases with which
he is concerned are tried, standing counsel are appointed by the Attorney
General to appear on his behalf. At the Central Criminal Court in London,
for instance, there is a panel of counsel known as Treasury Counsel, who are
retained to prosecute in the Director’s cases.
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime
discovered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutor
concerned (the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in
the sheriff court, and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in
the justice of the peace and burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or
not to prosecute and, in the case of the Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether
to proceed summarily or to charge the accused by petitition with a view to
proceedings on indictment. There is a limited right to private prosecution by
aggrieved people.
In criminal cases in England and Wales arrest may be effected either on a
warrant issued by a judicial authority on sworn information laid before it or, in
certain cases, without warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may
release the defendant on bail, that is, he may discharge him temporarily,
subject to his entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a
reasonable sum of money, to appear in court or at a police station at an
appointed time. If the defendant cannot be brought before the magistrates’
court within a day, and his alleged offence is not serious, the police must
release him on bail. Magistrates also have discretion to grant bail, which they
exercise according to well-defined principles. If bail is refused by the magis-
Trial
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 85
trates, the defendant is entitled to apply to the Crown Court or the High
Court, and he must be informed of this right.
Once anyone has been charged with an offence, the police may not put any
further questions to him, save, in exceptional circumstances, to prevent or
minimise harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear up an ambi¬
guity in a previous answer or statement. This is laid down by the Judges’
Rules which, although they do not have the force of law, nevertheless carry
very great weight.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for his detention
are not lawful,1 may sue out a write of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him, this person then being required to appear before the court on the
day named to justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally
made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or
by someone acting on his behalf. If no court is sitting the application may be
made to a single judge who may, and in some cases must, direct that it should
come before a divisional court. An application on behalf of anyone under 18 is
always first made to a judge sitting in chambers or in private. A writ may be
refused only by a divisional court.
In Scotland the police have very broadly the same powers of arrest as have
the police in England and Wales. The Judges’ Rules do not apply, but when
anyone is arrested he must be cautioned and have the charge read over
to him. Thereafter, only his voluntary statements are used in evidence
at his trial, and the court will reject any statements made by him unless it is
satisfied that they have been fairly obtained. As in England and Wales, when
anyone is apprehended in Scotland he must be brought before the court
competent to deal with his case with the least possible delay. Where a prosecu¬
tion on indictment is contemplated, the accused is brought before a judge for
judicial examination and the judge may then commit him for trial or for further
examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for further examina¬
tion and commitment for trial.
People in custody in Scotland, other than those charged with murder or
treason, may be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the
jurisdiction of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or
by the police. Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the
discretion of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a
right of appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of
bail, by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against
the amount fixed. The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the
High Court of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and
trials must, in any event, be brought to a conclusion within no days of
committal to custody.
Since criminal law in Britain presumes the innocence of the accused until
his guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any advantage,
apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal
adviser for his defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal
aid wholly or partly at the public expense; if remanded in custody he may be
visited in prison by his legal adviser to ensure that his defence is properly
prepared. During the preparation of the case, it is customary for the prosecu-
1 Lawful grounds are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered;
detention of children by their parents or guardians; and detention expressly authorised
by Act of Parliament. The writ of habeas corpus applies in both criminal and civil cases.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
tion to inform the defence of any relevant documents which it is not proposed
to put in evidence and to disclose them if asked to do so.
Criminal trials in England and Wales are (with rare exceptions) held in open
court and the rules of evidence (which are concerned with the proof of facts)
are rigorously applied. For instance, although generally the evidence of one
uncorroborated witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, where the
evidence is that of an accomplice (or accomplices) the judge will warn the
jury of the danger of convicting on such uncorroborated evidence and a
conviction made without any such warning would not be upheld on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the prosecu¬
tion ; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of their own
free will, may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either
in person or through his counsel—the defence having the right to the last
speech at the trial. Moreover, the defendant cannot himself be questioned
unless he consents to be sworn as a witness in his own defence. The right
to cross-examine him, even when he is so sworn, is limited by law, with the
object of excluding enquiry into his character or into past offences not relevant
to the particular charge on which he is being tried. Although confessions made
in the course of previous judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they
have been made upon oath, no confessions made in any other circumstances
are admitted unless it can be proved that they were made voluntarily.
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up
the evidence for the benefit of the jury, and acquits the accused or passes
sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone decides the
issue of guilt or innocence. Verdicts need not necessarily be unanimous; in
certain circumstances the jury may bring in a majority verdict provided that,
in the normal jury of 12 people, there are not more than two dissentients.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. From a
verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right of appeal on the part of the defendant to the
appropriate court. The defence or prosecution may suggest that the mental
state of the defendant is such that he is unfit to be tried. A jury must decide
whether or not this is so. If they find in the affirmative, the defendant will be
admitted to a hospital specified by the Home Secretary.
In Scottish trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ proceedings take place
in the sheriff court, when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or
not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’
proceedings in the appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which
is to be dealt with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it
is a High Court case it is continued to the second proceedings in the High
Court for disposal.
The second proceedings are held at least nine days after the pleading pro¬
ceedings, either before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury of 15.
Evidence is led (without opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for
the prosecution and for the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the
jury. The jury may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of
which result in acquittal, or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case
the court proceeds to deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a simple
majority. Fairness to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor
exceptions, no person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two
witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which
clearly implicate the accused in the crime.

JUSTICE AND THE LAW 87
At summary trials in Scotland the accused is asked to plead to the charge at
the first calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the
case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a later date.
The main civil courts in England and Wales are the county courts, which
deal with a wide variety of civil cases, and the High Court, where those that
cannot be decided in the county courts are heard. Magistrates’ courts have
limited civil jurisdiction, as does the Crown Court—mainly in connection with
appeals from magistrates’ courts. Most appeals in civil cases go to the Court of
Appeal Civil Division and from there may go to the House of Lords.
The civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial proceed¬
ings for separation and maintenance orders, adoption and affiliation and
guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction in respect of such
matters as nuisances under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates exercise quasi-administrative functions in relation
to the licensing of public houses and of betting shops and clubs.
County courts (of which there are 337) are so located that no part of the
country is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. In the busier
centres, the courts may sit every day; in others they may sit weekly, monthly,
or at longer intervals.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the
Crown Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have
power to sit in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges
assigned to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are
mostly taken by them. The judge normally sits alone, although on the request
of a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial with a jury.
The jurisdiction of the county courts covers: actions founded upon contract
and tort (except libel, slander, and some other types of case) where the
amount claimed is not more than ^750; equity matters, such as trusts and
mortgages, where the amount does not exceed £5,000; and actions for the
recovery of land where the net annual value for rating does not exceed £1,000.
Cases outside these limits may be tried in the county court by consent of the
parties, or may in certain circumstances be transferred from the High Court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Act, landlord and tenant, and adoption. In addition undefended divorce
cases are heard and determined in county courts designated as divorce
county courts (defended cases are transferred to the High Court); outside
London bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts; and complaints
of racial discrimination brought by the Race Relations Board are heard in
selected courts where the judge sits with assessors. Where small claims are
concerned (especially those for less than £75 involving consumers), there are
special facilities for arbitration and simplified procedures.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is both original
and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases, is vested in all its
divisions. In general, however, particular types of work are assigned to a
particular division—distribution of work being governed by statute, the rules
of court and the practice of the court. For instance, the Family Division deals
with all jurisdiction of a family kind, including matrimonial cases, and cases
relating to wardship, adoption, and guardianship; while Admiralty and prize

jurisdiction rests with a specially constituted Admiralty Court of the Queen’s
Bench Division.
There are 70 High Court judges each of whom is attached to one division
on appointment but may be transferred to any other division during his
term of office. The Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of Appeal and
of the Chancery Division—the administration of the Chancery Division being
the responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor. The
Queen’s Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England,
who ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the Family
Division is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High Court
sits at the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings of the court are held at 23 places
which are known as first tier centres.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
divisional courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of
the appropriate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates’ courts lie to a
divisional court of the Family Division of the High Court. Affiliation appeals
are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from decisions of the licensing
and betting licensing committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High Court
and the county courts are heard in the Court of Appeal Civil Division and
may (with leave of the court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of
Lords, which is the ultimate court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal Civil Division are the Lord
Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and
the Master of the Rolls; the ordinary members are 14 Lords Justices of
Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the ten Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals
(which normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative
chamber), but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit.
The president of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor,
and proceedings take the form of the normal proceedings of the House of
Lords: judgments are given in the form of speeches to a motion, and the
decision of the House is taken by a vote.
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to English county courts, and the
Court of Session.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff,
against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal or
directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and
has sole jurisdiction in divorce and certain other actions. The court is divided
into two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being presided
over by the Lord President and the second division by the Lord Justice Clerk.
From the Inner House an appeal may lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land
Court

Proceedings
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 89
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary enquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required. The
most common form of proceedings is an action commenced in the High Court
by a writ of summons served on the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies
the defendant that the plaintiff has a claim against him and states the nature
of the claim. If the defendant intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an appear¬
ance’ by informing the court to this effect and documents setting out the precise
question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court. County
court proceedings are initiated by a ‘plaint’ served on the defendant by the
court; subsequent procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree for divorce can be obtained only after a hearing in court, whether
or not the case is defended. Other civil proceedings, because they are a private
matter, can usually be abandoned or compromised at any time without leave
of the court—the parties to a dispute being able to settle their differences
through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that
are brought to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases
involving claims for defamation, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution,
when either party may insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the
defendant may claim this right. In trials where a jury is present, the jury is
responsible for deciding questions of fact (as in criminal trials) and also the
amount of damages to be awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts may
be accepted.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by
seizure of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order
requiring an employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction
from the debtor’s wages). Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant
to do something or to refrain from doing something may result in imprison¬
ment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may be
effected only on a warrant of the court.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (the barrister’s fees, solicitor’s
charge, court fees and other disbursements) are in the discretion of the court.
Normally, the court orders the costs to be paid by the party losing the
action.
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of
a writ or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer
seeks, a statement of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a
statement of the legal propositions upon which the pursuer maintains that he
is entitled to the remedy which he seeks. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences to it. In
ordinary sheriff court actions ‘entering appearance’ is followed by the ‘tabling
of the cause’, which involves a formal appearance in court by solicitors, or, in
some cases, by the parties to the dispute. In summary and small debt actions
the defender is simply given notice of the date on which the action will be
heard. It is much more common in Scotland than in England and Wales to
have legal debates in court as to the competency or relevancy of the written
pleadings prior to the proof. In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case,

including any matrimonial case, at any time, but, where abandonment is
sought after the commencement of the proof or trial, only with leave of the
court. Trial by jury in civil actions in Scotland is more common than in
England and Wales, being the usual form of procedure in actions for damages
for personal injuries in the Court of Session. In the sheriff court it is relatively
rare, being confined to actions between employer and employee.
The superior courts in Northern Ireland comprise the Supreme Court of
Judicature (consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal)
and the Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court, the superior court of
first instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s Bench
Division (including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings) and the
circuit courts and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, as president, and
four judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate tribunal, is constituted
of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). The county courts exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction
and are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are nine (two
of them having a title of recorder—of Belfast and of Londonderry). The
establishment has been proposed of a central criminal court for the Belfast
region, to which the original criminal jurisdiction of county courts lying within
the region should be transferred. At least four sittings of the court are held
annually in each division. Petty session courts are composed of one resident
magistrate (who corresponds to a stipendiary magistrate in England and
Wales) who normally sits alone. Juvenile courts, which deal with children or
young persons between the ages of 10 and 17 unless charged jointly with an
adult or committed for jury trial in the case of a more serious offence, are
composed of one resident magistrate and two lay members, one of whom must
be a woman.
The Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland, who is responsible
to the Attorney General, has functions which include the initiation of criminal
proceedings in certain circumstances, representing the Crown in criminal
actions, and prosecuting offences against statutory provisions on behalf of
government departments. The director also has functions in relation to the
granting of bail.
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears to
have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the cause
is unknown, and in certain other circumstances. Such cases may be brought to
the notice of the local coroner (who must be a barrister, a solicitor, or a legally
qualified medical practitioner, of not less than five years’ standing, appointed
by the county council or, in London, by the Greater London Council) by
medical practitioners, by the police, by various public authorities or by
members of the public, and it is his duty to hold an enquiry into how, when
and where the deceased died. He may hold an inquest in court for this purpose,
and he must do so if he has reason to believe that the deceased has died a
violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which
an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. If the coroner has
reason to suspect that the death was due to murder, suicide, manslaughter, or
infanticide, or was caused by an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle
on the public highway, he must summon a jury.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
enquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may

report the result of his enquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown
Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
In Northern Ireland coroners must, on appointment, be either barristers-at-
law of not less than five years’ standing practising in Northern Ireland or
practising solicitors of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland
of not less than five years’ standing.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a
rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
with a group of people or with another individual; consequently there has
been a substantial growth during the past 30 years of administrative tribunals
with a regular or permanent existence and the function of deciding or adjudi¬
cating in disputes arising under regulatory or welfare legislation. Such tribunals
include those concerned with: land and property; national insurance; supple¬
mentary benefits and family allowances; the National Health Service; trans¬
port; taxation; and many which do not fall into any specified group. Their
constitution follows a fairly general pattern: usually they consist of an uneven
number of persons so that a majority decision can be reached; members are
usually appointed by the minister concerned with the subject but other
authorities (for instance, the Lord Chancellor) have the power of appointment
in appropriate cases; the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord President of the Court
of Session in Scotland, makes appointments in most cases where a lawyer
chairman or member is required; and, with some exceptions, members of
tribunals hold office for a period specified in the warrant or instrument by
which they are appointed.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as the
General Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee administered by the
Solicitors Acts 1957-65, but these are entirely different in constitution from
the statutory tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Appeals from all the more important tribunals may be made, at least on a
point of law, to the High Court, or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An
appeal may also lie to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of
the Crown or to an independent referee. An advisory body known as the
Council on Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord
Advocate) exercises general supervision1 over tribunals and reports on parti¬
cular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish
Committee of the Council.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board consists of a chairman of wide
legal experience and eight other legally qualified members appointed by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation
with the Lord Chancellor. Its function is to entertain applications for ex gratia
payments of compensation, in certain circumstances, to victims of crimes of
violence in Great Britain or on a British vessel or aircraft. Compensation,
which is assessed on the basis of common law damages and usually takes the
form of a lump sum payment, amounted to over £4 million in 1973-74. Over

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
£19 million was awarded in compensation between August 1964 (when the
scheme began) and the end of March 1974. A review of the working of the
scheme is in progress.
In Northern Ireland there is statutory provision for compensation for
criminal injuries and also for malicious damage to property.
Courts Martial Courts martial have statutory jurisdiction over serving members of the armed
forces and, in certain circumstances, their dependants and other civilians who
accompany them outside the United Kingdom. Courts martial may not deal
with certain serious offences if committed in the United Kingdom. These
include: treason; murder; manslaughter; treason-felony; rape; and aiding,
abetting, counselling or procuring suicide. Civil offences committed in the
United Kingdom by members of the armed forces are also normally dealt with
in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and a number of serving
officers) may be convened by an authorised officer. A judge advocate is
appointed to sit with the court in more serious cases brought under the
Army and Air Force Acts (and at every trial brought under the Naval Discipline
Act) to advise upon law and procedure and, in the former case, to sum up the
evidence. The judge advocate in the case of the Army and the Air Force is a
civilian and a barrister appointed by the Office of the Judge Advocate General.
In the case of the Navy he is a legally qualified serving officer appointed by the
convening authority.
Appeals lie to the Courts Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or to the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
Under the European treaties, questions of the validity and interpretation of
Community law may be referred by the courts of the United Kingdom to the
European Court (see p. 79), and must be so referred when there is no judicial
remedy under national law, that is, when the question arises in a final court of
appeal, such as the House of Lords. In a case of this kind, the European Court
makes a preliminary ruling, which is binding on the national court on that
particular point. However, it remains with the national court to make a
substantive decision on the whole issue.
ADMINISTRATION In the United Kingdom the judiciary is independent of the executive and is
therefore not subject to ministerial direction or control in regard to the
judgment of the courts. Responsibility for administrative matters in England
and Wales, when it does not rest with the courts themselves, lies partly with
the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary; in Scotland it lies
with the Secretary of State. In England the Lord Chancellor is concerned with
the composition of all courts, both criminal and civil, with parts of criminal
procedure and with everything relating to civil law, and the Home Secretary
with criminal law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders, part of the
process of trying them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The Prime
Minister is concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the
Crown the highest judicial appointments. The Secretary of State for the
Environment is responsible for providing accommodation for all the superior
courts, except the Central Criminal Court which is the special responsibility
of the City of London.

The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature (the Court

officers of the court are in the hands of the Lord Chancellor. The Lord
Chancellor is a member of the Supreme Court, the Crown Court and the
Matrimonial Causes Rule Committees; and he appoints the County Court
Rule Committee, and has power to alter or disallow the rules made by it.
The Lord Chancellor’s responsibility for the administration of the High
Court, the Crown Court and the county courts is exercised through a unified
court administrative service organised on a circuit basis under a senior officer,
known as a ‘circuit administrator’. Two High Court judges, known as ‘presid¬
ing judges’, are assigned to each circuit; these judges are not concerned with
administrative detail and continue their normal judicial work, but they
exercise a supervisory and advisory function in the circuit, with particular
responsibility for the allocation of work among all the judges. The Lord
Chancellor has also appointed 18 advisory committees, consisting of lawyers,
magistrates, police officers, and representatives of local authorities, the police
and probation services, and the press, to advise him on such matters as he
may refer to them on the running of the courts. These committees normally
meet under the chairmanship of the circuit administrator.
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves,
chiefly through committees known as magistrates’ courts committees (the com¬
mittee of magistrates in inner London), but the local authorities, with financial
assistance from the Government, are responsible for meeting their costs, and
the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general oversight, has certain specific
responsibilities, including the approval of boundary changes to petty sessional
division areas, approval of the appointment of justices’ clerks, and deciding
disputes on financial matters.
In Scotland the Secretary of State appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the composition,
staffing and general organisation of the sheriff courts. The Lord Advocate
appoints the members of the Scottish Law Commission.
In Northern Ireland the administration of the courts is the responsibility
of the United Kingdom Parliament. The Northern Ireland Office is responsible
for the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions
courts.
The operation of the law requires the participation of judges, with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests, and of the
officers of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an adminis¬
trative (and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are
attached. Barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are entrusted
with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute are also involved
because, although the law allows an individual to conduct his own case if he
wishes, most people prefer to be legally represented.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the
advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary. In
England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the
President of the Family Division and the Lords Justices who are the judges of
the Court of Appeal—are made on the recommendation of the Prime Minister,
while the Lord Chancellor recommends the appointment of High Court

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
judges, circuit judges and recorders and the metropolitan and other stipendi¬
ary magistrates. Lay magistrates are appointed on behalf of the Crown by the
Lord Chancellor,1 who is advised by local advisory committees.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord
Justice Clerk. Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies
with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible
for the appointment and removal of justices of the peace.
In Northern Ireland the appointment of county court judges and magistrates
is, broadly speaking, a matter for the Lord Chancellor.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor
who, as well as being head of the judiciary and speaker of the House of Lords,
is a leading member of the Government in power. With the exception of
lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed from practising barristers,
advocates or solicitors and neither their training nor their career is in any way
dictated by the state. Lay magistrates need no legal qualifications, being
appointed for their qualities of integrity and understanding and as broadly
representative of the community which they serve. On appointment, however,
they give an undertaking to complete a period of basic training, so that they
may obtain a sufficient knowledge of the law, including the rules of evidence,
and may understand the nature and purpose of sentencing. A special com¬
mittee advises the Lord Chancellor on training policies. In certain cir¬
cumstances (for instance, in cases of misconduct or proven incapacity) judges
of the inferior courts in England and Wales and Northern Ireland may be
removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor, and in Scotland, subject
to specified conditions, by the Secretary of State on a report prepared at his
instance by the Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice
Clerk. In order to safeguard and perpetuate the independence of the judiciary
from the executive, however, superior judges in England and Wales and
Northern Ireland (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet Minister,
changes with the Government) are subject to a power of removal only by the
Sovereign on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland
there is no statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or
High Court of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation
would be required to effect such a dismissal.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to a criminal or civil court consists of
12 persons (except in county courts, where it consists of eight persons). In
Scotland the jury consists of 15 persons in criminal cases, 12 persons in civil
cases in the Court of Session and seven in civil cases in the sheriff court. In
Northern Ireland the jury numbers 12 in ordinary criminal2 and seven in civil
cases. Jury service in England and Wales is determined by a qualification
based on the electoral register: all citizens between the ages of 18 and 65,
subject to a five-year residence qualification, are liable for jury service. How¬
ever, people following certain occupations are either ineligible or entitled to
claim excusal, and certain persons with criminal records are disqualified. Jury
service in Scotland, for which citizens between the ages of 21 and 60 are liable,
is based on a low property qualification. In Northern Ireland it is also based
1 Except in Lancashire, where the Chancellor of the Duchy acts on behalf of the Crown
in this matter.
2 Under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, trials of ‘scheduled
offences’ (generally speaking, offences involving terrorism) are heard by a single judge,
sitting without a jury.
The Legal
Profession
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 95
on a property qualification but proposals for a system similar to that in
England and Wales are being considered.
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive.
In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors (in Scotland, five)
changed without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object
for cause shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the
jury have been sworn, they are protected by law from interference of any kind.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and at fatal accident inquiries in Scotland, a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
Juries in this instance consist of from seven to eleven jurors. In England and
Wales a coroner may accept a majority verdict provided that the minority
consists of not more than two. At fatal accident inquiries in Scotland a simple
majority is sufficient. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner in
England and Wales to decide whether objects of gold or silver found in the
ground are ‘treasure trove’.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Each branch of the profession
performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake legal business for lay clients,
while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through solicitors and
present cases in the higher courts—though certain functions are common to
both.
To become a barrister in England a student must have reached an accepted
educational standard, have passed certain examinations and attended certain
courses prescribed by the Council of Legal Education. He must also have
become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Lincoln’s Inn, the Inner
Temple, the Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn—where he must keep a number
of terms. He may then be called to the Bar, but is normally not allowed to
practise until he has kept further terms and completed six months’ pupilage
with a practising barrister of at least five years’ standing. Most higher judicial
offices are filled from the ranks of senior barristers (known as Queen’s
Counsel). The Senate of the Inns of Court and the Bar, the governing body of
the profession, comprises representatives of each Inn of Court and representa¬
tives elected by barristers themselves. The latter also constitute an autonomous
Bar Council charged with maintaining the standards and independence of the
profession and improving its services.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable
by the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organisa¬
tion of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his profes¬
sional career. The term of articles lasts for two, two and a half, or five years,
depending upon the educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk
must pass the necessary examinations prescribed by The Law Society and,
unless he has been a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is
generally required to attend a course of studies at a recognised law school.
Once a solicitor is qualified, he may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo much the same
training. While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of
Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional
examinations, candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including
the necessary subjects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective
96 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
advocate must, thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months
or of 12 months depending on whether or not he has been granted exemption
from nine months’ training) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine
months’ pupilage with a practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must
serve an apprenticeship of two years in a solicitor’s office before he can begin
his professional career.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
LEGAL AID
AND ADVICE
Legal Aid in
Civil
Proceedings
Legal Aid in
Criminal
Proceedings
Britain’s legal aid scheme helps people of limited means and resources to meet
the cost of work normally done by a lawyer. Under the scheme lawyers’ costs
and expenses are paid out of a state legal aid fund drawn from three sources:
contributions which assisted people may be required to pay; costs and damages
recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from the Exchequer.
Free legal aid is available to people whose disposable income does not exceed
^375 a Year> and whose disposable capital is £250 or less, but, if either of these
figures is exceeded the applicant must pay a contribution towards the cost of
the proceedings. The qualifying limits for this contributory aid are a disposable
income not exceeding ^1,175 a year and a disposable capital of less than £1,200
or such larger figures as may be prescribed.1 An assisted person is liable for a
maximum contribution towards the cost of his case of a third of the sum by
which his disposable income exceeds £350 a year, together with the amount by
which his disposable capital exceeds £125 or such larger figures as may be
prescribed.
The legal aid schemes are run by The Law Society, The Law Society of
Scotland and The Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the
general guidance respectively, of the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State
for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
An applicant for legal aid must show that he has reasonable grounds for
asserting or disputing a claim. If his application is successful, he is entitled
to select from a panel a solicitor (who, if necessary, instructs counsel), and the
case is then conducted in the ordinary way, except that no money passes
between the assisted person and his solicitor—payments being made in and
out of the legal aid fund. The costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses
against an unassisted opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if
the court so orders, be met out of the fund. Local committees have the right
to refuse assistance if it appears unreasonable that the applicant should receive
it in the particular circumstances of a case; both solicitors and counsel have a
duty to review the case at each stage to see that it is not being pursued un¬
reasonably at the public expense. Legal aid is not available for proceedings in
tribunals (except the Lands Tribunals and the Commons Commissioners),
coroners’ courts and cases where redress is sought for alleged defamation.
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made
by the court concerned if it appears to be in the interest of justice and that a
defendant’s means are such that he requires financial help in meeting the costs
1 Assessments of disposable income and capital are made by the Supplementary Benefits
Commission and are governed by regulations which allow for deductions from gross
income for maintenance of dependants, interest on loans, income tax, rent and other
matters for which a person may reasonably provide out of income, and deductions for
the value of a person’s house, furniture and other household effects from his capital.

of the proceedings in which he is involved. An order must be made when a
person is committed for trial on a charge of murder or applies for leave to
appeal from the Court of Appeal Criminal Division or the Courts Martial
Appeal Court to the House of Lords. No person can be sentenced for the first
time to a term of imprisonment, borstal training or detention in a detention
centre unless he is legally represented, or has been refused, or has failed to
apply for, legal aid after having been informed of his right to do so.
Broadly similar arrangements exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but
in Scotland there is in addition a duty solicitor system which enables people in
custody to be represented on first appearing in court without any inquiry into
their means.
Under provisions for legal advice and assistance, introduced in Great Britain
in 1973, a person may obtain help on any matter normally within a solicitor’s
practice, except for taking steps in court or tribunal proceedings (for the former
legal aid is available in the ways outlined on p. 96, although magistrates’ courts
and county courts, and sheriff courts in Scotland, have power to appoint a
solicitor to represent a person appearing before them). This help includes
giving advice, writing letters, drafting wills, obtaining counsel’s opinion and
visiting a police station or prison. A solicitor may act for a client until his costs
and expenses reach a total of £25, but authority may be obtained from The
Law Society for this limit to be exceeded. A person seeking help has to give the
solicitor brief details about his income and savings to show that he comes
within the financial limits allowed by the scheme. People with disposable
capital of up to ^250 who are also receiving either supplementary benefits (see
p. 128) or family income supplement (see p. 122) are within the financial
limits; other people are also eligible provided their disposable capital does not
exceed £250 and their weekly disposable income does not exceed ^24*50 (in
this case a small contribution may be payable).
Similar provisions are proposed for Northern Ireland.
The duty of keeping the law under review in order to ensure that it meets the
needs of modern society lies, in England and Wales with the Law Reform
Committee, the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission,
and in Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform
Committee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing commit¬
tees of judges and lawyers, appointed respectively by the Lord Chancellor and
the Home Secretary, to examine such aspects of the civil and criminal law
as may be referred to them by the appropriate minister. The Law Commission
is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high standing, charged with
the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its systematic development and
reform, including the possibility of codification, the elimination of anomalies,
the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments, and the reduction of the
number of separate enactments. The Commission submits programmes of
reform to the Lord Chancellor and may recommend further examination of
specified topics by itself or by some other body, such as a Royal Commission
or the Law Reform Committee or Criminal Law Revision Committee. The
Lord Chancellor may also ask the Commission to prepare draft Bills or to
advise government departments. In the course of its work the Commission
seeks information about the legal systems of other countries in so far as this
may assist its work. The Scottish Law Commission has a constitution similar to
that of the English body and similar functions in relation to the law of Scot¬
land. It reports to the Lord Advocate.

THE POLICE SERVICE
POLICE IN
GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
Police
Authorities
and Chief
Constables
The police service of Great Britain is organised in a number of large forces
linked with local government and subject to the influence and eventual control
of the Home Secretary in England and Wales and the Secretary of State for
Scotland in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, it is organised in a single force.
There are 63 regular police forces in Great Britain: 43 in England and Wales
and 20 in Scotland. Each police force is responsible for a separate police area,
but there is constant co-operation between them.
In England and Wales the forces are defined according to area of responsibility:
outside London most counties have their own forces, though in the interests of
efficiency several have combined forces; the Metropolitan Police Force is
responsible for an area within a radius of about 15 miles (24 kilometres) from
Charing Cross, but excluding the City of London (for which there is a
separate force). In Scotland the four burgh forces, 15 combined forces, and
one county force will be replaced in May 1975 by six regional forces and two
combined forces.
The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is over 111,000, the
size of individual police forces depending on the area and population which
they serve. The strength of the Metropolitan Police Force is about 21,000.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are constabularies maintained
by the statutory transport and other public authorities, and by the Ministry
of Defence.
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority. In the
counties of England and Wales the authority is a police committee consisting
of the local councillors and magistrates in a proportion of two to one. Com¬
bined police authorities, which also consist of councillors and magistrates,
contain representatives from each constituent area covered by an amalgamation
scheme.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Sec¬
retary. In the City of London the Court of Common Council is the police
authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all
police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the county is the county council; in
the burghs it is the town council. From May 1975 the police authority will be
the regional or island council. Where there are combined forces there is a joint
police committee.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force for the area for which it is responsible. To enable it to
carry out this duty, it is empowered, subject to the approval of the Home
Secretary or Secretary of State for Scotland, to appoint the chief constable
and the deputy and assistant chief constables of the force, and fix the authorised
establishment. It may also retire the chief constable in the interests of efficiency,
if the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees, and
must keep itself informed of the way in which chief constables deal with
complaints from the public against police officers. In addition, police authori¬
ties, with the consent of the Secretary of State, provide the buildings and
equipment needed for their forces. In the Metropolitan Police area the chief
officer of police and his immediate subordinates are appointed by the Crown
on the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police

forces and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below
deputy or assistant chief constable; they are, however, generally answerable
to the police authorities on matters of efficiency, and are required to submit
a written annual report.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who have a
general responsibility for the preservation of law and order throughout Great
Britain, are concerned both in the overall organisation of the police service
and in its administration and operation. In this regard, they not only approve
the appointment of chief constables, but may require a police authority to
retire a chief constable in the interests of efficiency, call for a report from a
chief constable on any matters relating to the policing of his area, or cause
a local inquiry to be held. They are also empowered to make regulations as
to the government, administration and conditions of service in police forces.
The police regulations cover such matters as rank; qualifications for appoint¬
ment, promotion and retirement; discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay and
allowances; and uniform and equipment. Some of these are first negotiable
on the Police Council (a negotiating body on which are represented the police
authorities, police staff associations and ministers); the others are discussed on
representative advisory bodies together with any general questions affecting
the police service.
The Home Secretary is advised on all matters concerning police efficiency
by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and five Inspectors of
Constabulary. The inspectors are individually responsible for the inspection
of a number of forces, and must be satisfied of their continuing efficiency
through formal annual inspections and by maintaining close touch on all
matters with the forces for which they are responsible. The inspectors report
to the Home Secretary on the condition of all the forces in England and Wales,
with the exception of the Metropolitan Police Force. The Secretary of State
for Scotland is similarly assisted by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Con¬
stabulary in Scotland and one other Inspector of Constabulary.
The income of police authorities derives from the central Government,
from a police rate levied on the ratepayers of the area, and from various other
local sources. The Government’s contribution, which (except in the case of the
City of London police, where it is 33^- per cent) is a 50 per cent grant of
approved expenditure, is conditional on the Home Secretary or the Secretary
of State for Scotland being satisfied that the force is being efficiently ad¬
ministered and maintained.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages
of 19 and 30, and to women in England and Wales between the ages of 19 and
35, and in Scotland between 19 and 30. An individual chief constable may
approve appointment of especially suitable older men and women.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police area, are: chief constable, assistant chief constable, chief super¬
intendent, superintendent, chief inspector, inspector, sergeant and constable.
In the Metropolitan Police area the chief officer is the Commissioner of
Police of the Metropolis. He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four
assistant commissioners. Next in rank are deputy assistant commissioners, and
then commanders; from chief superintendent the ranks are the same as in
the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are the same as in the
regions except that the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police and the
second in command is an assistant commissioner.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have
their own associations which can make representations to ministers or to
police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their members.
Police cadets are recruited from among boys and girls1 between 16 and 18^
years of age. They have no police powers but in addition to their educational
studies and physical and adventure training, are given instruction in elementary
police work. During the latter part of their training they do practical police
work on attachment to the local force. Cadet training is designed to prepare
boys and girls for a career in the police service upon attaining the minimum
age for constables.
In order to release as many police officers as possible for operational duties
police authorities employ a large number of civilians (about 30,000) on
administrative (pay, records, finance, and other general subjects) and other
duties (fingerprint, scenes of crime and control room work). Some civilian staff
are also employed on catering and domestic duties.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are about 7,000) are extensively employed to
discharge specified duties connected with road traffic and vehicles, normally
undertaken by the police. In this connection they may be authorised to serve
fixed penalty notices2 for minor offences to which the fixed penalty system
applies; to man police car-pounds (except in Scotland); to enforce the vehicle
excise laws; and to obtain the name and address of people thought to have
committed a traffic offence of the type with which traffic wardens are com¬
petent to deal. They may also be employed to direct traffic, to act as parking
attendants at street parking places, and as school-crossing patrols, if the police
agree. Traffic wardens remain under the control of the chief constable of the
force to which they are attached, whatever duties they may perform.
Each of the regular police forces has an attachment of special constables, who
are volunteers willing to perform police duties without pay in their spare time.
In England and Wales the function of special constables is to act as auxiliaries
to the regular force when required. In Scotland they are employed only in
emergencies although they may be assigned for duty for training purposes.
A police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office
and exercises his powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by
common law, by virtue of his office. He is an agent of the law of the land, not
of the police authority nor of the central Government and, although his chief
officer of police has a vicarious liability for any wrongful act he may commit
in the performance of his functions as a constable, he himself may also be sued
in respect of his own wrongful act.
The many functions of a police officer as a constable range from the pro¬
tection of people and property, road or street patrolling and traffic control to
crime prevention, criminal investigation and the apprehension of offenders.
The main departments in all police forces are the uniform department and
the criminal investigation department. Many forces also have specialised
departments, including traffic departments, river police (in districts which

include long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted branch (for main¬
taining order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
In all aspects of police work, the application of scientific aids has reached
an advanced stage: about £20 million is spent annually on police equipment,
including about £3 million on radio communications; the police have some
30,000 personal radio sets operational; and a police computer project is
being developed for rationalising the keeping of records and speeding up the
dissemination of information.

Services
A number of common services are provided by the central government depart¬
ments for the benefit of all forces to supplement those provided by the police
authorities for their own use and by communal arrangements made between
the forces themselves. The most important of these services are: training
services, which in England and Wales provide training centres for recruit
training and a central police college for higher training, and in Scotland a
central police college with courses of recruit training and higher training; a
forensic science service in England and Wales which provides eight regional
laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory); telecom¬
munications services, including depots, which in England and Wales supply
and maintain wireless equipment for the police; and central and provincial
criminal records which are available to all forces. In addition, regional crime
squads, consisting of teams of experienced detectives from several forces,
operating under a committee of chief constables, are employed in England and
Wales to investigate major crimes involving enquiries in more than one police
area. The Scottish Crime Squad assists police forces in Scotland in the investi¬
gation and prevention of crime and in the collection and maintenance of in¬
formation concerning criminals. Arrangements are also made for everyday
assistance by one force to another.
There are three inter-related branches of the Home Office Police Department
devoted to scientific research and medium- and long-term planning. The Police
Scientific Development Branch and the Police Research Services Branch,
which are staffed by senior police officers, are concerned with operational
research into police methods and the development of equipment for police
forces throughout Great Britain. The Police Management and Planning Group,
which is composed mainly of economists and accountants, is responsible for the
development of a planning-programming-budgeting system for the police, and
for the planning of police resources.
Services provided by the Metropolitan Police Force for other forces include
(1) the publication of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people
wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without charge
to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Common¬
wealth and foreign forces; (2) the organisation and control of the special branch
of the criminal investigation department at New Scotland Yard, whose duties
include the protection of royalty, some ministers and distinguished foreign
visitors; and (3) the carrying out of extradition orders made by the courts. The
Metropolitan Police Force is also available, on request, to assist any other
police force in England and Wales in criminal investigations. Similarly, the
services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by the Metropolitan Police Force
and the City of London Police, are available throughout Great Britain for the
investigation of serious company frauds. The National Central Bureau, which

handles the business of the International Criminal Police Organisation
(Interpol) on behalf of Great Britain and the British dependencies, is part of
the Metropolitan Police Force. For certain of these services, the Metropolitan
Police Force receives an additional Exchequer grant.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) operates under the direction of a
chief constable who is responsible to the Police Authority for Northern
Ireland.
The RUC, which has a strength of nearly 4,500 (all ranks), operates through¬
out the Province on a divisional basis. Ranks, conditions of service, pay and
general duties follow closely on the lines of the police service in Great Britain.
The Police Authority, which consists of a chairman, a vice-chairman and
between 14 and 20 other members, is responsible for the maintenance of an
adequate and efficient police service.
The RUC is assisted in its police duties by the Royal Ulster Constabulary
Reserve, the members of which receive nominal remuneration. While on duty,
they have the same powers, privileges and duties as may be exercised by, or are
conferred upon, members of the regular force.
PENAL SYSTEMS
The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is intended to lie in the fear of detection, public trial and possibility
of punishment rather than in the severity of the punishment itself. In England
and Wales the Home Secretary is assisted by an Advisory Council on the Penal
System, which makes recommendations on such matters relating to the pre¬
vention of crime and the treatment of offenders as the Home Secretary may
refer to it. In Scotland the Scottish Council on Crime keeps under review
questions relating to the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders in
Scotland, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Methods current in British penal practice include imprisonment and, for
certain categories of young offender, other forms of custodial treatment (see
p. 109). Imprisonment is increasingly being seen as the last resort in dealing
with those who break the law; wherever possible and appropriate for the
safety of the public and the punishment of the individual, sentencing offenders
to treatment outside prison is regarded as preferable to custodial penalties.
Offenders may, for example, be put on probation; ordered to perform a
specified number of hours of unpaid service to the community; fined; given an
absolute or (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional discharge
for up to three years, or ‘bound over’— that is to say, required to pledge
money, with or without sureties, ‘to keep the peace and be of good behaviour’.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, they may be given a suspended
sentence, which means that the sentence will not actually be served unless a
further offence punishable with imprisonment is committed within a specified
period (maximum two years). If a crime is committed within the period of a
suspended sentence, the sentence will normally take effect and a further
sentence may be imposed. An offender who is given a suspended sentence of
over six months may, in England and Wales, be made subject to a supervision
order for all or part of the period during which the sentence is suspended.
An offender may also have his sentence deferred for up to six months with his
consent (this is intended to enable a court to arrive at the most appropriate
Administrative
Authorities
JUSTICE AND THE LAW IO3
sentence, taking into account the offender’s conduct after, for instance, some
expected change in his circumstances).
The courts may order an offender to pay compensation for any personal
injury, loss or damage resulting from his offence and, in certain circumstances,
may order the forfeiture of property used, or intended for use, in the commis¬
sion of a crime. In the case of major crimes against property the Crown Court
has power to make a criminal bankruptcy order against the offender, which can
form the basis of bankruptcy proceedings against him. The Crown Court also
has power to disqualify from driving an offender convicted of one of the more
serious crimes, if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
The mandatory penalty for murder in the United Kingdom is imprisonment
for life. This is also the maximum penalty for manslaughter and certain other
offences, including rape, robbery with violence, and arson.
Except in cases of murder (and of one or two other rarely prosecuted
offences), for which the penalty is prescribed by law, the court which tries the
offender has discretion to select the penalty that it considers most suitable in
the light of the nature and gravity of the offence and the information available
about the character and needs of the offender. In certain cases this discretion is
modified by statutory provisions designed for the most part to ensure that
prison sentences are kept to a minimum. In England and Wales, no offender
under the age of 17 may be sentenced to imprisonment; for those aged 17 and
under 21, prison sentences must be for less than six months or for more than
three years except in the case of an offender who has served a sentence of
borstal training or a prison sentence of not less than six months, who may be
sent to prison for 18 months or more. In Scotland no offender under 21 may be
sent to prison; in cases involving young people aged 16 and under 21, where
neither borstal training nor detention in a detention centre is thought appro¬
priate, detention in a young offenders’ institution may be ordered. (For special
sentences for young offenders, see p. 108.) In England and Wales a person
who has not previously served a custodial sentence of a particular kind may
not be sentenced to custodial treatment of that kind unless he is legally rep¬
resented or has chosen not to be, and unless the court is satisfied that no
other sentence will suffice. On the other hand, special sentences of somewhat
longer duration (extended sentences) may be imposed on persistent offenders.
In Northern Ireland special temporary procedures are provided for dealing
with people suspected of terrorism, but there are safeguards for the individual
based on referral to independent legal commissioners with a further right of
appeal to a tribunal.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is the minister generally respon¬
sible for legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting
statistical and other information about the operation of the penal system,
for keeping penal methods under review, and for bringing information about
these methods to the attention of the courts. He has specific responsibilities
for promoting the efficiency of the probation service, and for providing, main¬
taining and managing prisons, borstals, detention centres, remand centres and
attendance centres. Prison policy is carried out by the Prison Department of
the Home Office through the agency of the prison service which operates under
a director-general and includes a headquarters organisation, regional directors,
the governors and staff of the penal establishments and members of particular
professions, such as medical officers, chaplains and social workers.
Reports to the Home Secretary on the administration of institutions in the
penal system are made by boards of visitors appointed by the Home Secretary,
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
not less than two members of which must be magistrates (see p. 94). The other
functions of these bodies include acting as the superior disciplinary authority
for reports of a more serious nature against inmates and providing an inde¬
pendent channel of complaint for any inmates having a grievance. The boards
of visitors also advise on the release on licence of the inmates of borstals. The
work of boards helps to preserve local interest, and is voluntary.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. In Scotland the system is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland
of the Northern Ireland Office.
The aims of the prison service are briefly to provide for the detention of those
committed to custody under the law in conditions generally acceptable to
society and to develop constructive methods of treatment and training designed
to lead to the prisoner’s rehabilitation and reform. To this end prisoners are
classified into groups, according to their record, character, potentialities and
the risk they present to security, and assigned, so far as circumstances permit,
to the establishment best suited to their needs. Untried prisoners are entitled
to privileges not granted to convicted prisoners. As far as practicable, un¬
convicted prisoners are separated from convicted prisoners, and those under 21
are separated from those over that age.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known
as ‘local prisons’; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be
open or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons. Since 1970
there has been a downward trend in the number of people serving sentences in
prison, the average figure in England and Wales in 1973 was under 37,000.
There has also been a movement away from prison as a sentence—in 1972 out
of every 1,000 adult males found guilty of indictable offences in England and
Wales 197 were sent to prison (compared with 440 in 1953). To relieve over¬
crowding and to improve conditions generally, new prisons are being built and
existing establishments redeveloped and modernised.
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to im¬
prisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their sentence
provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in Scotland,
30 days). In addition, except in Northern Ireland, prisoners serving fixed
sentences become eligible for consideration for release on parole after serving
one-third of their sentence, subject to a minimum of one year. Each eligible
prisoner is first considered by a local review committee which reports to the
Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland on his suitability for
parole. In some cases the minister concerned has power to grant or refuse
parole, while others he refers to an officially appointed Parole Board (there is
one for England and Wales and one for Scotland). Where the Parole Board
recommends favourably, the decision whether or not to release a prisoner
depends finally on the minister, but where the Board does not recommend
release the minister has no power to grant parole. The licence remains in force
until the date on which the prisoner would have been released if he had not
been licensed or, for prisoners serving extended sentences (in England and
Wales only) and offenders sentenced while under 21 years of age, until the end
of the sentence.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence. In
England and Wales the practice is for cases to be referred to the local review
committee at a date fixed for each case after consultation between the Parcel
Employment
Education
Medical Services
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 105
Board and the Home Office. In Scotland the usual practice is to seek the views
of the local review committee after the offender has served seven years. Each
case is considered by the minister and forwarded to the appropriate Parole
Board. The Lord Chief Justice in England or the Lord Justice General in
Scotland (as the case may be) and, if he is available, the judge who presided
at the trial must be consulted before any life sentence prisoner is released. In
Northern Ireland, where the Northern Ireland Office is responsible for the
release on licence of prisoners serving life sentences, the judiciary is similarly
consulted before any such release takes place.
In England and Wales prison work is controlled by the Directorate of
Industries and Supply of the Prison Department of the Home Office. Technical
advice and services to workshops are provided by visits from regional and
headquarters staff, and industrial managers at establishments assist governors
with the day-to-day running of the workshops. In Scotland there is a Super¬
visor of Industries and Training, who advises the Director of the Prison
Service on industrial employment (including agriculture) and training. In
Northern Ireland general supervision of prison work is exercised by the
Northern Ireland Office in consultation with other departments.
The main aim of prison industries is to give an offender in custody a training
and experience that will fit him to get and retain a job on discharge. The
primary source of work lies in the requirements of the prison service itself—
building and maintenance, domestic services and equipment. Goods and ser¬
vices are also supplied to other government departments and, on an increasing
scale, to other purchasers, both inside and outside the public service. A few
prisoners are employed outside prison in agriculture and on work such as
archaeological excavation and the preservation of canals.
In England, Wales and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do; in some prisons, special incentive schemes provide an
opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and skill. In Northern
Ireland a progressive system of earnings, related to work done, is being
gradually introduced.
Any prisoner serving a sentence of four years or more may be considered
for employment in an ordinary civilian job outside prison for about six
months before his discharge. Prisoners selected for the scheme may live either
in prison or in a prison hostel; they are paid normal wages, from which they
support their families and meet their own expenses.
Education for those in custody in Great Britain is provided by local education
authorities in close liaison with the Department of Education and Science, and
in Scotland with the Scottish Education Department. Each establishment has
an education officer assisted by a number of part-time teachers and, increasingly
nowadays, one or more full-time teachers. Prisoners may attend evening classes
and take correspondence courses when these are available; other educational
facilities, such as physical training, concerts, plays, films, lectures and group
discussions, are arranged where facilities allow; prisoners may also use the
prison libraries, which depend largely upon the local public libraries for their
stocks. Selected prisoners undertake vocational training courses, leading to an
acknowledged qualification. Experiments with Open University studies, full¬
time education and day-release from prison work for study are being carried
out. Education in prisons in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the
Northern Ireland Office. Facilities are similar to those in Great Britain.
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers

whose duties include the care of the physical and mental health of prison
inmates, and the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.
In a few prisons there are large, fully equipped hospitals where major
surgery can be undertaken and treatment by visiting specialists given both to
inmates and to prisoners from other establishments. The one psychiatric
prison (in England and Wales) can accommodate some 350 people.
The hospital facilities of the National Health Service (see Chapter 6) are
available for the treatment of prisoners in appropriate cases and arrangements
may be made, where necessary, for prisoners to receive treatment after release.
Since the first prison psychologist was appointed in 1946 there has been a
constant development of the application of psychological principles to the
tasks of the penal system. The work of a prison psychologist varies from one
place to another, but often includes the assessment of prisoners, management
and institutional processes and staff training and selection. Several prisons
have their own psychiatric clinics.
All prisoners, from the beginning of their sentence, have a legal right to
write and receive letters and to be visited by their relations at regular intervals.
They also have such privileges as additional letters and visits, the use of
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the
canteen with money they have earned in prison. Depending on the facilities
available, they may be granted the further privileges of dining and recreation
in association and watching television in the evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or board of
visitors, who have power to order, among other penalties, forfeiture of re¬
mission and forfeiture of privileges.
Welfare in prisons is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole, and in
particular of the chaplains and assistant governors, but special responsibilities
attach to prison welfare officers, who, in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, are probation officers seconded by the probation and after-care service
(in Scotland, social workers from local authority social work departments). The
functions of these officers include helping the prisoner in his relationships
with individuals and organisations outside the prison, and making plans for
the prisoner’s after-care, working closely in this connection with colleagues in
the probation and after-care service and with other agencies in the com¬
munity whose help the prisoner or his family may need either during sentence
or after release.
For the spiritual welfare of the inmates, a chaplain of the Church of
England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland of
the Church of Ireland and of the Presbyterian Church), a Roman Catholic
priest and a minister of the Methodist Church are appointed to every prison.
Ministers of other denominations are appointed or specially called in as
needed.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors,
whose work is voluntary and in England and Wales is co-ordinated and
guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
In England and Wales pre-release courses are conducted at all prisons.
During these courses experts hold open forum with prisoners nearing their
release on the domestic, social and employment problems with which they
are likely to be faced. Certain categories of prisoners may be granted home
leave towards the end of their sentences to enable them to preserve links with
their families and friends, or to make new contacts with people, including
Probation
and After-care
JUSTICE AND THE LAW 107
potential employers, who may be able to assist them on release. Some categories
are considered for two periods of home leave, one allowing five clear days and
the other a week-end at home, and others for one period of five days at home.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
continues his ordinary life under the supervision of a probation officer, whose
duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. After-care, which includes
compulsory supervision for certain categories of offenders (including prisoners
released on licence and people who have been given suspended sentence of
more than six months) is aimed mainly at helping former prison inmates to
adjust themselves to life in a free community. In England and Wales both
services are provided by probation and after-care officers employed by pro¬
bation and after-care committees composed for the most part of magistrates.
In Scotland the responsibility for statutory and voluntary after-care is vested
in social workers from the local authority social work departments. In Northern
Ireland the Northern Ireland Office has responsibility for the probation and
after-care service.
Before making a probation order (which may be for not less than one and not
more than three years) the court must explain its effects and make sure that
the probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the requirements of
the order he will be liable to be dealt with again for the original offence. A
probation order can be made only if the offender is 17 years of age or over and
must have his consent; it usually requires the probationer to keep in regular
touch with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an
industrious life. It may also require him to live in a specified place, or in
appropriate circumstances to submit to treatment for his mental condition.
Probation and after-care committees may, with the approval of the Home
Secretary provide and maintain day-training centres (which offenders may be
required to attend for up to 60 days for intensive supervision and social
education as a condition of a probation order), bail hostels, probation hostels
and other establishments for use in connection with the rehabilitation of
offenders. The service is also responsible for administering the scheme of
service to the community, whereby courts have the power to require offenders
to perform, in their spare time, up to 240 hours (within 12 months) of such
unpaid work as painting and decorating for families in need, the handicapped,
and the elderly; building adventure playgrounds; clearing sites at redevelop¬
ment areas; and nature conservation tasks.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation and
after-care officers are available to every criminal court. In England and Wales
their appointment is the responsibility of probation and after-care committees
—first appointments, except in the case of professionally trained officers, being
subject to confirmation by the Home Secretary. In Northern Ireland the
Northern Ireland Office appoints probation officers.
In Scotland, where there is no separate probation service, the local authority
social work departments provide the services and officers required by the
criminal courts in their areas. Offenders subject to probation orders or to
after-care supervision following release from a penal institution are super¬
vised by specially approved social workers from these departments. Recruit¬
ment is the responsibility of the local authority concerned, and appointments
are not subject to ministerial confirmation. Unqualified staff appointed to posts
in social work departments can be seconded for professional training after
one year in post.
Responsibility for the promotion, and recognition of courses for the training

of social workers, including probation officers, is vested in the Central Council
for Education and Training in Social Work.
The Children and Young Persons Act 1969 (for England and Wales) provides
for the care and treatment of juvenile offenders1 and gives local authorities
wide responsibilities for undertaking, through social workers, enquiries and
consultations with parents, schools and the police, and for the care or super¬
vision of a child or young person alleged to be an offender and in need of care
or control. No child under ten years of age can be held criminally responsible
in England and Wales; the minimum age for prosecution is ten years.
Nearly all children charged with offences or brought before the court as
being in need of care or control are dealt with in a juvenile court (see p. 82).
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years, but no child can
be prosecuted for an offence other than at the instance of the Lord Advocate.
Children under 16 years who have committed an offence or need care and
protection are generally brought before an informal children’s hearing.
The principal orders available to the juvenile courts in England and Wales
in both care and criminal proceedings are: a care order, which commits the
child to the care of the local authority; a supervision order (usually valid for
three years or less) under which a child will normally remain at home under
the supervision of the local authority or a probation officer (see p. 107); an
order requiring a parent or guardian to enter into a recognisance to take proper
care of the child or young person and to exercise proper control over him; and
a hospital or guardianship order in accordance with the Mental Health Act
1959. In criminal proceedings the courts may also impose fines, order payment
of compensation, grant a conditional or absolute discharge or make an atten¬
dance centre order. For boys aged 14 years or over, courts may make a deten¬
tion centre order, and young people of 15 years and over may be committed to
the Crown Court with a view to borstal training. The system of local authority
community homes for young people is described on p. 142.
In Scotland a children’s hearing may commit a child to supervision by a
local authority subject to conditions appropriate to the child’s needs for com¬
pulsory care (this may include a requirement to stay in a residential home).
The treatment of young adult offenders in England and Wales (aged 17 to 20
inclusive) is under review following a report by the Home Secretary’s Advisory
Council on the Penal System (see Bibliography p. 464).
Regional planning committees, which comprise representatives of local authori¬
ties, have a duty under the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to draw up
and keep under review schemes of intermediate treatment facilities in their
regions. Facilities may be provided by local authorities, voluntary organisa¬
tions or private individuals. Intermediate treatment is intended for children
who have been placed by the juvenile court under the supervision of the local
authority or of a probation officer. It may consist either of a stay of not more
than 90 days in a residential establishment, or of attendance (not exceeding 30
days in any one year) at specified times and places for the purpose of introduc¬
ing the child to activities of a recreational, educational or cultural nature or of
social value, under the charge of a responsible person. This new provision is
thus ‘intermediate’ in the sense that it makes possible new forms of treatment
for all children subject to care proceedings (offenders and non-offenders)
1 The Act also provides for children brought before a court who are neglected, exposed
to moral danger, beyond the control of parents, or playing truant from school, or are
guilty of an offence.

which bridge the gap between removal from home and supervision, unsup¬
ported by specific treatment measures, while the child remains at home.
Sixty attendance centres have been established in England and Wales for boys
between the ages of 10 and 17 found guilty of offences for which older people
could be sentenced to imprisonment. Boys ordered to attend must do so
during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may be
required to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for a total of
not less than 12 hours (with certain exceptions) and not more than 24. The
activities include physical training and instruction in handicrafts or some other
practical subject. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys to join a
youth club or other suitable organisation. There are two attendance centres for
young men aged 17 and under 21.
In Northern Ireland there is one attendance centre; it operates on the same
lines as the centres in England and Wales, but caters for boys between the
ages of 12 and 17.
For children who are too severely disturbed and disruptive to be treated
successfully in other existing child-care establishments but who do not need
treatment in hospital, three new establishments, to be known as youth treat¬
ment centres, are being provided in England and Wales under the Children
and Young Persons Act 1969. Each centre will have a director and a multi¬
disciplinary staff, and will provide for both boys and girls. The intended
general age range is from 12 to 19. Children are placed in a centre by a local
authority (as opposed to being sent there by a law court).
Detention centres provide a means of training, and are intended to deter
from further crime, young offenders for whom a long period of residential
training does not seem necessary but who cannot be taught respect for the
law by such measures as fines or probation. In England and Wales there are
six junior centres for boys of not less than 14 and under 17, and 13 senior
centres for young men aged 17 and under 21. In Scotland there is one senior
centre. Detention centre orders in England and Wales may be for not less than
three and not more than six months. Consecutive sentences may be passed on
those over 17 but the total term may not exceed nine months at any one time.
Remission of up to one-third of the sentence may be earned for good conduct.
In Scotland the fixed period for all detention centre sentences is three months
and the age ranges from 16 to 21.
The regime at detention centres provides a normal working week of 44
hours, including one hour daily devoted to physical training. Boys of compul¬
sory school age have day-time and evening classes, and further education is
provided for others in the evenings. Nearly all young offenders discharged
from detention centres are subject to statutory supervision for 12 months.
The borstal training system, which is available for offenders who have
reached the age of 15 but are not yet 21 (16 to 21 in Scotland and Northern
Ireland), consists of different borstals specialising in different types of young
offender, classified according to such criteria as age, intelligence and criminal
sophistication. There are also a few borstals for special purposes, such as
allocation. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the period of training
ranges from six months to two years and is followed, in England and Wales,
by supervision for two years and in Northern Ireland for one year from the
date of release. In Scotland, where there is no minimum period of detention,
no
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the maximum is two years and the supervision period is for one year from the
date of release. The system is essentially remedial and educational, based on
personal training by a carefully selected staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational
training in skilled trades; there is much freedom of movement and many
borstals are open establishments.
CRIMINOLOGICAL A wide range of criminological research is carried out by the Home Office
RESEARCH Research Unit (which also serves the Scottish Home and Health Department),
by university departments and by various other research organisations; much
of it is financed by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment. Studies undertaken by the Home Office Research Unit are mainly
concentrated on subjects of direct interest to the home departments. Research
and teaching in criminology are provided at the Institute of Criminology at
Cambridge University and at Edinburgh University, at both of which post¬
graduate courses are available, and at the University of Oxford and the London
School of Economics and Political Science. Courses of criminology are also
available at the universities of Durham, Reading, Manchester, Southampton,
Keele, Sheffield, Kingston upon Hull and University College, London; and
at the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Strathclyde in Scotland. These
institutions likewise conduct research.

In March 1974 the Government instituted a major review of defence expen¬
diture in implementation of its policy to maintain a modern and effective
defence system while reducing its costs as a proportion of national resources;
at the same time reducing the estimated 1974-75 defence budget (^3,667
million) by £55 million. The review, which will not be completed until later
in the year, may have considerable implications for the commitments and
programmes outlined in this chapter.
POLICY
Britain’s basic security depends on the strength of the North Atlantic Alliance’
and it is to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) that by far the
greater part of Britain’s military forces is committed. Britain makes a major
contribution to the full range of deterrent capabilities, both conventional and
nuclear, required to maintain NATO’s defensive posture. Within NATO,
Britain has played a leading part in the efforts of the European members to
assume, through closer co-operation, an increasing responsibility for Western
defence. In the Eurogroup Britain and nine other European members have
worked to improve their contribution to the Alliance and to achieve a more
effective collective result from the available resources. Through the European
Defence Improvement Programme and additional expenditure on their
national forces they have increased the effectiveness of the Alliance’s con¬
ventional capabilities and strengthened their co-operation in such areas as
training, logistics and the procurement of equipment (see p. 118).
Britain is playing a major part in the efforts to reduce tension and achieve
more lasting peace in Europe, and is working to ensure that the negotiations
with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries on security and co¬
operation in Europe and mutual and balanced force reductions will contribute
to increased stability and improved mutual relations.
Britain continues to co-operate in maintaining stability outside Europe, being
a member of the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO), the South-East Asia
Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and contributing, with Australia, New Zealand,
Malaysia and Singapore, to the Five-Power defence arrangements in Malaysia
and Singapore. Britain is also responsible for the defence and internal security
of its remaining dependencies. In addition, the armed forces give extensive
assistance to communities overseas, particularly in such activities as disaster
assistance and development work.
Britain supports the peacekeeping and other efforts of the United Nations—
supplying the largest national contingent to the UN Peace-Keeping Force in
Cyprus—and other international consultative authorities working to eliminate
the sources of tension and conflict between nations and to promote arms con¬
trol and disarmament. Britain played a leading part in the negotiations for the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Sea-Bed Treaty, and Britain’s proposal for a
convention for the prohibition of biological methods of warfare led to the
conclusion of a further international arms control agreement.

PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister and
the Cabinet, who are responsible to Parliament. Defence problems and their
relationship with foreign and economic policy are dealt with on the Cabinet’s
behalf by the Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy, under the chair¬
manship of the Prime Minister.
The formulation of defence policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of
State for Defence. In recent years the emphasis in defence organisation has
been on increased central policy control and the co-ordinated planning of
the defence effort as a whole. The Ministry of Defence (see p. 47) ensures
effective co-ordination on policy and administration concerning the Services.
The Secretary of State is assisted by a Minister of State, and by three Under¬
secretaries of State for the Navy, Army and Air Force respectively. They,
together with the Chief of the Defence Staff, the three Service Chiefs of Staff,
the Chief of Personnel and Logistics, the Chief Scientific Adviser, the Chief
Executive of the Procurement Executive and the Permanent Under-Secretary
of State for Defence, form the Defence Council, which deals with major
defence policy under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The Chiefs
of Staff Committee, comprising the Chief of the Defence Staff as chairman and
the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services, is responsible for giving professional
advice on strategy and operations, and on the military implications of defence
policy. The day-to-day management of the three Services is the responsibility
of the Admiralty, Army and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council.
DEPLOYMENT
The basis of the present NATO strategy of flexible response, which retains
the principle of forward defence, is that credible deterrence of military actions
of all kinds is necessary. While NATO must be ready to use nuclear weapons
if necessary, its conventional forces must be maintained to enable it to respond
to aggression at a variety of levels, providing an alternative to a nuclear
response against anything but a major attack, and thereby enabling it to gain
time for negotiations to end a conflict. The strategy requires a comprehensive
range of mobile and well-equipped conventional forces and tactical and
strategic nuclear weapons.
Britain makes a major contribution to the forces required by NATO’s present
strategy. The British Polaris force forms the contribution to the Western
strategic deterrent. Virtually all ships of frigate size and above are earmarked
for assignment in an emergency to NATO. The Royal Navy also contributes
to NATO’s Standing Naval Force Atlantic, Standing Naval Force Channel
and Naval On Call Force Mediterranean. The British Army of the Rhine
(BAOR), an independent brigade in Berlin and RAF Germany are deployed in
the Federal Republic of Germany. BAOR is organised as a corps of three
divisions with five armoured brigades, one mechanised brigade and two artillery
brigades. Its peace-time strength of around 56,000 would be more than doubled
on mobilisation from Britain’s reserves (see p. 117)- Royal Air Force Germany
is a tactical air force including strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support and
air-defence aircraft. In addition, most of the air and ground combat units
based in the United Kingdom have primary roles in support of NATO, to
provide an important part of NATO’s mobile reinforcement capability. These
include the ground elements of the United Kingdom Mobile Force, the
DEFENCE
113
United Kingdom Joint Airborne Task Force and the British contribution to
the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Land). RAF Strike Command
provides forces for strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support, air defence
and maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, together with transport
forces and air support for the United Kingdom Mobile Force and Allied
Command Europe Mobile Force (Air).
At home a major task of the armed forces since 1969 has been to assist the
civil authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order, and
they have operated to counter the terrorist activities of extremist organisations.
Forces are based in Malta, Cyprus, Singapore and in certain dependencies (for
example, Hong Kong). A naval presence in the Indian Ocean and the Far East
is provided by ships based both in Singapore and Hong Kong and operating
in groups in the area. Ships operate the Beira Patrol, to enforce the UN
embargo on the import of oil to Rhodesia, and are also stationed in the
Caribbean.
THE ARMED FORCES
Britain’s armed forces are organised on a tri-service basis, and consist of the
Royal Navy and Royal Marines, the Army and the Royal Air Force.
The Royal Navy has four main arms: the Naval General Service, which
mans and maintains the surface fleet; the Fleet Air Arm; the Submarine
Service; and the Royal Marines, who primarily provide an amphibious strik¬
ing-force.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Guards division and divisions of infantry, the Royal Armoured Corps, the
Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Household Cavalry, the Corps of Royal
Engineers, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, the Royal Corps of
Signals, the Royal Corps of Transport, the Army Air Corps, the Royal Army
Ordnance Corps and the Royal Army Education Corps.
The Royal Air Force is organised in commands, on a functional basis at
home and on a geographical basis overseas. These comprise Strike Command
and Training and Support Commands, Royal Air Force Germany and
Near East Air Force. The Royal Navy has a unified sea command, Commander-
in-Chief, Fleet: shore commands have been reorganised under a single
Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command, Portsmouth, with subordinate
area commands based at Plymouth, Chatham and Rosyth. At home the Army
is under a single command, United Kingdom Land Forces: overseas com¬
mands are British Army of the Rhine, Near East Land Forces, Land Forces
Hong Kong, and British Troops Malta and Gibraltar.
The assigned British forces in Malaysia and Singapore, along with the forces
of Australia and New Zealand, are under an integrated ANZUK command in
Singapore.
The three women’s services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women’s Royal Air Force
(WRAF), are integral parts of the armed forces, and servicewomen serve
alongside servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing services are provided by
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra’s Royal
Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain’s armed forces totalled 349,269 on 1st April 1974, 78,399 in the Royal
Navy and Royal Marines, 171,705 in the Army and 99,225 in the Royal Air
Force. Recruitment to the armed forces in 1973-74 totalled 25,800, well below
that for 1972-73 due largely to the raising of the school leaving age. The total
number of civilian staff employed by the Ministry of Defence on 1st April
1974 was about 315,000.
Britain’s armed forces consist entirely of personnel serving on a voluntary
basis. Engagements available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to
22 years, with a wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service.
In 1972 a new type of engagement was introduced for non-commissioned
ranks of all three Services, under which recruits are committed for only a
minimum period of productive service (about three years) and, subject to that
minimum, may leave at any time at 18 months’ notice. Discharge may also be
granted on compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of conscience,
for which there is an independent tribunal to assess cases. Commissions may
be granted for short, medium and long terms. In all three Services there are
opportunities for promotion from the ranks, and almost half of each year’s
officer intake is on such promotion. Entry to commissioned ranks is on the
basis of educational and other qualifications (O and A levels and their equiva¬
lents or degrees): all three Services have schemes for university cadetships
which enable young men to take a degree before commencing their training.
Entrants to non-commissioned ranks are given basic training, and further and
specialist training is given during the course of their careers. Young service¬
men are encouraged to study for secondary educational qualifications, all three
Services providing extensive facilities for the consolidation and development
of Service personnel’s education. Trade and technical training, though pri¬
marily designed for Service purposes, leads for about half the total number of
servicemen to nationally recognised qualifications including qualification for
membership of trade unions.
Service technical training is highly valued in industry, which is a significant
advantage on return to civilian life. To assist such resettlement the Services
provide an advisory service, familiarisation attachments to civilian organisa¬
tions and, for those without technical qualifications, opportunity and assistance
to study for suitable civilian qualifications.
Entrants to commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia
Royal Naval College Dartmouth, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the
Royal Air Force College Cranwell or similar institutions. This is followed by
specialist training, often including degree courses at university or Service
establishments.
Staff training is provided by the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, the
Army Staff College at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at
Bracknell. The National Defence College (formerly the Joint Services Staff
College) at Chesham is designed to provide mid-career officers with training for
posts involving inter-Service staff work. Specially selected and more senior
officers from the Services, the Civil Service, and from the Commonwealth, the
United States, and allied European countries attend the Royal College of
Defence Studies (formerly the Imperial Defence College) in London, which
provides the wider background necessary for senior posts in the direction of
defence.
Considerable operational training is done through joint-Service and inter¬
allied exercises. All three Services provide training facilities for the armed
forces of allied and Commonwealth countries.

Combat forces are functionally divided as the nuclear strategic force, Royal
Navy general purpose combat forces, European theatre ground forces, other
Army combat forces and Royal Air Force general purpose forces.
The British contribution to the Western strategic deterrent is provided by the
Royal Navy’s force of four Polaris nuclear submarines—Resolution, Repulse,
Renown and Revenge. Each has indefinite underwater cruising range and is
equipped with 16 Polaris missiles with a range of about 2,800 miles and carry¬
ing thermonuclear warheads.
The naval general purpose combat forces comprise amphibious and naval air
forces, submarines (excluding the Polaris force), helicopter-cruisers, des¬
troyers, frigates, and mine countermeasure forces and support and other ships.
The following section contains detail of some of the equipment of these forces.
The aircraft carrier Ark Royal operates Phantom and Buccaneer strike aircraft,
Gannet airborne early warning aircraft and Sea King anti-submarine heli¬
copters. Amphibious forces are provided by the commando ships Bulwark
and Hermes and the assault ships Fearless and Intrepid. The command-
helicopter-cruisers Blake and Tiger also carry Sea King helicopters and are
responsible for directing and controlling naval forces. There are also eight
County class guided missile destroyers equipped with Seaslug and Seacat
surface-to-air missile systems; and the first Exocet surface-to-surface guided
missile system has been fitted in Norfolk. The Type 82 guided missile destroyer
Bristol is equipped with the Seadart area air defence missile system and the
Ikara anti-submarine guided weapon system. Sheffield, first of the new class
of Type 42 Seadart destroyers, and Amazon, first of the Type 21 frigates, have
recently entered service. There are also 26 Leander class and seven Tribal
class general purpose frigates, three anti-aircraft frigates, four aircraft-direc¬
tion frigates, 20 anti-submarine frigates, and the diesel frigate Mermaid. The
frigate classes are variously armed with automatic guns, surface-to-air
missile systems, underwater detection and anti-submarine weapons. Most have
the Wasp helicopter embarked which will in due course be replaced, where
appropriate, by the Lynx. The balance of the Fleet is made up of the mine¬
sweeper and mine-hunter forces, patrol vessels, survey and trials ships. Under
construction is the Invincible, the first of a new class of cruiser, which will be
equipped to operate Sea King helicopers and will have the optional capability
of operating maritime vertical short-take-off and landing aircraft. In addition
five of the new Sheffield class Type 42 Seadart destroyers and seven of the
Amazon class Type 21 frigates are building. The first of a new class of frigate,
Type 22, to be armed with the iSeazw//" surface-to-air missile system, has been
ordered and work is in hand on a new class of mine counter-measure vessel in
glass reinforced plastics.
Besides the four Polaris submarines (see above) there are eight nuclear-
powered fleet submarines in service together with 22 conventional patrol
submarines. A further three nuclear submarines are under construction.
Tankers and store ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service provide worldwide
afloat logistic support.
The European theatre ground forces consist of the BAOR, and the forces
stationed in Britain, the main elements of which have primary roles in support
of NATO (see p. 112).

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
This category comprises land forces stationed abroad to meet treaty commit¬
ments to Commonwealth and other countries (see p. 113).
Some of the equipment of this and the previous category is described below.
Armoured regiments are equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank and the
Swingfire long-range anti-tank guided missile. Armoured reconnaissance
regiments are now equipped with the Scorpion, mounting a 76-mm gun, the
first member of the new tracked combat reconnaissance vehicle series to come
into service. The primary tracked armoured personnel carriers used by
mechanised infantry battalions is the FV 432, some of which are fitted with
81-mm mortars or Wombat 120-mm anti-tank guns. Artillery units are
equipped with the Abbot 105-mm gun, 155-mm and 175-mm self-propelled
guns, and Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE). Tactical nuclear
support is provided by the Honest John missile and the 203-mm self-propelled
howitzer. Air defence is provided by the Thunderbird mobile surface-to-air
missile system and by the L 40/70 gun which is now being replaced by the
Rapier low-level surface-to-air missile system.
The Royal Air Force general purpose forces consist of aircraft for air defence,
strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support and tactical reconnaissance,
maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, transport and in-flight refuelling
together with RAF Regiment field squadrons.
Lightning and Phantom FGi and FGR2 aircraft, Bloodhound, Tigercat and
Rapier surface-to-air missiles are employed in air defence. Reporting and con¬
trol is provided by the computerised Linesman system, and a number of
Shackletons have been converted to provide airborne early warning over the
sea. Vulcans, Buccaneers and Phantom FGR2S operate in the strike/attack role.
The primary role of some of the strike/attack and air defence aircraft is the
shore-based protection of naval forces at sea. Vulcans, Canberras and Phantom
FGR2S are employed in the reconnaissance role; Harrier V/STOL aircraft and
Phantom FGR2S for offensive support (the Harrier also having a tactical
reconnaissance capability); and Nimrods in maritime patrol and anti-submarine
warfare. With the introduction of the Jaguar in the strike/attack, reconnais¬
sance and offensive support roles, started in 1974, the Phantom FGR2S are
being gradually transferred to air defence.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. Apart
from their essential military role—to supplement the regular forces in time of
war or emergency with trained personnel able immediately to take their places
in the Services either as formed units or as individual reinforcements—they
form an important link between the Services and the civil community. Some
of their members have a reserve liability following a period of regular service
(regular reserve): others are volunteer men and women who devote their spare
time to training for the roles they would undertake in war or an emergency. On
1st April 1974 regular reserves totalled 353,992 and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces 71,038. Cadet forces, which make a significant contribution to
recruitment to the regular forces, totalled 147,575.
The regular reserve consists of various categories of former full-time officers
and ratings liable to recall in emergency, including the Royal Fleet Reserve
of men with recent experience of active service. The volunteer reserves com¬
prise the Royal Naval Reserve, with its associated women’s reserve, and the
Royal Marines Reserve. Both carry out regular part-time training, the former

to man a number of operational minesweepers and support maritime and other
headquarters, the latter to reinforce the regular corps and in particular the
Royal Marine Commandos.
The Army reserves comprise the individual reserves and the Territorial and
Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR).
The TAVR’s primary role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to
NATO and to assist in maintaining a secure United Kingdom base in support
of the forces deployed in Europe. It consists of independent units, organised
on a local basis with regular Army and permanent civilian staff, and sponsored
units of specialists recruited on a country-wide basis. They are liable for call¬
out in an emergency. There is also a number of miscellaneous units (including
university officer training corps) and pools of individuals (known as Group B)
which have a variety of functions.
The Ulster Defence Regiment is a locally recruited, part-time force designed
to support the regular forces in their security tasks.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of former regular officers and personnel
with a reserve liability, and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which
includes the 16 university air squadrons. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force
consists of maritime headquarter units which would support regular forma¬
tions in an emergency.
Civil defence arrangements are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, by local
authorities, police authorities and government departments. Supplementary
effort from individual volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought
in either at the discretion of local authorities or in response to a national appeal
in time of crisis. A central point of recent policy has been to improve the pre¬
paredness of local government to meet a war emergency; there is much
common ground between such planning and the preparations and organisation
for a major peace-time emergency or national disaster. Activities have therefore
also been directed towards creating a closer relationship in local planning for
the different emergencies of peace and war.
Within an annual budget of £12 million emphasis is placed on a high level
of central and local government planning. Studies and seminars are arranged
by the Home Office on staff college lines.
Arrangements also include an emergency system for decentralised govern¬
mental control and communications. The United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation, including the civilian Royal Observer Corps, is
organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and power of
nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive fall-out.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and pro¬
duction) of defence equipment, including aircraft, ships, ordnance, guided
weapons and electronics, lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive was set up in August 1971 following a
reorganisation of the departments responsible for defence procurement and
civil aerospace. The main objectives of the reorganisation have been to establish
a closer liaison between the Service users and the machinery for procurement,
Il8 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
closer co-ordination with industry in the formulation of programmes, and
stronger and more accountable management, so ensuring a co-ordinated and
cost-effective approach.
Research The major part of research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence’s research
and Development and development establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a sub¬
stantial amount of research by industry and the universities. The research and
development establishments have a very wide technological capability, which
has civil as well as military applications: for example, support is given to civil
aerospace projects such as Concorde and advanced aero-engines. On the
development side, the establishments collaborate closely with the Ministry’s
contractors by monitoring their progress, assisting in testing programmes, and
in solving particular technical problems.
Modern defence equipment is becoming ever more complex, and its
development requires a high initial investment. The search for a more efficient
use of these resources has caused attention to be concentrated on collaborative
projects, which enable the cost of development and production to be shared.
On occasions, the outright purchase of foreign equipment is the most econo¬
mical solution. Nevertheless, the importance of maintaining a sound national
industrial base for defence procurement is recognised, and there is close con¬
sultation between government and industry both in the National Defence
Industries Council and through other specialised machinery.
Collaboration between Britain and European countries is already extensive,
and may be expected to increase, particularly through the work of the Euro¬
group (see p. m). The most important single project, the multi-role combat
aircraft, is being developed by Britain, Italy and the Federal Republic of
Germany. A number of Anglo-French projects—the Jaguar aircraft, the
Martel air-to-surface missile, the Puma and Gazelle helicopters—are reaching
completion, and the Lynx helicopter is well advanced. Britain, the Federal
Republic of Germany and Italy are collaborating in the development of 155-
mm towed and self-propelled howitzers and an artillery rocket system, while
Britain and the Federal Republic are studying the possible collaborative
development of a future main battle tank. Britain and Belgium are partners in
the programme for the development and production of a family of air-portable,
armoured combat reconnaissance vehicles.
Britain has co-operated with Canada in the development of a surveillance
drone, with Australia on the Ikara anti-submarine equipment, and is working
with both these countries on a sonobuoy system.
National Projects A considerable number of projects, covering all the main equipment areas, are
under development. They include the HS1182 jet trainer, the Blowpipe man-
portable air defence missile, an underwater-launched anti-ship guided missile,
navigation and attack systems for aircraft, radar, sonar and communication
systems, the Type 22 frigate, and a new range of logistic vehicles for battlefield
support.
Production Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards.
Production may also be undertaken on a collaborative basis. The Defence Sales
organisation provides support, assistance and advice to British industry and the
Royal Ordnance Factories in promoting the sales of defence equipment over¬
seas. In 1974-75 the value of exports of British defence equipment is expected
to be in excess of £400 million.
6 Social Welfare
Voluntary
Organisations
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain central and local government are responsible for a wide range of
health and social services. Central government is responsible directly for social
security, including family allowances, national insurance and financial help to
those in special need. It is also responsible for all health services and the
health authorities and boards which administer these services are its agents.
It has a certain overall indirect responsibility for many local authority services.
Local authorities are directly responsible for education (see Chapter 7) and
housing (see Chapter 9) and for a variety of personal social services (all des¬
cribed in this chapter). They also have certain responsibilities regarding en¬
vironmental health. Public authorities in Britain spent in 1973-74 16,088
million on this range of services, that is, about £287 a year per head of the
population.
The publicly provided services are supplemented by those provided by
voluntary organisations and by individual voluntary workers. Voluntary
organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all the
social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and
social and recreational clubs before these were provided by the state. They
made themselves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very
old, the homeless and the handicapped. Gradually the state accepted the
primary responsibility for the major services, supplementing the voluntary
services and developing a comprehensive structure that ensured a minimum
standard of living and well-being for all citizens.
State and voluntary social services are now complementary and co-operative.
Both central and local authorities make grants to the voluntary social services.
Public authorities plan and carry out their duties taking account of the volun¬
tary help available and co-operating with the voluntary agencies, which have
specialised in meeting particular needs, while the residential provision made by
public authorities for the care of children, the chronic sick, the mentally ill or
handicapped, the disabled and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes
of various types.
In England and Wales the Charity Commission, a government department,
gives free advice to trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their pur¬
poses or facilitate their administration when necessary, it maintains central
and local registers of charities which are open to public inspection; and it
investigates and checks abuses, though it has no power to act in the adminis¬
tration of a charity.
Co-ordination of government interests in voluntary social service is the
responsibility of the Home Office in England and Wales and of the Scottish
Office in Scotland. The Volunteer Centre, a national centre for information
and research on voluntary work, was established in London in 1973 with the
aid of a government grant. Its initial focus is on the health and social services.
The number of voluntary organisations in Britain runs into thousands; they
range from national organisations to small individual local groups. Most
organisations, however, are members of larger associations or are represented
120
Urban
Programme
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly
concerned with giving personal service, others in the formation of public
opinion and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems include the
voluntary family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Association,
Family Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisa¬
tions; the National Council for One-Parent Families; and the Samaritans,
who help people near to committing suicide.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people, particularly
those belonging to a number of national and local organisations, for example,
the Young Volunteer Force Foundation, Community Service Volunteers,
Task Force, Scouts, Girl Guides and school groups.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by—among
others—the British Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Association
and Brigade, the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service and the Leagues of
Hospital Friends, but a number of societies exist to help people with particular
disabilities and difficulties. Such societies, some of which are constituent
members of the Central Council for the Disabled, include the Royal National
Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, MIND
(National Association for Mental Health), the National Society for Mentally
Handicapped Children, the Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous, Age
Concern and their Scottish equivalents.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Com¬
mittee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England
Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work, the
Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Associa¬
tion, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the Society of St. Vincent
de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish Welfare
Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which gives help in every kind of practical difficulty, brings
‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, provides flatlets
and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family problems and assists in
hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work in emergencies.
The main voluntary body in England and Wales providing central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned with social
service is the National Council of Social Service, which brings together most
of the principal voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a
whole or in groups of those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth
work or work among the handicapped. There are also the Scottish Council of
Social Service and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, which
perform similar functions. The Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of which there are
now some 625 in Britain, are steadily increasing in number. The primary role
of the bureaux is to give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt
about his rights or who does not know about the state or voluntary services
which could help him.
A four-year urban programme providing for government-aided local authority
expenditure of some £20 million-^25 million was launched at the end of 1968
to assist areas of special social need, in particular to relieve problems resulting
SOCIAL WELFARE
121
from overcrowding, inadequate housing and schools, and other forms of
deprivation. In 1970 the programme was extended to 1976 with total expendi¬
ture for the period 1968-76 of £60 million-^65 million at 1970 prices. Projects
being undertaken include help for playgroups and the provision and improve¬
ment of nursery schools and classes, day nurseries and playgrounds, language
classes for immigrants, in-service training courses for teachers, children’s
homes, family advice centres, housing aid services, information and advice
centres, help for community centres and summer holiday schemes for deprived
children. A particular aim of the programme is to support the work of volun¬
tary bodies in areas of special social need by encouraging local authorities to
grant-aid the activities of such organisations.
An experiment in community development is also being undertaken by the
Government. This involves bringing together those services, both statutory
and voluntary, which are concerned with relieving various forms of social
handicap and encouraging the resources of self-help within the community.
Local projects involving action and research teams are in progress in 12 areas,
mainly situated in the inner districts of large conurbations.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, family allowances, family
income supplements and supplementary benefits together with (in a special
category) war pensions constitute a comprehensive system of social security in
the United Kingdom.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services
in Great Britain; within the Department the Supplementary Benefits Com¬
mission is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern
Ireland the first five of these schemes are administered by the Department of
Health and Social Services which contains the Supplementary Benefits Com¬
mission for Northern Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners
and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims
for the various benefits are decided by independent authorities.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may
be regarded as especially important in England and Wales), the modern system
of comprehensive provision is a creation of the twentieth century. Non¬
contributory old age pensions were introduced in 1908, and the first contribu¬
tory pensions for old people, widows and orphans in 1926. A contributory
National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and in the same year
a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920 was
extended to cover the great majority of employees. By the beginning of the
second world war social security provision in Britain was among the best in
the world, but lacked co-ordination because of its piecemeal development, and
not everyone came within its scope. In the immediate post-war years a series
of Acts introduced the present comprehensive system, which became fully
operative in July 1948. Statutory provision for the war disabled goes back to
the end of the sixteenth century, but the main lines of the present war pension
provisions were laid down during the first world war with further develop¬
ments during and after the second world war.
Family allowances and national insurance and industrial injuries benefits
or allowances, other than maternity, unemployment, sickness, invalidity,
injury or disablement benefit, are included in the taxable income on which

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support of
dependants. Family income supplements, attendance allowance and war dis¬
ablement pensions are not taxable.
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a
single system. The European Community Regulations on social security,
framed to protect the benefit rights of people moving within the Community,
apply to employed workers (and to pensioners who were employed workers)
who are nationals of any of the Community countries or of Gibraltar. People
covered by these Regulations are entitled to benefit under the social security
arrangements of any Community country, including Gibraltar, where they
are working or visiting, on the same basis as nationals of that country. There
are also bilateral reciprocal arrangements which apply, between the United
Kingdom and other member states of the European Community individually,
to self-employed and non-employed people who are outside the scope of the
European Community Regulations. Reciprocal agreements on industrial
injuries, family allowances and most national insurance benefits are in opera¬
tion with Austria, Finland, Jersey and Guernsey, Norway, Sweden, Switzer¬
land and Yugoslavia. Agreements with Cyprus, Israel, Malta, and Turkey
cover industrial injuries and most national insurance benefits. With Australia
and New Zealand there are agreements on family allowances and most national
insurance benefits. There are limited agreements with Bermuda, Canada,
Jamaica and the United States. The Isle of Man is also party to most of these
agreements with other countries.
Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allowances
Act 1965 (which consolidated the Acts of 1945-64), and in Northern Ireland
under its own legislation. They are being paid in Great Britain to about 4-4
million families with over 11*3 million children, and in Northern Ireland to
some 141,000 families. The allowances are payable to families with two or
more children who are under minimum school-leaving age or under 19 and
either in full-time education or apprentices with low earnings.
The rates of the allowances are ^0-90 a week for families with two children
below the age limits and a further £1 a week for each additional child.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit
the family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid either to
the mother or to the father. There is no insurance qualification for title to the
allowances, but there are certain residence conditions.
Family Income Supplement provides a cash benefit for families (including
single parents) with small incomes where the wage-earner is in full-time work
and there is at least one dependent child. It is payable when the weekly sum of
a family’s resources falls below a prescribed amount, fixed at £25 a week
where there is one child plus £2 f°r each additional child. The weekly rate of
the supplement is half the difference between the family’s income and the
prescribed amount up to a maximum of £$‘50 for one- or two-child families
or £y if the family has three or more children.
The National Insurance Acts apply, in general, to everyone over minimum
school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. (The National Insurance Act 1965
consolidated the provisions of the National Insurance Acts 1946-64.)
SOCIAL WELFARE

Contributors
The national insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
where contribution conditions have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for
partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by contributions of employers
in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution made by the
Exchequer out of general taxation.
The original system was based on contributions varying only with the sex,
age (under or over 18 years), and insurance class (see below), while benefits
were at standard rates for people over 18. Additional earnings-related contribu¬
tions and benefits were subsequently introduced in two stages (1961 and 1966).
In November 1970 pensions were introduced for elderly people who had
been over pension age when the scheme started, and in April 1971 for widows
aged between 40 and 50 when widowed or when entitlement to widowed
mother’s allowance ended. From September 1971 an old person’s pension
became payable to all other non-pensioners aged 80 and over; at the same time
an invalidity pension was introduced for those who had received sickness
benefit for six months, with an additional invalidity allowance for people
becoming chronically sick more than five years before retirement age. An
attendance allowance for severely disabled people needing attendance or
supervision both night and day became payable in December 1971. This was
extended during 1973 with the introduction of an allowance at a lower rate for
those needing attention or supervision either by night or by day.
Contributors under the national insurance scheme are divided into three
classes:
Class 1. Employed people. Most of those who work for an employer under a
contract of service or are paid apprentices—over 23 million.
Class 2. Self-employed people. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—about 1^ million.
Class 3. Non-employed people. All those insured who are not in class 1 or
class 2—about a quarter of a million.
There is a general liability to pay flat-rate contributions according to this
classification but certain people are excepted. These include full-time students,
prisoners and most people in receipt of national insurance benefits. Self-
employed and non-employed persons whose income is below ^650 a year can
apply for exemption. Married women can choose to pay contributions and
receive benefit in their own right or not to pay flat-rate contributions (if they
are working they must pay graduated contributions) and rely upon their
husband’s insurance for maternity grant, retirement pension (at a lower rate),
widow’s benefit and death grant. If a married woman works for an employer
he must pay his full share of the flat-rate contributions even if she has chosen
not to pay flat-rate contributions.
Flat-rate contributions are credited to students up to the age of 18, and
to most people in receipt of national insurance benefits. People who are
excepted from liability to pay but are not entitled to credits may pay con¬
tributions at the non-employed rate if they wish to safeguard entitlement to
retirement pension and widow’s benefit.
An employed person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions
at the age of 70 (for a man, 65 for a woman), or when he retires from regular
employment after reaching minimum pension age (65 for men, 60 for women),
whichever is the earlier. If he does any work as an employed person thereafter,
he must pay an industrial injuries contribution; the employer still has to pay
his full share of the flat-rate contribution.
124
Contributions
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Flat-rate contributions are normally paid by means of national insurance
stamps bought from a post office and fixed, for each contributor, to a single
contribution card. All three classes pay flat-rate contributions (see Table 7)
and these include the national health service contribution (which for con¬
venience is paid with the national insurance contribution although the two
services are separate). The stamps for class 1 contributors also include the
employer’s redundancy contribution (to help to provide for payments in
certain circumstances to employees whose work is terminated, see p. 341). It
is the employer’s responsibility in the first place to see that the class 1 contribu¬
tions are paid, but he can deduct the employees’ share from their wages. The
self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards. Flat-rate
contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or
injury, or if certain widow’s benefits are being paid.

(page references are to the text of the Handbook)
A general election was held in Britain on 10th October 1974. The number of
seats obtained by each party (see p. 32) and the distribution of votes (see p. 32)
were as follows:
Party Seats

MINISTERIAL CHANGES
The number of Cabinet ministers (see p. 42) is 23 and the number of junior
ministers in some departments (see pp. 45-58) has been altered.
The Lord President of the Council, a senior Cabinet minister, has been made
responsible for policy concerning the devolution of government functions (see
footnote, p. 23); a new unit has been set up within the Cabinet Office (see p. 45)
to deal with this and other work related to the development of British political
institutions.
THE NOVEMBER BUDGET
The aim of the Budget (see p. 360) presented to Parliament on 12th November
1974 was described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as helping to lay the
foundation of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with Britain's economic
problems over the following four years. This strategy included giving priority
to investment and the balance of payments over public expenditure and
private consumption; a national campaign against waste and a programme of
energy conservation; and prevention of excessive growth of the money supply.
In order to establish firm control over the public sector demand on
resources, the growth of public expenditure (see p. 355) would be held back
to an average of 2.75 per cent a year over the next four years.
The public sector borrowing requirement for 1974-75 (see p. 359) had
been revised upwards to £5,500 million due primarily to a loan of £100 million to
building societies (see p. 372), wage and other cost increases of about £1,000
million and an increase in subsidies (see p. 193) of some £1,100 million. The
Budget measures would involve a further increase to £6,300 million. The main
proposals are as follows:
Personal Taxation
The starting point of the investment income surcharge (see p, 360) would be
reduced from £2,000 to £1,000, except for those aged over 65 for whom the

starting point would be £1,500. Tax benefits for elderly and blind people
would be improved from April 1975.
Company Sector
Companies with a closing stock of at least £25,000 would be granted a post¬
ponement of corporation tax (see pp. 361—2) on the abnormal increase,
caused by inflation, in the value of stocks and work in progress. The initial
building allowance (see p. 205) would be increased from 40 to 50 per cent.
Additional help for the financial position of industries would be provided
through amendments to the Price Code (see p. 193) and through a
programme of medium-term lending by Finance for Industry Ltd. (see
p. 369), whose resources would be expanded by the Bank of England and
the London and Scottish clearing banks.
Taxes on Capital
A Capital Transfer Tax (see p. 362) would apply to all lifetime gifts made on
or after 26 March 1974 and would replace estate duty (see p. 362). The rates
would apply for the estate duty chargeable in respect of deaths after 12th
November 1974. Transfers not exceeding £15,000 would not be charged to
tax and the rates would be progressive, rising to 75 per cent on transfers
over £2 million.
Value-added Tax
The rate of value-added tax (see p. 363) on petrol (hydrocarbon oil for private
use) was increased from 8 per cent to 25 per cent.
Sterling Guarantee Arrangements
There would be no extension beyond the end of 1974 of the guarantee of
official overseas holdings of sterling (see p. 195).
Social Security
Retirement pensions (see p. 125) would be increased from April 1975 by
£1.60 for a single person and £2.50 for a married couple. Family allowances
(see p. 122) would be increased at the same time by £0.60 for second
children and £0.50 for third and subsequent children. There would also be
increases and improvements in other social security benefits.
Oil Taxation
An Oil Taxation Bill would be presented to Parliament to impose a new tax on
the profits of the oil companies engaged in operations on the Continental Shelf
(see pp. 257 and 261).
Development Land Tax
As a transitional measure designed to help to bring land needed for development
into community ownership (on which proposals have been published), legislation
would provide for a new Development Land Tax (see p. 166). The tax would be
levied at a flat rate of 80 per cent and would be payable when development
value was realised.
INDUSTRY (seepp. 193and201)
The Government's proposals for industrial reform and reconstruction include
the setting up of a National Enterprise Board, through which the Government
would invest in British manufacturing industry. A system of Planning
Agreements is also proposed, involving regular discussion with the Government
of the forward plans of key industrial companies, drawn up by management
in consultation with workers' representatives.
Please Note: The figures for employment in agriculture given on p. 278, paragraph 1, line 3,
in this edition include Northern Ireland; previously the figures have excluded Northern
Ireland.
12th November 1974
SOCIAL WELFARE
125
Benefits
Amounts
In general graduated contributions are payable by employed people (in¬
cluding married women) aged between 18 and 70 (65 for women) who earn
more than £9 a week. Employees whose job provides them with an occupa¬
tional pension of at least 363-48 a year for each year of service (362-90 for
women) may be ‘contracted out’ of part of the graduated pension scheme.
Accordingly while all employees pay 5-5 per cent of their weekly earnings
between 3618 and ^62, contracted out employees pay only 1-25 per cent on
their weekly earnings between 369 and 3618, while those not contracted out pay
the full 5*5 per cent on this lower range as well. Their employers pay the same
amount.
Graduated contributions provide a graduated addition to retirement pension
and meet the cost of earnings-related supplements to sickness and unemploy¬
ment benefit and to widow’s allowance. From April 1975, for people working
for an employer, flat rate national insurance contributions and graduated
contributions will be replaced by a system of earnings related contributions.
The scheme provides payments to contributors in the event of unemployment
(if normally working for an employer), sickness (if normally working for an
employer or self-employed), and confinement and the weeks immediately
before and after (for women normally working for an employer or self-
employed and paying national insurance contributions at the full rate). Retire¬
ment pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for women) if they
have retired from regular work and from the age of 70 (65 for women) even if
they continue to work; people aged 80 and over who have not participated in
the scheme are eligible for an old person’s pension; widows normally receive
benefit in the first 26 weeks after bereavement and subsequently while they
have young children or if they have reached the age of 40 when widowed or
before their children have grown up; and there are two kinds of allowance in
respect of orphan children where a widow’s pension is not payable. The scheme
also provides lump-sum cash grants for two expensive contingencies—the
birth of a child and a death.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must actually
have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have been paid or
credited over a specified period. There are special rules to help a widow who
does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood or when her
children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment benefit in
the period before she can have established or re-established herself in insur¬
ance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help a
woman who has been divorced and was not paying contributions during her
marriage.
The standard flat-rate benefit for single men and women is 368-60 a week for
unemployment or sickness, while for invalidity, widows’ and retirement
pensions it is ^10. Benefit, other than invalidity pension for those under
retirement pension age, may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been
paid, but is not affected by other unearned income or the previous level of
earnings. Earnings received while the benefit is in payment, however, may
cause its reduction or withdrawal: unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a
person earning more than a specified amount from a subsidiary occupation;
retirement pensioners under the age of 70 (65 for women) have their pensions
reduced in step with earnings over certain specified amounts; sickness and
126
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
invalidity benefits, though not affected by continued payment of wages during
illness, are not normally payable to a person doing any actual work. Widows’
benefits, however, are not affected by earnings. Exceptions to the basic flat
rates are the higher rate of ^14 a week payable to widows during the first 26
weeks after bereavement, the increased retirement pension earned by some¬
one who has continued at work and paid contributions beyond minimum
pension age and the invalidity allowance paid to people becoming chronically
sick more than five years before pension age; and the lower rate of ^6-05 a
week unemployment or sickness benefit payable to married women who pay
contributions and the rates for widows between 40 and 50 which reduce on a
scale to £3 a week for a woman aged 40 at the date of entitlement. An age
addition of £0-25 a week is paid to pensioners aged 80 and over, and people
over 80 who have failed to qualify for a national insurance pension receive an
old person’s pension to bring their total pension up to £6 a week (^9*70 for a
married couple). Invalidity allowance is ^2-05, ^1-30 or ^0-65, depending
upon the age at which incapacity begins. An attendance allowance of £8 a week
is paid to severely disabled people requiring a great deal of help from another
person both by day and by night. A lower rate of £5*35 may be paid to those
who need help either by day or by night.
Additions to benefits are payable for dependants. For invalidity and retire¬
ment pensions the additions are £6 for a wife or other adult dependant and
for these pensioners and for widow’s benefit ^4‘90 for each child inclusive of
family allowances. For other beneficiaries the additions are less—^5-30 for an
adult and £2-70 for each child, inclusive of family allowances.
A guardian’s allowance of ^4-90 a week is payable to a person who has in
his or her family a child who has lost both parents, one of whom was insured
under the National Insurance Acts. The allowance can sometimes be paid
on the death of one parent. For certain fatherless children there is a child’s
special allowance also of £4-90 a week inclusive of family allowances; this is
payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled and who
has not remarried, if her former husband dies and she has a child to whose
support he was contributing before he died.
The graduated addition to retirement pension is at the rate of £o-02\ a
week for each £7‘$o of all graduated contributions paid by a man and for each
£() of such graduated contributions paid by a woman (with, in each case, the
matching amount of graduated contribution coming from the employer). The
earnings-related supplements to flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefits
are one-third of that part of a person’s average weekly earnings between £10
and £30 and 15 per cent of that part between ^30 and £42 but the supple¬
ments cannot raise the total benefit, including increases for dependants,
beyond 85 per cent of the average weekly earnings on which the supplement
is based. The supplement is also paid on this basis to widow beneficiaries who
have the appropriate record of earnings, if they become unemployed or sick.
A supplement based on the late husband’s earnings is also paid, as an addition
to the widow’s allowance, to widows whose husbands were under 70 and had
not retired from regular employment.
A £25 maternity grant is payable for a confinement and a further £25 for
each additional child born at the same confinement living 12 hours after birth;
while a £30 death grant is payable on the death of an adult insured person or
certain close relatives of the insured person (less for a child, or for an adult
who was within ten years of minimum pension age when the scheme started).
Duration
In general, national insurance payments are paid as long as the situation

requiring them lasts. However, invalidity pension cannot be paid and sickness
benefit can only be paid for one year if fewer than 156 employed or self-
employed contributions have been made (possible in three years for a contri¬
butor continuously at work), while unemployment benefit is payable for a
maximum of one year. The supplement to unemployment and sickness benefit
is paid for a maximum of six months starting from the thirteenth day of
unemployment or incapacity for work. Maternity allowance (j£8-6o a week)
normally begins 11 weeks before the expected week of confinement and ends
six weeks after the expected week or the actual confinement if this is later.
Similarly, a widowed mother’s allowance at the full rate ceases when her
children are no longer dependent on her, though a widow can continue to
receive £10 a week for herself while she has living with her a son or daughter
under 19. The widow’s pension payable to the childless widow, provided she
is 40 or over at the time of being widowed, or the similar pension payable to
the widowed mother who has reached 40 before her widowed mother’s allow¬
ance ends, normally continues until she has reached minimum pension age
(provided she does not remarry before that age) and retired, or at most till the
age of 65. On retirement she receives a pension at a rate not lower than her
widow’s pension.
The industrial injuries insurance scheme, which, in 1948, replaced the work¬
men’s compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s Compensa¬
tion Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused by accidents
arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed diseases
due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone in class 1 of
the national insurance scheme and certain others. Like the national insurance
scheme, the industrial injuries scheme is financed partly from contributions
(see Table 7) and partly from taxation. The legal basis of the scheme is the
National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 which consolidated the 1946
Act and subsequent legislation. Similar cover against industrial injuries and
diseases is provided by Northern Ireland’s legislation.
Injury benefit for an adult is ,£11-35 a week plus £5 *30 for an adult dependant,
^2-70 for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits, £i-8o
for the second child and £1*70 for each other child in addition to any family
allowance payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as
a result of an industrial accident or prescribed disease, and payment can
continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident or
development of the disease. A person entitled to sickness benefit who draws
injury benefit instead, also receives any earnings-related supplement (see p.
126) to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss
of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from .£16-40 for 100 per
cent disablement to £3-28 a week for 20 per cent disablement, but for disable¬
ment of less than 20 per cent a gratuity of up to j£ 1,090 is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows; unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of £10; constant
attendance allowance of up to j£6-6o weekly normally, or a special rate of
£9-90 or ,£13-20 a week in exceptionally severe cases; an allowance of ,£6-6o
a week for exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance of
128
Death Benefits

SUPPLEMENTARY
BENEFITS
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
up to £6'$6 for a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or to do work
of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance which raises the
benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment for the
industrial disability. Increases of benefit for dependants are payable with un¬
employability supplement and hospital treatment allowance. People receiving
unemployability supplement may also receive an additional allowance similar
to invalidity allowance (see pp. 124 and 126).
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of £14 a week is payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood. In addition she receives any earnings-related supplement (see p.
126) that would have been paid had she claimed widow’s allowance under the
main national insurance scheme. Thereafter, the widow can receive a pension
of j£io-55 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband’s death, or has
dependent children or other special needs; otherwise she receives £2 a week.
If she had been living apart from her husband, a pension is payable only if she
was receiving or entitled to receive at least £0-2$ a week for her maintenance
from him.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits at the higher rate of £4-90 to widows but at the lower rate of £2-70
for other beneficiaries.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions, allowances or gratuities.
The Ministry of Social Security Act 1966, now known as the Supplementary
Benefit Act 1966, provided for a scheme of supplementary benefits to replace
the system which had been administered by the former National Assistance
Board since 1948. The Act established within the then Ministry of Social
Security a Supplementary Benefits Commission responsible for guiding the
scheme and for determining awards of benefit. Parallel legislation in Northern
Ireland made similar provision.
Every person in Great Britain aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work,
attending school or involved in a trade dispute and whose resources are
insufficient to meet his requirements is entitled to a supplementary benefit.
The benefit takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people under the
statutory retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those over. The
benefit is the amount by which a person’s requirements exceed his available
resources, both being defined by rules laid down by the Act. The calculation
of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and family
groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each case,
an addition for rent. For the old and most other long-term cases a higher long¬
term scale rate is payable. Available resources include certain income and
capital; the main national insurance and industrial injury benefits, family
allowances, family income supplement and maintenance payments from a
husband or the father of the claimant’s children are taken into account in full
but some part of all other resources is disregarded.
The payment of a supplementary allowance in the case of an able-bodied
person of working age may be conditional on registering at a local office of the
Employment Service Agency.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. The commission
provides temporary accommodation for them in 21 reception centres, three of
SOCIAL WELFARE
129
which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the commission. For
men who have been unemployed for long periods and who are receiving
supplementary allowances or are using reception centres, it runs 15 re¬
establishment centres, three of which have residential accommodation where
they are given help to fit them again for work.
WAR PENSIONS
AND RELATED
SERVICES
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through war or
service in the Forces since the second world war are paid under Royal Warrants
and other instruments administered by the Department of Health and Social
Security.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier
is ^16-40 a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of
disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the condition of the person
disabled by service with that of a normal healthy person of the same age and
sex. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (£10-75 a week), constant attendance (up to £6-6o
and, exceptionally, £13-20 a week), comforts (£i,40 or £2-80 a week), and
lowered standard of occupation (up to £6-56 a week). An additional allowance
of £3-30 or £6-6o according to the severity of the disablement is payable to
war pensioners who are receiving constant attendance allowance at a rate
above the normal maximum. An age allowance (between £1*20 and £3*60 a
week) is payable to disablement pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose
assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
free of income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any family
allowances payable.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is £13 a week, with additional allow¬
ances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to £5 a
week). There is an additional allowance of £1*30 for widows aged 65 which is
increased to £2-60 at the age of 70. Parents or other relatives who were
dependent on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces may
receive pensions if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners and war orphans which is available to help any who require
advice or assistance. War pensioners have priority for treatment of their war
disablements in National Health Service hospitals subject only to needs of
emergency and other urgent cases.
Many voluntary associations and ex-Service organisations give financial aid
and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The department’s welfare officers work in close co-operation with these and
other statutory bodies.
HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
The concern of the state with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second half
of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
for the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
130

from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 1948 of a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every resident and to
every visitor taken ill or meeting with an accident while in Britain. Reciprocal
health agreements have been concluded between Britain and certain countries
and in any member country of the European Community the families of British
nationals and stateless persons permanently resident in Britain and working
for a British employer or receiving British social security benefit are entitled to
urgent medical treatment on the same basis as the nationals of that country.
Scientific discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the
development of new drugs, and the improved services of the last 70 years,
particularly in maternity and child health, school health services and school
meals, are reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 10) and improved
physique. The infant mortality rate has more than halved since the National
Health Service was inaugurated; this and the maternal death rate are among
the lowest in the world. The health of children has steadily improved and
emphasis is now placed on prevention or early detection of disease or dis¬
ability. Deaths from such diseases as tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and diph¬
theria have fallen so markedly that they are no longer major health problems.
Diseases now in the forefront of research programmes include cancer and
diseases of the central nervous system, such as muscular dystrophy. Efforts
are also being made to combat some of the most prevalent diseases, which
include, besides the common cold and influenza, bronchitis, rheumatism and
arthritis, and heart diseases.
The Public Health Acts of 1936 and 1961 and the Health Services and Public
Health Act 1968 constitute the present basic public health code in England and
Wales. Local authorities (under the general direction of the Department of
Health and Social Security or the Welsh Office and the Department of the
Environment) have extensive powers for making and administering by-laws on
matters of public health.
The general form of the organisation established in 1948 to administer the
National Health Service persisted until the end of March 1974. Essentially it
was a tripartite structure, corresponding to the three main parts of the service:
the hospital service, the general practitioner service and the local authority
health service, comprising a range of home and clinic services for the preven¬
tion of ill-health and for treatment or care. The School Health Service was
separately administered by the education authorities and environmental health
was largely the responsibility of the local authorities. A new and functionally
unified health service administration came into operation from April 1974 at
the same time as the new structure of local government in England and Wales
(see p. 65). The main aims of the reorganisation have been to unify the
various forms of health provision, to improve co-ordination between the health
service and local authorities, and to streamline the management of the health
service. Under the Acts establishing the new system, the health ministers—
the Secretary of State for Social Services in England, and the Secretaries of
State for Scotland and Wales—have a broad responsibility for all aspects of the
health services in their respective countries, and a duty to make provision to
meet all reasonable requirements for hospitals and other accommodation for
health services; for medical, dental, nursing and ambulance services; for
facilities for expectant and nursing mothers and young children; for facilities
for the care and after-care of the sick; for the provision of a contraceptive
service; and for any other services needed for prevention, treatment and
diagnosis of illness.
SOCIAL WELFARE
131
The organisation established to run these health services is three-tier in
England, and two-tier in Scotland and Wales. Within each of the three coun¬
tries the health departments (the Department of Health and Social Security in
England, the Scottish Home and Health Department in Scotland, and the
Welsh Office in Wales) are responsible for strategic planning, while area
authorities, called area health authorities in England and Wales and health
boards in Scotland, are responsible for area planning and operational control
of all health services in their area. In England only, because of its greater size
and population, an intermediate tier of regional authorities responsible for
regional planning and certain central services has been interposed between the
area authorities and the central department.
There are 14 regional health authorities and 90 area health authorities in
England, 12 area health authorities in Wales and 15 health boards in Scotland.
They are all statutory agencies of central government, but co-operate closely
with local authorities responsible for social work and environmental and other
services. In general the areas covered by area health authorities and health
boards correspond with those of the new major local authorities established in
England and Wales and to be established in Scotland in May 1975.
Area authorities and health boards have wide discretion to determine the
pattern of services best suited to their area, and most have deputed the day-to-
day running of services to health districts which usually contain a district
general hospital and have a population of between 150,000 and 300,000,
though some are considerably larger.
The health authorities and boards consist mainly of unpaid part-time
members. The chairmen and members of the regional authorities and health
boards, and the chairmen of the area health authorities are appointed by the
health minister concerned after consultation with professional, local authority,
university and other interests. The members of the area health authorities are
appointed by the regional health authorities in England, and the health minis¬
ters in Wales except for some members appointed by the corresponding local
authorities, two elected by community health councils (see below), and at least
one nominated by the university concerned. Area authorities in areas con¬
taining a teaching hospital are known as area authorities (teaching) and in addi¬
tion to two university nominees contain at least two members with experience
of medical teaching. All regional and area health authorities contain two
members drawn from staff employed in the NHS, other than doctors and
nurses.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the health ministers
but it is their responsibility to provide hospital clinical facilities for the training
of medical students. The universities are responsible for the provision of
teaching.
There is statutory provision for professional advisory committees at all
levels of the new service, and the authorities have a duty to consult with these
committees. At the national level the main standing advisory bodies are the
Central Health Services Council in England and Wales, and the Scottish
Health Service Planning Council in Scotland. There is also in Scotland a
Common Services Agency serving all 15 Scottish boards.
Public representation in the reorganised service for England and Wales is
provided by district community health councils. These consist of 20-30
members, half of them appointed by local government councils and the rest
mainly on the nomination of voluntary bodies.
In Scotland local health councils have been set up by the health boards to
represent the interests of the public, and to report on questions relating to the

health service in their area or district. The appointment of Health Service
Commissioners is an additional safeguard and means of redress.
The three Health Service Commissioners (for England, for Scotland and for
Wales) are statutory independent officers whose function is to investigate
complaints from members of the public that they have suffered injustice or
hardship as a result of failure in a service provided by a health authority, or
failure to provide a service which it was its duty to provide, or maladminis¬
tration. Health authorities include regional health authorities, area health
authorities, boards of governors and family practitioner committees. Before
the commissioner can investigate, the complaint must have been brought to
the attention of the authority concerned, and an adequate opportunity given
to investigate it and reply. Matters which are outside his jurisdiction include
action taken solely in the exercise of clinical judgment and the action of general
practitioners and dentists in connection with their general medical and dental
services.
The commissioners report annually, and as they think fit, to the respective
Secretaries of State who lay the reports before each House of Parliament. The
terms of reference of the Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commis¬
sioner for Administration, who at present holds the three posts of Health Ser¬
vice Commissioner, have been expanded to cover these reports (see p. 38).
The health authorities have general responsibility for the prevention of
disease, and co-operate for this purpose with local, water and port authorities,
which have certain specific powers of inspection and control. The local
authorities mainly concerned are in England and Wales the district councils,
the London borough councils and the City of London council; and in Scotland,
till May 1975, county and large burgh councils and, afterwards, new district
and island councils. District community physicians have been appointed with
dual responsibilities to the health authorities and the local authorities, thus
exercising both local government and health authority functions.
In April 1974 the primary responsibility in England and Wales for water con¬
servation and supply and sewerage and sewage disposal, was transferred
under the Water Act 1973 to nine regional water authorities and a Welsh
national development authority (see p. 275), though these may and do use
local authorities as their agents in respect of sewerage. Until May 1975 the
authorities concerned in Scotland with water supply and distribution are
regional water boards, whose members are drawn from town and county
councils. The Central Scotland Water Development Board supplies water in
bulk to the regional water boards in central Scotland. The authorities respon¬
sible for sewerage are the county and burgh councils. From May 1975, the local
authorities responsible for water supply and sewerage will be the new regional
and island councils.
Local authorities, under the new structure, mainly district councils, have
responsibilities and powers to investigate outbreaks of certain specific infec¬
tious diseases and of food poisoning, and to carry out disinfection and various
other preventive measures. Most local authorities have appointed as their
‘proper officer’ to deal with infectious disease and food poisoning, a doctor who
is also a community physician of the health authority, and as such has a general
responsibility for the prevention and control of disease. The same arrange¬
ments also generally apply to the proper officers of the port authorities which

supervise health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of which
is to prevent the introduction of infectious disease into the country.
In April 1974 the area health authorities and health boards took over from the
local authority health departments their planned programmes of vaccination
and immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (women and girls only),
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Such protection is
given either in family doctors’ surgeries, or in health centres or at child health
centres (see p. 137).
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland there is no separate public health laboratory service and
bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern
Ireland a central public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with
hospital laboratories.
The composition, labelling and description of food, food hygiene and the
safety and fitness of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs Act 1955 in
England and Wales, by the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956 in Scotland
and by the Food and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland) 1958 in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales the question of the composition, labelling and descrip¬
tion of food are the concern of food and drugs authorities (county councils,
London borough councils and the City of London council) and questions of
food hygiene and the safety and fitness of food are the concern of district
councils. The Department of Health and Social Security and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible for
giving advice and making regulations. Premises where food or drink is pre¬
pared, handled, transported or sold must conform to certain hygienic stan¬
dards. Authorised officers of the councils may take for analysis or for bac¬
teriological or other examination samples of any food for sale for human
consumption. There are special regulations for milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are till May 1975 the
councils of counties and large burghs. Thereafter regional and island councils
will be responsible for food standards and labelling and district and island
councils for food hygiene.
Local authorities are also responsible for street paving and housing, and the
abatement of noise nuisance. They have power to establish smoke-controlled
areas to secure cleaner air.
Public expenditure on the health services in Britain was estimated at £3,105
million in 1973-74. Most of the cost falls on the Exchequer while the rest is
met from local rates and from the national health service contribution paid
with the national insurance contribution. In addition charges paid by people
using certain services amount to some £98 million.
There are charges for prescriptions (except for children under 16 years,
expectant and nursing mothers, women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and
over, patients suffering from certain medical conditions, war and Service
i34
BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
disablement pensioners, and families with very low incomes, including those
receiving supplementary benefits and family income supplement), for treat¬
ment in the dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment given
to people under 21 years or women who are pregnant or have borne a child in
the past year), for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at school, and
women who are pregnant or have borne a child in the past year), for spectacles
(except children’s standard spectacles) and for certain other articles. Certain
exemptions or refunds are made and help with health service dental and
optical charges can be given under the supplementary benefits scheme to
anyone aged 16 or over whose income is below a certain level. A limited
number of beds may be made available for hospital patients wishing for
privacy, provided that this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds
for non-paying patients; a charge for part of the cost of the accommodation
is made. Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients to be treated
as private patients on payment of the whole cost of their accommodation
and treatment. Such patients may make private arrangements for treatment
by doctors of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners in the National Health Service
are paid according to the number of patients on their list with adjustments to
reflect differences in work and responsibility; certain practice expenses are also
directly reimbursed.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service are paid approved fees for each sight
test made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number
and type of pairs supplied.
PRIMARY HEALTH Primary health care, the front line of the personal health services, is in the
CARE hands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists working within the
service as independent practitioners, and home nurses, midwives and health
visitors employed by the health authorities.
Practitioner The general practitioner services cover the services given to individuals by
Services doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their own choice from among
those taking part in the service.
About 98 per cent of the 25,000 general medical practitioners (principals
and assistants) in Great Britain take some part in the service. The maximum
number of patients’ names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is nor¬
mally 3,500; the average number in Great Britain is about 2,400. It is nor¬
mally through the patient’s own doctor that access to most other parts of the
health service is obtained.
There are about 11,000 dentists in England and Wales and some 1,000 in
Scotland in the general dental service.
Some 900 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 6,000 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and about 70 ophthalmic
medical practitioners and about 700 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in
Scotland are engaged in the general ophthalmic services. These services pro¬
vide for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Patients requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.

There are about 11,500 retail pharmacies under contract to the National
Health Service in Great Britain. They are responsible for the dispensing of all
prescriptions except for the small number dispensed by certain general
practitioners and hospital pharmacies.
Health authorities are under a duty to provide home nurses, midwives and
health visitors, to meet the demand of patients. Home nurses attend to people
needing nursing in their homes or elsewhere outside hospitals. Midwives
assist the family doctor at home confinements (about 7 per cent of all confine¬
ments), and care for mothers and babies (whether born at home or in hospital)
for 14 days after the birth. Health visitors are concerned with the health of the
household as a whole, and have an important part to play in health education
and preventive measures. They work in close co-operation with general
medical practitioners, the pediatric and geriatric wards of hospitals and social
workers.
Increasingly family doctors are working as members of co-ordinated primary
health care teams. About three-quarters of them are in partnership or group
practices, and it is becoming more and more common for home nurses, mid¬
wives and health visitors to work from the larger premises established for such
practices. About ten per cent of doctors now work in health centres which are
built and maintained by the health authorities and which provide modern and
well-equipped accommodation for primary health care teams consisting of
general practitioners and home nurses, midwives and health visitors. Services
frequently provided at health centres include dentistry, chiropody, family
planning, ante-natal care, school health and health education. Occasionally,
when necessary, provision is made for general ophthalmic and pharmaceutical
services. In some cases, a social worker is attached to or co-operates with the
primary health care team. Out-patient facilities for local hospitals may also
be provided. At the end of July 1974, 558 health centres were in operation in
England and Wales, 150 were under construction and many more planned. In
Scotland, there were 57 centres in operation, and 16 under construction with
more planned.
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
facilities for in-patients, day-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity
departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric and geriatric facilities,
rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of specialised treat¬
ment. A number of specialist hospitals for mentally ill, mentally handicapped
and geriatric patients are also provided.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built
in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s Hospitals
in London. Much has been done in recent years to improve and extend existing
hospitals, some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and a number
of new hospitals have been built. In 1962 long-term plans for hospital building
were published by the Government and a revision made in 1966 set out the
probable future pattern of the hospital service and contained assessments of
the work to be undertaken in the ten years ahead. These plans were revised
upwards in 1972.
Nearly 2,500 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are in

England and Wales, including the 25 teaching hospitals in London (actually
groups of hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes, or treatment
centres, numbering over 100 altogether) and the 10 teaching hospitals else¬
where in England and Wales (comprising some 50 hospitals and other estab¬
lishments). They have 428,571 beds available for use and a nursing and
midwifery staff of 207,744 full-time and about 120,746 part-time. There are
355 hospitals in Scotland with some 64,373 beds and nearly 30,615 full-time
and 18,350 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Most of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and Jewish
Hospitals, were set up to serve a special group of patients; others are main¬
tained for the chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations.
Some treat NHS patients under special arrangements. There are also private
nursing homes which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today treatment is
not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions but aims at
helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible. Medical rehabilita¬
tion has been applied with advantage in the care of many patients, including
the chronic sick, the mentally ill, the aged and the handicapped and has
enabled many patients to become self-sufficient and to resume an independent
life in their own homes. Specialised medical rehabilitation facilities are pro¬
vided in the majority of hospitals and at medical rehabilitation centres. The
work is carried out under the supervision of the appropriate medical specialist
by physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists together with
social workers acting as a team. The hospital departments work closely with the
Disablement Resettlement Service of the Employment Service Agency.
Medical rehabilitation includes the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, invalid chairs, certain types of
invalid vehicles, and other appliances. Nursing aids for the handicapped at
home can be borrowed through the service.
Social work help is available to those hospital patients who have difficulties
connected with their illness. Social workers help to solve social and emotional
problems and are concerned with the rehabilitation and resettlement of
patients especially where the illness has been long or where the disability
results in changes in the patient’s life.
The hospital service plays a major part in the treatment of drug dependence,
providing treatment for both in-patients and out-patients either in specialised
drug dependence units or as part of the general psychiatric service. Only
doctors licensed for the purpose by the Home Secretary may prescribe heroin
and cocaine to addicts in the treatment of addiction and all medical practi¬
tioners are required to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the Home Office of
any patient they consider to be addicted to dangerous drugs.
Treatment is provided for alcoholics as part of the general psychiatric service.
In addition a number of specialised hospital units have been set up. Closely
linked with treatment are community services covering prevention, advice to
alcoholics and their families, and rehabilitation including, where necessary,
residential care.
Special preventive health services, including free dental care, are available for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. There are maternity and

child health centres in almost all areas. Special sessions are held for vaccination
and inoculation and for early testing of babies for deafness and other defects.
A feature of the service is the education of mothers before and after the birth
by means of talks, discussion groups, demonstrations and classes. Some 70
per cent of babies are taken to the centres. Family planning advice and help is
provided at many maternity and child health centres and welfare foods (dried
milk and vitamins) are distributed from them.
Whenever possible sick children are treated in their own homes, but for
those that need hospitalisation, many hospitals have children’s departments
under the oversight of pediatricians and specially trained nurses.
The school health service, now part of the National Health Service, com¬
prises medical and dental inspection of school children, medical services con¬
nected with the education of handicapped children, school clinics to treat and
advise on health problems of children of school age and child guidance clinics
to give help and advice about children with mental or emotional problems.
National Health Service family planning clinics and hospitals provide a family
planning service to all irrespective of age, sex, or marital status. Advice is free
as are supplies prescribed and dispensed.
Advice is also available from general medical practitioners who can charge
for the prescription and full cost of supplies. Negotiations with the medical
profession are taking place on the terms on which general practitioners will be
able to prescribe, for non-medical cases, free family planning under the
National Health Service.
The Abortion Act 1967, which came into force in Great Britain in 1968,
permits the termination of a pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner if
two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that its continuance
would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical
or mental health of the pregnant woman or of any children in her family
greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, or if there is a substantial risk
that if a child were born it would be seriously physically or mentally handi¬
capped. Abortions may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals
or in premises approved for the purpose by the Secretary of State concerned.
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is administered
by the new regional health authorities. Donors give their blood voluntarily
without payment. There are two central laboratories administered by the
Medical Research Council on behalf of the Department of Health and Social
Security: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which prepares grouping
serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to it, and the Blood
Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma fractions. In
Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is administered by the Common
Services Agency (see p. 131). In Northern Ireland the Blood Transfusion
Service is operated by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, which
provides a service for all four Health and Social Services Boards.
A Chest Radiological Service, which is freely available, is provided by chest
clinics and the radiological departments of general hospitals. The success of
mass radiography units has been such that their work is being phased into the
hospital radiography service. Mobile X-ray units are still used among especially
susceptible groups.

for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission has been estab¬
lished as an advisory body to the ministers on policy regarding medicines and
a statutory Committee on Safety of Medicines advises the health ministers on
the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines.
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital is provided, where necessary, by the health authorities either directly
or by arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service
(organised by the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade, the British Red
Cross Society, and the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service) augments the
ambulance service in many areas by the conveyance of sitting patients. In
Scotland ambulances are run by the Common Services Agency (see p. 131). In
Northern Ireland they are run by the Health and Social Services Boards.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Health Education Council which assists in the development of programmes of
health education with the health authorities, professional organisations, volun¬
tary bodies and industry. Health education services in Scotland are provided
by the Common Services Agency (see p. 131). Expenditure is met from both
central and local government funds.
Though practically all residents in Britain use the National Health Service, a
number of people sometimes prefer to pay for private consultations and treat¬
ment. Among the major users are the families of the million or so subscribers
to the provident schemes which make provision for private health care in
return for annual subscriptions (now about ^37 million or 2 per cent of the
expenditure on NHS hospital and specialist services).
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers respectively
may practise as doctors and dentists under the National Health Service. Dental
auxiliaries (who have undergone a two-year training course) may carry out
some kinds of simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
The minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven
years’ training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s
experience as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or
more years at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical
profession is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the
dentists is the General Dental Council which succeeded the Dental Board in
1956. The British Medical Association is the doctors’ main professional
association; that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registra¬
tion as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick
children’s, mental or mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a
two-year course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England
and Wales and in Scotland are the General Nursing Councils, and in Northern
Ireland the Northern Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Midwives in
England and Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appro¬
priate Central Midwives Board, and in Northern Ireland of the Northern
Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Most pupil midwives are already
registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year mid¬
wifery training period is reduced to one year and, for other registered and
SOCIAL WELFARE
139

enrolled nurses, to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal
College of Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives.
Health visitors are registered general nurses who have undergone at least the
first part of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking a year’s
course in health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Education and
Training of Health Visitors. Home nurses are state registered or state enrolled
nurses, the majority of whom have undertaken additional training.
To practise as a retail or hospital pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist
must have his or her name entered in the register maintained by the Pharma¬
ceutical Society of Great Britain, the governing body of the profession, or by
the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland. Four or five years’ academic
study and practical training are necessary for registration. The dispensing of
all medicines on doctors’ prescriptions and sale of certain specified medicines
can be carried out only by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharma¬
ceutical chemist. Under the Opticians Act 1958 the General Optical Council
regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician and dispensing optician; only
registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practitioners) may test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes four years including a year of
practical experience under supervision. Dispensing opticians may take a two-
year full-time course with a year’s practical experience or a part-time day-
release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards
(called, for example, the Chiropodists’ Board or the Dietitians’ Board) under
the general supervision of the Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. A professional training lasting two to four years is needed to qualify
for registration. Only members of these professions who are state registered
may be employed in the National Health Service and some other public
services.
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services depart¬
ments of the major local authorities (see p. 65). Many of the services which
they provide are directed towards the same groups of people who also have a
great need for health services, for example, the elderly, the chronically sick and
the disabled and the mentally ill or handicapped. Other groups that are helped
by the local authority social services are young families with social problems,
children deprived of a normal home life and the young offender. Many adults
and children in these groups are also in need of medical and psychiatric
services. Close co-operation is maintained between local and health authorities.
In England and Wales the powers and duties of local authorities to provide
these varied social services derive from a number of statutes; some of the main
Acts are mentioned in their context in the succeeding pages. In Scotland many
of the corresponding duties derive from the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968
in accordance with which Scottish local authorities also undertake duties
similar to those of the separate probation and after-care service in England and
Wales.
A new non-statutory body, the Personal Social Services Council, was
established in 1973 to replace the former advisory councils in the field of
personal social services by a single body. The council has members drawn from
local government, voluntary, educational and research bodies and profes¬
sional organisations. There is cross-representation with the Central Health
Services Council and the Central Council for Education and Training in

Social Work. The council’s functions are to advise ministers on policy issues
and to provide a service of information and advice to all concerned with the
personal social services, based on developmental and research projects or
enquiries which the council will be in a position to sponsor. The council is
financed jointly by central Government and the local authorities and is served
by its own staff.
Local authorities in England and Wales have a duty under the National
Assistance Act 1948 and under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act
1970 to provide social services for people who are blind, partially sighted,
deaf, hard of hearing, or otherwise substantially and permanently handi¬
capped, physically or mentally. Local authorities are required to identify the
number of handicapped people in their area and to publicise services available
to them. A wide range of facilities is available, including advice on occupa¬
tional, social and personal problems arising from disability; assistance in over¬
coming the effects of disability; help in carrying out adaptations in the home—
for example, by fitting ramps, wide doorways, ground floor toilets, guide rails,
and the provision of various aids to living to meet individual needs, including,
in certain circumstances, help towards obtaining a telephone and a television
set; social and occupational centres and clubs; teaching of handicrafts and
other occupations either at home or in centres; the provision of recreational
facilities, outings and holidays including recuperative holidays. They also
provide residential homes for the severely handicapped.
Help available from other sources includes financial aid, preventive and
medical treatment, special education, training for employment and placement
in suitable occupations, specially designed housing and specially designed
means of access to public buildings.
(For the provision of special educational treatment for handicapped children
see p. 150, and the child health centres and the school health service, which
keep a watch for abnormalities, pp. 137 and 148.)
A number of services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by
statutory and voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible.
The services of local authorities include the advice and help of social workers,
domestic help, a chiropody service, sitters-in, night attendants and laundry
services as well as day centres, clubs, recreational workshops and meals services.
In many areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting services are also arranged
by the local authority or a voluntary organisation.
Local authorities also provide residential accommodation for the elderly and
infirm and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisations or
privately. The newer homes provided by local authorities for elderly and
other infirm people usually have accommodation for 30 to 50 residents. About
2,500 homes for elderly people are provided by local authorities in England
and Wales which house about 2 per cent of the population over 65.
For many years local authorities have, under the Housing Acts, provided an
increasing number of smaller dwellings for old people, and flatlets for frail or
infirm old people who can lead independent lives with some help. Local
authorities may contribute towards the cost of employing a warden to under¬
take welfare duties in such specially designed housing.
Local social services authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping
the mentally ill or handicapped in the community, and for prevention and
after-care services. Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness,
which enable patients either to be treated at home or to be discharged from
Help to Families

hospital more quickly provided support is available in the community, are
adding to demands for these services and particularly for social welfare support.
Arrangements include training centres for the mentally handicapped, day care
and occupation centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and a
variety of residential care for the mentally ill and handicapped of all ages. If
necessary, the local authority can place a mentally disordered person under
guardianship within the community. Local authority social workers help
patients and their families to deal with social problems arising from mental
illness or mental handicap.
Local authorities, through their own social workers or through a voluntary
organisation, make available help and advice to families facing special problems.
Domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) is provided by local authori¬
ties. By far the most numerous category getting this help are the elderly, but
others include the chronically sick and severely physically handicapped, the
mentally ill or handicapped and maternity cases.
Some local authorities make direct provision for the special needs of un¬
married mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done
by voluntary organisations and other bodies.
For the homeless, local authorities provide or arrange temporary accommo¬
dation. There were at the end of 1973 about 27,400 people in such accom¬
modation in England.
Local authorities also arrange day care for children under five and not
attending maintained schools, who are in a priority category of need, for
example, with only one parent who has to go out to work. Full-day care is not
usually provided by local authority day nurseries, but local authorities may
place priority children in private or voluntary day nurseries or with registered
child minders.
Local authorities in Britain have a duty of care and protection towards children
who have no parent or guardian willing and able to provide for them and
control them adequately. Local authorities in England and Wales are em¬
powered under the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 to make available
such advice, guidance and assistance as may promote the welfare of children
by diminishing the need to receive or keep them in the authority’s care or to
bring them before a juvenile court. The Children and Young Persons Act
1969 (for England and Wales) provides for children to be brought before a
court if they are neglected, exposed to moral danger, beyond the control of
parents or not attending school or if they have committed an offence and are
in need of care and control; and for the care and treatment of young offenders
and others in need of care and control; and gives local authorities responsi¬
bilities for undertaking, through social workers, enquiries and consultations
with parents, schools and the police, and for the supervision of a child or
young person found to be in need of care and control. Children under 17 who
are charged with offences or brought before the court as being in need of care
or control are almost always dealt with in a juvenile court.
In England and Wales a child may be committed to the care of a local author¬
ity under a care order if the juvenile court is satisfied that he is in need of care
or control. A care order remains in force until a child’s eighteenth birthday (or
nineteenth if made after he is 16) unless revoked earlier by the court. In
England and Wales local authorities have a further duty, under the Children
Act 1948, to receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who has been
abandoned or has no parent or guardian able to provide for him. A child so

received remains in the care of the local authority until he is 18 years old unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends before that time.
Similar provisions for assistance and care apply in Scotland under separate
legislation. Under the provisions of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, the
juvenile courts were replaced by a system of children’s hearings which have
powers to impose compulsory measures of care on a child by means of a super¬
vision requirement which can remain in force until he is 18 years old.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home cannot
be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may be placed in
a community home, a voluntary home or other suitable residential accommo¬
dation. Community homes for children in the care of local authorities are now
provided under plans formulated by regional planning committees in accor¬
dance with the Children and Young Persons Act 1969. These homes comprise
local authority children’s homes and the voluntary homes which have become
‘assisted’ or ‘controlled’ together with former approved schools and remand
homes which have ceased to function under these names. In Scotland local
authorities are responsible for providing appropriate accommodation for
children in their care and informal arrangements exist for the development of
services on a regional basis.
In England and Wales local authority child care functions are the responsi¬
bility of the social services committees appointed under the Local Authority
Social Services Act 1970. In Scotland child care work is undertaken by local
authority social work departments set up under the Social Work (Scotland)
Act 1968. Regulations regarding, for example, conduct of community homes
and registered voluntary homes and the boarding out of children in care are
made for England and Wales by the Secretary of State for Social Services
and the Secretary of State for Wales and, for Scotland, by the Secretary of
State for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland arrangements for young offenders follow the same
general principles as in Great Britain.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. Children’s homes run by voluntary
organisations (with some 12,000 places in Great Britain) are required to be
registered under the Children Act 1948 in England and Wales, in Scotland
under the Social Work (Scotland) Act and in Northern Ireland under the
Children and Young Persons Act. Arrangements for the care of children and
their accommodation are subject to inspection by social work service officers of
the Department of Health and Social Security, the Welsh Office, the Scottish
Education Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Health and
Social Services.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own
homes include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its
Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported
cruelty or neglect.
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926, in
Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. About 25,000 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 400 in
Northern Ireland. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act 1958 in
Great Britain and by the Adoption Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 in Northern

Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted children. In Great
Britain local authorities have had the power since 1959 to act as adoption
agencies and many do so. Adoption societies (over 70 societies arrange
adoptions) must be registered with the local authority.
Adoptions of minors under the laws of most European and Commonwealth
countries are recognised in Great Britain by virtue of the Adoption (Designa¬
tion of Overseas Adoptions) Order 1973. The recognition does not confer on
the adopted person citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies.
Social services of all kinds require for their effective operation professional
social workers, that is, full-time salaried workers trained in the methods
of social work. Most professional social workers are employed in local authority
social services departments, in hospitals, in voluntary organisations or in the
probation service (see p. 107). In England and Wales social workers working
in the health services are employed by local authority social services depart¬
ments and made available by them to hospitals and other health service
establishments. Responsibility for professional training in social work in
Britain rests with the Central Council for Education and Training in Social
Work. Professional training normally takes two years, or one year for certain
students who have previously obtained relevant degrees or diplomas. Advice
in social work training is given by the Social Work Advisory Service.
The services established under the Health and Personal Social Services
(Northern Ireland) Order 1972 correspond fairly closely to the system under
the National Health Service in Great Britain and are financed in the same way
as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
From October 1973 the former tripartite arrangement for the provision of
health and personal social services was replaced by a unified structure in which
these services are provided by four health and social services boards acting as
agents of the Department of Health and Social Services. The services provided
include hospital and specialist services, practitioner and other primary health
care services and personal social services. The boards have under their control
94 hospitals containing in all about 18,000 beds. There are some 750 general
practitioners (with an average of 2,102 patients each), 319 dentists, 12
ophthalmic medical practitioners and 116 ophthalmic and a few dispensing
opticians.
IMMIGRATION AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS
After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from Com¬
monwealth countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa to take up employ¬
ment, many with the intention of settling permanently (see pp. 12 and 338). It
was estimated that coloured Commonwealth immigrants and their families
numbered some 1 -5 million in 1971, about 2^ per cent of the total population
of Britain.
Commonwealth immigrants are making an important contribution to the
economy and public services; but their concentration in areas where opportu¬
nities for employment are greatest—60 per cent have settled in Greater London
and the West Midlands, including Birmingham—led to an increased demand
for housing and additional pressures on some of the social services. The
problems of these inner urban areas are being met by continuous social service
programmes in housing, education, hospitals, health and personal social
144

services, which benefit the whole community, and by several social programmes
which are directed at areas of special need. Additional teachers have been
appointed to schools in immigrant areas and government grants are available
to local authorities with substantial immigrant populations towards the salaries
of extra staff, such as interpreters, health visitors and helpers in schools
and community homes. The welfare of immigrants and good relations between
immigrant groups and the local community are promoted by voluntary
community relations councils and other voluntary bodies.
The co-ordination of government action to promote the welfare of immigrants
is the responsibility of the Home Office. Voluntary efforts to achieve the
integration of immigrants as part of a wider aim of promoting harmonious
community relations are co-ordinated nationally by the Community Relations
Commission, a statutory body set up under the Race Relations Act 1968.
The Commission co-ordinates the activities of local community relations
councils, of which there are about 85 operating in areas where there is an
immigrant population. It makes grants towards the salaries of full-time com¬
munity relations officers and assistants and towards special projects which
help improve community relations and advises and makes recommendations
to the Home Secretary on matters affecting community relations. The Com¬
mission gives specialist advice to those working in social services, including
education, employment and youth services, in the context of a multi-cultural
society.
Discrimination on grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin in places
of public resort was first made unlawful in Great Britain by the Race Relations
Act 1965, which established a Race Relations Board to secure compliance with
the Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 replaced the 1965 Act and is much
wider in scope, making discrimination unlawful in the provision of goods,
facilities and services, in employment and housing and in advertising. The
Race Relations Board has a statutory duty to receive and investigate complaints
and seeks to resolve them by conciliation. The Board constitutes regional
conciliation committees which between them cover all areas of Great Britain.
If conciliation fails the Board can seek remedies in the courts. Employment
complaints are dealt with in the first instance by the Department of Employ¬
ment whose function it is to see whether voluntary machinery exists within
industry to deal with them. Where no such machinery exists the complaints
are investigated by the Board.
7 Education
There are over n million pupils and students in full-time attendance at
schools and institutions of further and higher education in Britain. The great
majority of schools, attended by over 95 per cent of school children, and most
further education establishments are publicly maintained or assisted. Univer¬
sities are autonomous self-governing institutions but are also aided from public
funds.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although some older-established schools and colleges continue to benefit from
private endowments. In 1973-74 estimated total public expenditure on educa¬
tion, including school meals, milk, local libraries and museums, amounted to
over £4,000 million, which was 12 per cent of all public expenditure.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education started over a hundred years ago. In 1833 the Government had
begun to make annual grants to the voluntary societies which were providing
schools, but the Elementary Education Act of 1870 first established the
principle of compulsory education. By the end of the nineteenth century
elementary education had become virtually both compulsory and free of
charge. Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales)
started in England under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now
governs public education in England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern
Ireland educational systems both have long and separate histories, but the
same general policy is implemented throughout Britain, with some national
variations. Education is governed by the Education (Scotland) Act 1962 and
the Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947.
A ten-year education programme for England and Wales was announced by
the Government in December 1972. The proposals involve substantially in¬
creased expenditure in five sectors: a new programme of nursery education
(see p. 148); a larger building programme for the renewal of secondary and
special, as well as primary, schools; a larger teaching force to improve further
the staffing standards in schools; new measures to improve the pre-service and
in-service training of teachers; and the development in higher education of a
wider range of opportunities for both students and institutions. Similar pro¬
posals have been made for Scotland.
Educational Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
Administration four countries of Britain: the Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for all aspects of education in England, for further education in
Wales, and for universities, civil science and the arts (see p. 47) throughout
Great Britain; the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for nursery,
primary and secondary education in Wales; the Secretary of State for Scotland
and the head of the Department of Education in Northern Ireland have full
educational responsibilities in their countries except that the Secretary of
State for Shetland is consulted about Scottish universities but is not respon¬
sible for them.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is divided
between the central government departments (the Department of Education
and Science, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education Department, and the
146
SCHOOLS
Management
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern Ireland Department of Education), local education authorities
(education and library boards in Northern Ireland), and various voluntary
organisations. The relation between these three groups is based on consultation
and co-operation.
The local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and further education and also provide grants to students pro¬
ceeding to higher education. In Scotland grants are paid by the Scottish
Education Department.
In England and Wales colleges of education (for teacher training) are under
the financial and administrative control of local education authorities or
voluntary organisations. The organisation of courses is based on university
institutes of education. The Scottish colleges of education are financed directly
by the Scottish Education Department and administered by independent
governing bodies; in Northern Ireland they are controlled by the Department
of Education or voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent and their governing
bodies are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters or
statutory provisions. The Government exercises its responsibilities in relation
to the universities through the University Grants Committee (see p. 156).
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
At present there are about 10-7 million school children at 37,860 schools.
In England and Wales there were 87 million children in publicly maintained
schools in 1973 besides 130,520 others at schools receiving direct grants from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office; there were
also 425,390 children of all ages at 2,523 independent schools. In Scotland
1,025,310 children were attending education authority or grant-aided schools
and over 17,030 were at independent schools. In Northern Ireland 358,470
children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools.
In Britain boys and girls are generally taught together in primary schools.
Some 74 per cent of pupils in maintained secondary schools in England and
Wales and about 50 per cent in Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In
Scotland nearly all secondary schools are mixed. In the independent sector
most of the schools for younger children are co-educational; but of those
providing secondary education the majority are either for boys or for girls.
Schools supported from public funds are of three kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group), provided and maintained by local
education authorities wholly out of public funds; voluntary schools (mostly
‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools), provided by a voluntary body, usually of a
religious denomination; and direct-grant schools, completely independent of
local education authorities but receiving a grant from the Department of
Education and Science or the Welsh Office. The local education authority is
responsible for the running costs of all voluntary schools and for the cost of
all building work at controlled schools. Aided schools have more independence
than controlled schools and are responsible for part of the cost of external
repairs and any building work (see p. 151). About a third of the 28,330 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary
schools and the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are
2,607 Roman Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to
other religious bodies.
Direct-grant schools (the smallest group) are mainly grammar schools; they

include some schools of ancient foundation. In Scotland most of the schools
supported from public funds are provided by education authorities and are
known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of independent
school, see p. 150). There are also 27 grant-aided secondary schools com¬
parable to the English direct-grant schools. In Northern Ireland controlled
schools, managed by education and library boards and voluntary schools
managed by maintained school committees, boards of governors and individual
(usually clerical) managers, are both grant-aided from public funds.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools (that is, over 94 per cent of the school population) and
books and equipment are free. In Scotland, education authorities have power to
charge fees where this can be done without prejudice to the adequate provision
of free school education.
The direct-grant grammar schools in England and Wales and a few of the
grant-aided secondary schools in Scotland take pupils paid for by local educa¬
tion authorities as well as those whose fees are paid wholly or partly by parents.
In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending grant-
aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where qualified pupils
receive from the education authorities scholarships which cover the whole or
most of the fees charged by the school.
In England and Wales curricula in maintained schools are the responsibility
of the schools’ managers (primary) or governors (secondary). In practice there
is a very high degree of devolution to headteachers. Her Majesty’s Inspectors
of Schools are responsible for the inspection of all schools including inde¬
pendent schools; they review and report on the content and value of the
education provided and are available as advisers. Local education authorities
also employ inspectors to advise on maintained schools. Further advice and
encouragement for school-based research and development is available to
teachers through the Schools Council for Curriculum and Examinations. The
council, an independent body representative of all educational interests, acts
as an advisory body and carries out research and development work on
curricula, teaching methods and examinations in primary and secondary
schools. In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the
same. The content and balance of the curriculum is kept under continuous
review by the Consultative Committee on the Curriculum. Northern Ireland
has a Schools Curriculum Committee which works in close liaison with the
Schools Council; the Inspectorate of the Department of Education provides
help and advice to teachers and is responsible for the inspection and evaluation
of the work of all schools.
The schools’ freedom to frame their own curricula has facilitated a rapid
increase in study and experiment, partly stimulated by the Schools Council
and other organisations and partly prompted by the raising of the school¬
leaving age from 15 to 16 in September 1972. The general purpose is to adapt
the curriculum to the everyday life and needs of children and young people.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and in certain circum¬
stances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of an undenominational
Christian character is given which may include the study of comparative reli¬
gions. In all kinds of voluntary school there is opportunity for denominational

instruction. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the individual conscience,
religious instruction must be given, but the content is determined by educa¬
tion authorities or, more commonly, by the schools themselves. Roman
Catholic children generally have their own schools. In controlled schools in
Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access which may be used for de¬
nominational purposes; in voluntary schools corporate worship and religious
education are controlled by the management authorities.
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
of all schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must
have the use of a playing field and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Organised games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service (which became part of the reorganised National
Health Service in April 1974) provides medical inspection and arranges for
free medical and dental treatment for all children attending schools maintained
by local education authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and
child guidance centres.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to children of 7 years
or under, to children aged between 7 and 12 if they have a medical requirement,
and to pupils in special schools for the handicapped. The School Meals
Service provides a mid-day meal at a subsidised charge (remitted where there
is need). About 66 per cent of pupils in England and Wales, 44 per cent of
pupils in Scotland and 53 per cent of pupils in Northern Ireland in education
authority schools make use of the service. Education authorities have a duty,
under certain conditions, to assist financially in the provision of transport for
pupils between home and school.
The Government has allocated resources under several schemes for the
improvement of educational facilities in ‘priority areas’. Educational problems
in these areas arising from poverty, overcrowding and old school buildings
were highlighted in the Plowden report (see Bibliography p. 468) which made
a number of recommendations on aid to what it defined as educational
priority areas. These recommendations led to the introduction of a special
annual increment for teachers employed in schools of exceptional difficulty
and to the allocation of additional funds for school building in these areas.
Before the proposals for a major expansion in nursery education were an¬
nounced in 1972, over 24,000 additional nursery school places in Great
Britain had been approved in areas of acute social need through the Urban
Programme (see p. 120). The educational share of the Urban Programme has
since been devoted to other uses, for example, the improvement of the links
between home and school, which was recommended in the report on the
educational priority area project (see Bibliography p. 468). This project
(sponsored jointly by the Department of Education and Science and the Social
Science Research Council) and the Community Development Project (spon¬
sored by the Home Office), have encouraged such innovations as community
schools, pre-school experiments and new approaches to adult education. The
education programme announced in 1972 (see p. 145), which included the
provision of more nursery education and the improvement or replacement of
old school buildings, also incorporated as an objective the need to give priority
to the deprived areas.
Nursery schools and classes provide informal educational and play facilities.
Only a small proportion of children between two and five years old attend

these schools but the major expansion of nursery education announced in
December 1972 is planned to provide, within ten years, nursery education
without charge to those children of three and four whose parents wish them
to have it. Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and
Wales go to infant schools or departments; at seven they go on to junior schools
or departments. At present the usual age of transfer from primary to secondary
schools is 11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but an increasing
number of local authorities in England are establishing ‘first’ schools for
pupils aged 5-8 or 10, and ‘middle’ schools for pupils aged 8 or 9 to 12 or 13
and 10 to 13 or 14. In Scotland, the primary schools take children from 5 to 12,
normally having infant classes for children under 7, although in some areas
there are separate infant schools.
The content of curricula is very largely a matter for the schools themselves
(see p. 147). In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are no compulsory
secular subjects but generally a curriculum includes the teaching of reading,
writing, mathematics, English, music, art and handiwork, science and nature
study, history and geography. French is taught in an increasing number of
schools. Additionally, in Wales, the Welsh language is taught. Where it is the
home language of the pupils, Welsh is used as either the main or a secondary
medium of teaching in many schools especially in the early years of primary
school. In Scotland the scope of the curriculum is similar and provision is
made, where appropriate, for the teaching of Gaelic and its use for the
purposes of instruction.
The public or state system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. Just over half the school children in England
and Wales receive their secondary education in schools to which they are
allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11. Schools receiving pupils
on a selective basis are: about 995 grammar schools providing academic
education (including 176 direct-grant grammar schools); some 1,915 secondary
modern schools giving a general education with a practical bias; a few secondary
technical schools offering a general education related to industry, commerce
and agriculture; and schools providing all three, or any two, types of education,
in separately organised streams and known as multilateral or bilateral schools.
Nearly a half of the maintained secondary school population, however,
attend some 1,835 comprehensive schools which take pupils without reference
to ability or aptitude and provide a wide range of secondary education for all or
most of the children of a district. They can be organised in a number of ways
including schools that take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18;
the middle schools whose pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at
12 or 13, leaving at 16 or 18; and the comprehensive school with an age-range
of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-form college for pupils over 16.
In 1974 the Government announced plans to encourage progress towards a
fully comprehensive system of secondary education.
Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised on compre¬
hensive lines and in 1973 306,000 pupils (about 90 per cent of all pupils in
education authority secondary schools) were in schools with a comprehensive
intake. The majority of schools are six-year comprehensive schools. Because
of local circumstances there are some comprehensive schools whose courses
may extend to four years or less and from which pupils may transfer at the
end of their second or fourth years to a six-year comprehensive school.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools and secondary (intermediate)
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
schools, the latter being the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in
England and Wales. Some comprehensive type schools exist, and arrangements
for transfer between the other types of schools are flexible.
Special education is provided for children who require it because of physical
or mental disability, including maladjustment, either in ordinary schools or
special schools (including hospital schools).1 There are over 1,730 special
schools in Britain, including hospital schools, day and boarding schools. There
are also boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
There are ten categories of handicapped pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and nine in Scotland for whom local education authorities
must provide special educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf,
partially hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal (mentally handicapped in
Scotland), epileptic, maladjusted, physically handicapped and children suffer¬
ing from speech defects. There is no separate category for the delicate in
Scotland. As many children have multiple handicaps there is a growing
tendency to relate educational needs to overall medical condition and to use
the system of categories for administrative purposes only.
Independent schools in England and Wales receive no grants from public
funds but all are open to inspection and must register with the Department of
Education and Science or the Welsh Office which has power to require them to
remedy any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or in¬
struction and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be
the proprietor of a school. In default, the appropriate Secretary of State can,
in effect, close a school, but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent
Schools Tribunal against any of the requirements. The schools whose stan¬
dards are regarded by the Department or the Welsh Office as broadly com¬
parable with those of well-run maintained schools are, on application, granted
the status of ‘recognised as efficient’. Such schools (1,390 of 2,523 independent
schools registered) contain 75-2 per cent of the pupils in independent schools.
In Scotland where there are 107 registered schools, the position is generally the
same except that there is no ‘recognised as efficient’ status. In Northern
Ireland there are only four independent schools; these have to be registered
with the Department of Education for Northern Ireland and be open to
inspection. As in England and Wales they receive no grants from public funds.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages and abilities. They include
the preparatory schools and the public schools.2 The preparatory schools cater
mainly for boys from about 8 to 13 years of age who hope to enter public
schools, the largest and most important of the ‘recognised as efficient’ inde¬
pendent schools. Combined tuition and boarding fees in public schools
generally range between ^750 and £1,200 a year. There are some 250 public
schools about half of which are for girls. The boys’ schools in particular include
a high proportion of boarding schools and it is among these that some of the
most famous schools are numbered.
1 The setting up of an inquiry into educational provision for handicapped children in
England, Wales and Scotland was announced in 1973-
2 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. Some other schools, mainly direct grant, which are not
independent schools, are also represented on these bodies. They should not be confused
with the state-supported public schools in Scotland.

EDUCATION 15I
The minimum school-leaving age is 16, but the numbers choosing to stay on
beyond this age have shown a steady increase over the past decade.
There is no national school-leaving examination in England and Wales, but
secondary school pupils may attempt examinations, in various subjects, leading
to the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or the General Certificate of
Education (GCE). The CSE is designed for pupils completing five years’
secondary education and is normally taken at the age of 16. It is controlled by
14 Regional Examining Boards, consisting mainly of teachers serving in the
schools which provide the candidates. The highest grade in the CSE is widely
accepted as being of the same standard as a pass at GCE ‘Ordinary’ level.
Control over the scope and standards of the examinations is exercised by the
Schools Council (see p. 147) to ensure national comparability. The GCE is
conducted at ‘Ordinary’ (O) and ‘Advanced’ (A) levels. Normally candidates
taking ‘O’ level are about 16 years of age, although some take it earlier, at the
discretion of their head teacher. Most pupils in grammar, direct grant and
independent schools take the ‘O’ level examination, and so do a number of
pupils in comprehensive and other secondary schools.
Passes in various subjects at GCE ‘O’ level and the equivalent CSE grade
are usually considered to be qualifications for entry to courses of further educa¬
tion and training. Since the inception of the CSE the number of passes at the
highest grade has increased steadily as the popularity of the examination has
grown while the annual number of GCE ‘O’ level subject passes has also
increased. The ‘A’ level examination is at the standard for entrance to university
and for entry to many forms of professional training. Since 1955 the number
of school-leavers obtaining two or more ‘A’ levels (the minimum qualification
for entry to first degree courses at university) has more than trebled. Entries
for both levels of the GCE are accepted from candidates at further education
establishments and from candidates entering privately.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of
Education Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth
year are presented for the Higher grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the
basis for entry to university or professional training. For those who have
completed their main studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their
studies in particular subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education or the Northern Ireland Certificate of Secondary
Education, which are equivalent to those examinations in England and
Wales.
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central
departments decide on the size and nature of the authorities’ individual
programmes in the light of national priorities; they also offer guidance to
authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
Since 1945 an extensive school building programme has been carried out
resulting in the completion of about 15,000 new schools in Britain, together
with extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing state schools; over
8 million new places have been provided.
Grants of up to 80 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office for the building

of new voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to
existing aided schools.
In Northern Ireland capital grants of 80 per cent are available for voluntary
schools managed by maintained school committees and voluntary grammar
schools which have entered into an agreement under the relevant statutory
provisions.
The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods in
design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been widely
adopted. The new schools are light, airy and colourful, well equipped and with
a generous provision of teaching area and outdoor games space. In primary
schools especially, traditional classroom designs are being modified to allow
more flexible use of space.
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
bodies or managers. In 1973 there were about 455,890 full-time and 52,760
part-time (equivalent to 24,510 full-time) teachers in publicly maintained
schools in Britain, an average of one teacher to 21*9 pupils. The supply of
teachers is increasing rapidly and the pupil-teacher ratio is improving each
year. Increasing numbers of university graduates are turning to teaching.
In 1973 the Advisory Committee on the Supply and Training of Teachers
was set up to advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science on the
supply and training of teachers for maintained schools and establishments of
further education in England and Wales. In 1973 there were 68,620 full-time
teachers in grant-aided establishments of further education in Britain, and
many more part-time teachers. There is also an increased use of teachers’ aides
(helpers) particularly in primary schools, while the rapid growth in the number
of teachers’ centres (some 550) has helped the spread of new ideas in teaching
practice. Most teachers in technical colleges have had industrial and pro¬
fessional experience.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland.
Further education is a broad term used to cover education beyond the second¬
ary stage; it includes much vocational education (full-time, part-time day or
evening courses), non-vocational and recreational evening classes, and adult
education. Further education advanced courses constitute one of the three
sectors of higher education (see p. 155 and below).
In England and Wales there are about 625 major establishments of further
education including polytechnics (see p. 159), technical colleges, colleges of
commerce, colleges of art, and a number of agricultural establishments. They
provide both full-time and part-time courses up to the levels of first and higher
degrees. There are also over 6,360 evening institutes (see p. 154).
In Scotland there are about 75 local further education colleges offering
full- and part-time day courses and a number of evening courses and 13 central
institutions for further education doing mainly advanced work.
In Northern Ireland there are 27 institutions of further education.
Since most further education establishments in Britain are either maintained
or aided from public funds, tuition fees are moderate, and nearly always
remitted for young people under 18 years of age. Where industrial training is
provided by the colleges, charges (the responsibility of the employer) broadly

reflect the economic cost of provision. Many full-time students are helped by
awards from local education authorities. The awards, generally based on the
results of the General Certificate of Education or a corresponding examination,
are assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who
can afford to contribute towards the cost are required to do so. There are also
some scholarships available from endowments, and from particular industries
or companies for the most promising of their young workers.
In autumn 1972, there were 344,939 full-time and sandwich-course stu¬
dents (307,000 in England and Wales, 26,077 in Scotland and 11,862 in
Northern Ireland) and 1,638,424 part-time students in vocational further
education (1-5 million in England and Wales, 115,285 in Scotland and 23,139
in Northern Ireland). The total number of students on advanced courses in
England and Wales was about 208,700, in Scotland 19,043, and in Northern
Ireland 2,692.
The courses provided are full-time, sandwich (up to five years in length,
generally consisting of alternate periods of about six months of full-time study
in a technical college and supervised experience in industry), block release (on
similar principles, but with shorter periods in college), day release (generally
attendance at a technical college for one day a week during working hours),
and evening classes.
Sandwich courses in higher education are becoming increasingly popular.
At the lower levels the numbers of day release and block release courses are
expanding, and to a large extent replacing evening classes in certain vocational
subjects. Many students attend courses in which further education and in¬
dustrial training are combined.
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and occu¬
pations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of up to five
years. Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates and
Diplomas awarded by joint committees consisting of representatives of edu¬
cation departments, teacher organisations and the appropriate professional
bodies. The Technician Education Council was set up in 1973 with overall
responsibility for developing a unified system of courses for technicians in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, leading to awards which will eventually
replace those of the joint committees. A similar council has been established
in Scotland. Courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The
Ordinary National Certificate (ONC) courses normally last two years part-
time and students usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19; the level
of the certificate is generally considered to approach that of GCE ‘A’ level.
The Ordinary National Diploma (OND) courses are the full-time or sandwich
counterparts of the ONC but involve study to a greater depth. The Higher
National Diploma (HND), which requires a further two years’ full-time or
three years’ sandwich study, is recognised, within its more restricted field, as
approaching the standard of a pass degree; the Higher National Certificate
(HNC), after two further years’ part-time study, is lower in standard because
it is more narrowly based.
Many technical colleges, evening institutes and independent colleges offer
courses in shorthand, typing and book-keeping. Most local technical colleges
offer some lower-level work in business and commerce; higher-level work is
generally concentrated in colleges with a department of business studies or in
specialised colleges of commerce. There are a number of part-time and full¬
time courses leading to the Certificate or Higher Certificate in Office Studies.
I54
BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; large numbers of the candidates taking
such courses do so through correspondence courses. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland there are part-time courses leading to the ONC and HNC
in Business Studies. There are also full-time and sandwich courses leading to
the OND and HND in Business Studies. A Business Education Council was
established in 1974 with the same functions as the Technician Education
Council (see above) in relation to courses of business education. In Scotland,
similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish Higher
National Certificate and the Scottish National Diploma in Business Studies,
awarded by the Scottish Business Education Council.
Adult Education Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of non-vocational education
for people over 18.1 In 1973 some 2-2 million people registered for these courses
which were provided by local education authorities, various voluntary bodies,
of which the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) is the most notable,
certain residential colleges, and the adult education (‘extra-mural’) depart¬
ments of universities.
The residential colleges, the university departments and the voluntary
bodies, such as the WEA, recognised as competent to provide adult education,
receive government grants. So do various national bodies which promote
educational activities of a non-political kind, such as the National Federation of
Women’s Institutes and the National Council of Young Men’s Christian
Associations. Many of these bodies also receive grants from local education
authorities for services rendered locally.
A major part of adult education is provided by local education authorities.
Most of it is on a part-time basis, mainly in evening institutes (day schools
used by adults in the evening) and increasingly by day as well as in the evening
in colleges of further education, schools of art, adult education centres, com¬
munity centres, literary institutes and youth clubs. About 1 -8 million students
attended local authority adult education classes in 1973. There are about 24
short-term residential colleges or centres in England and Wales, most main¬
tained or aided by local education authorities, providing courses varying in
length between a weekend and a fortnight. Many of the courses are practical,
but there are widespread opportunities for academic study.
The village colleges pioneered in Cambridgeshire and variously adapted
as community schools and colleges, at first in rural, but now also in urban areas,
are secondary schools planned as cultural community centres, providing educa¬
tional, social and cultural opportunities for the whole community. Community
centres have a more social character and, though aided financially by the local
education authorities, are usually managed by voluntary community associa¬
tions many of which are affiliated to the National Federation of Community
Associations. The training of community centre wardens is linked with that
of youth workers (see p. 164).
Long-term residential colleges (6 in England and Wales, 1 in Scotland)
provide courses of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The
colleges aim to provide a liberal education and do not apply academic entry
tests.
In general, part-time courses of more academic studies are provided by the
1 Recommendations for changes in the provision of adult education in England and
Wales, made by a committee of inquiry (see Bibliography p. 468), are being considered
by the Government. A similar committee of inquiry for Scotland is expected to report
towards the end of 1974.

extra-mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time staff
appointed for this purpose and can also call on the services of other members
of the university staff; and by the Workers’ Educational Association, which also
employs organising tutors and works closely with the university extra-mural
departments. In 1972-73 some 300,000 students in Britain attended such
courses. Similar work is promoted in some education authority centres.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
Wales which are interested in this subject. It is mainly financed by contribu¬
tions from local education authorities and assisted by a grant from the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science. The Scottish Institute of Adult Education is
the corresponding body in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland extra-mural departments of the Queen’s University of
Belfast and the New University of Ulster organise and staff adult education
classes which are supplemented by classes organised by various non-official
bodies. The Workers’ Educational Association is responsible for classes at
other than university level and receives grants from the Department of
Education and the education and library boards.
In 1973-74 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) broadcast 84 radio
series for schools including nine series for Wales, nine for Scotland, and four
for Northern Ireland. These programmes were used by about 92 per cent of
all schools. Television reached some 80 per cent of all schools and the BBC
and the Independent Broadcasting Authority between them transmitted 94
series of educational programmes, most of which were repeated.
Radio provides a great variety of educational programmes for adults, both
vocational and non-vocational; most of them are grouped in an hourly study
programme on five nights a week. Television programmes for similar audiences
are mostly shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings and in the evening during
the week. Radio and television form a major part of the Open University’s
courses (see p. 156) and in 1973 the BBC produced 520 hours of radio and
606 hours of television in support of 42 courses prepared by the Open Uni¬
versity. There have also been a number of experimental projects sponsored
between the BBC, some of the independent television companies, universities
and local education authorities.
A number of other audio-visual aids are in use throughout the educational
system. Most universities and a high proportion of colleges of education use
closed-circuit television; it is also used increasingly in further education
colleges and schools—the Inner London Education Authority’s system links
about 1,400 educational establishments and is one of the world’s biggest net¬
works. There are about 3,000 language laboratories in use in schools and
institutions of further and higher education in England and Wales.
Schools and colleges co-ordinate different methods of audio-visual presenta¬
tion, including radio, television, films, colour slides, wall charts, maps, models
and tape recordings. For example, the BBC’s ‘Radiovision’ programmes for
schools use coloured film strips in conjunction with a tape recording of the
broadcast. The Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom
and the Educational Foundation for Visual Aids advise all bodies connected
with education and with training in industry and in the Services on the use of
audio-visual aids.
The system of higher education includes universities, colleges of education
and advanced courses at various colleges in the further education system
156 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
particularly the polytechnics. There has been a rapid expansion in higher
education in the last decade; the numbers in full-time higher education in
Britain have increased from 222,400 in 1962 to 483,387 in 1972-73. This
expansion has been achieved by increasing the number of universities; by
concentrating much of the advanced work in further education establishments
in the polytechnics and thus providing opportunities for students to gain a
degree outside a university; by introducing new courses leading to a Bachelor
of Education (B.Ed) degree; and by the establishment of the Open University
which provides people, with or without formal qualifications, with the
opportunity of studying for a degree.
Universities There are 44 universities (not counting the Open University) in Britain, com¬
pared with 17 in 1945. Although the Government is responsible for providing
about 90 per cent of universities’ income it does not control their work or
teaching nor does it have direct dealings with the universities. The grants are
distributed by the University Grants Committee, a body appointed by the
Secretary of State for Education and Science to advise on state aid to the
universities; its members are drawn from the academic and business worlds.
The English universities are: Aston1 (Birmingham), Bath,1 Birmingham,
Bradford,1 Bristol, Brunei1 (London), Cambridge, City1 (London), Durham,
East Anglia,1 Essex,1 Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury,1 Lancaster,1
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough,1 Manchester, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford,1 Sheffield, Southampton,
Surrey,1 Sussex,1 Warwick1 and York.1 The federated University of Wales
includes five university colleges, the Welsh National School of Medicine, and
the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology. The Scottish
universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,1 Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt1
(Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling,1 and Strathclyde1 (Glasgow). In Northern
Ireland there is the Queen’s University of Belfast, and the New University of
Ulster1 in Coleraine (see p. 159).
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
There are five other institutions where the work is of university standard:
the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology; the two
postgraduate business schools which are supported jointly by industry and the
Government—the Manchester Business School and the London Graduate
School of Business Studies; Cranfield Institute of Technology for mainly post¬
graduate work in aeronautics and other subjects; and the Royal College of Art.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-
time degree and other courses, using a combination of television and radio
broadcasts, correspondence courses and summer schools, together with a net¬
work of viewing and listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are
required to register for these courses, but the standards of its degrees (which
are awarded on a system of credits for each course completed) are the same as
those of other universities. The university is financed by fees and a direct
grant from the Department of Education and Science. The first courses began
in January 1971 and in July 1974 some 42,170 students were following courses.
University Finance In spite of the large sums of public money spent on universities they have
remained autonomous institutions, due largely to the existence of the Univer-

sity Grants Committee. The Committee acts as a link between the Government
from which it receives a block grant and the universities to which it allocates
this grant. In this way the Government contributes about 90 per cent towards
both the current income of universities and towards their capital programmes
for building work, purchasing sites and properties, professional fees and
furniture and equipment. Further sums are raised by the universities.
In Great Britain the recurrent grants for the academic year 1974-75 are
estimated to be about .£33 r million. Capital grants are expected to be about
£11-5 million. Total public expenditure on universities rose from £4 million
in 1945 to £426 million in 1973-74. The Comptroller and Auditor General
(see p. 357) has access to the books and records of the University Grants
Committee and the universities to check that the funds entrusted to the
universities are efficiently administered. He cannot question policy decisions
or those reached on academic grounds.
Courses in arts and science are offered by most universities. Imperial College,
London, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
and some of the newer universities concentrate on technology although they
also offer a number of courses in social studies, modern languages and other
non-technological subjects. About 50 per cent of full-time university students
in Great Britain are taking arts or social studies courses and 35 per cent science
and technology: about 12 per cent are studying medicine, dentistry and health,
and the remainder agriculture, forestry, veterinary science, architecture and
town and country planning.
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science five or six years are required.
The first degree of Bachelor (Master in the arts faculties of the older Scottish
universities and in Dundee) is awarded on the completion of such a course,
depending on satisfactory examination results. Further study or research is
required at the modern universities for the degree of Master and by all
universities for that of Doctor. Actual degree titles vary according to the
practice of each university. A uniform standard of degree throughout the
country is ensured by having external examiners on all examining boards. In
the last decade there has been a tendency for degree courses to become more
broadly based in subject matter, particularly in the new universities. A recent
innovation has been the introduction of ‘modular’ degree courses which
provide more flexibility for students in their choice of courses.
University teaching combines lectures, practical classes (in scientific sub¬
jects) and small group teaching in either seminars or tutorials.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research.
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with
men but at Cambridge their numbers may be limited by ordinance. The general
proportion of men to women students is less than three to one; at Oxford it is
over four to one, and at Cambridge seven to one. Just under a half of all full¬
time university students in Britain are living in colleges and halls of residence,
over one-third are in privately rented accommodation, and the remainder live
at home.
Prospective candidates for nearly all the universities apply for places through
the Universities Central Council on Admissions. The only students to apply
directly are applicants to the Open University and British candidates who
apply only to the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1973-74 there were about 244,480 full-time university students in Great
Britain including 46,100 postgraduates. In 1972-73 there were some 22,625
part-time students. Some 32,170 home and overseas candidates were also
registered in 1974 for London University’s external first degree examinations.
In 1972-73 there were about 35,595 full-time university teachers in Great
Britain; about 10*5 per cent of them were professors. The ratio of staff to
students was about one to eight, one of the most favourable in the world.
Teachers in maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the
education departments. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland the majority
qualify by undertaking a three-year course at a college of education.1 Some
college students obtain a degree—Bachelor of Education (B.Ed)—and a
professional qualification by means of a four-year course. A one-year course of
professional training for newly qualified people with degrees and certain other
specialist qualifications, hitherto entitled to teach without further training, is
now compulsory for teachers of all subjects in primary schools and for all
subjects in secondary schools except, temporarily, mathematics and science
where a shortage exists.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority and grant-aided primary
and secondary schools must be registered with the General Teaching Council
for Scotland. Secondary school teachers must be graduates (or have equivalent
qualification) and have taken a course of teacher training at a college of
education. Primary school teachers, if graduate, take a one-year course of
teacher training or, if non-graduate, a three-year course at a college of educa¬
tion. Most Scottish colleges of education also offer courses leading to the
degree of Bachelor of Education.
In England and Wales there are 154 colleges of education, 14 of which are
for day students only, 7 departments of education in polytechnics, 30 university
departments of education, 4 colleges for training teachers for technical institu¬
tions and 13 art teacher training centres. In October 1973 there were about
113,600 students in colleges and departments of education outside universities
(including nearly 6,900 in day colleges), some 6,600 in university departments
of education, and 2,700 in colleges of education (technical) and art teacher train¬
ing centres. In Scotland there are 10 colleges of education; the number of
students in training in 1973-74 was over 14,000.
The education departments, universities, local authorities and other bodies
provide a variety of short in-service training courses for practising teachers.
In 1972-73 over 222,000 students in Great Britain were taking advanced
courses other than in universities and colleges of education in a wide variety
of subjects including architecture, art and design (see p. 424), catering, engin¬
eering, natural sciences and business and management studies. An increasing
proportion of the students were taking courses leading to the awards of the
Council for National Academic Awards. The council has power to award
degrees and other academic qualifications, comparable in standard with those
granted by universities, to students who successfully complete approved
courses of study in establishments which do not have the power to award
their own degrees. In 1973-74 there were 603 courses being followed by about
41,650 students. These courses were mainly in science and technology but

training (see p. 145) based on the recommendations made by the James committee of

included the arts, social studies, business studies and law. In 1974 the council
approved its first teacher training courses including some leading to the B.Ed
degree.
In England and Wales higher education provision outside universities and
colleges of education is being concentrated within 30 major national institutions
named ‘polytechnics’. They are comprehensive institutions providing all types
of courses (full-time, sandwich, and part-time) at all levels of higher education.
In Scotland similar provision is made in 13 central institutions and a few
further education colleges managed by education authorities.
Management studies are provided by universities, polytechnics and other
further education colleges, by individual companies and by trade and industrial
federations. (For the two postgraduate business schools, see p. 156.) Certain
independent colleges specialise in management training. Many universities
have introduced management studies into the curriculum. Courses for the
postgraduate Diploma in Management Studies are run by about 80 colleges.
In Scotland courses leading to the Certificate of Business Administration are
provided for students in junior supervisory positions.
Awards to enable students to undertake higher education are made under one
of the most generous grant systems in the world. It is national policy that no
school leaver should be prevented by lack of means from taking an advanced
course at a university or elsewhere. As a result, over 90 per cent of students in
higher education in Great Britain are aided from public funds.
In England, Wales and Scotland most adequately qualified British students
can obtain awards from public funds in order to attend full-time at a university,
college of education or major further education establishment. In England and
Wales local education authorities provide awards. In Scotland students’
allowances for advanced courses are granted by the Scottish Education De¬
partment. The amount of these awards depends upon the income of the
student and his parents. Grants for postgraduate study are offered annually
by the Department of Education and Science, the Research Councils and the
Scottish Education Department.
Two institutions provide university education in Northern Ireland—the
Queen’s University of Belfast and the New University of Ulster, Coleraine.
The New University consists of four schools (biological studies, social and
economic studies, physical sciences and humanities) and an education centre
with the status of a school. Technological studies are provided at the Queen’s
University of Belfast, in addition to a wide range of courses in other faculties.
In October 1973 there were 5,500 students at the Queen’s University and
1,560 at the New University. Government grants to the universities are made
by the Department of Education which first seeks the advice of the University
Grants Committee.
Higher education outside the universities is mainly centred in a new poly¬
technic called Ulster College which has 1,824 full-time and 2,090 part-time
students.
Teacher training takes place in the two university education departments,
three colleges of education, the Ulster College and one technical college. In
1973-74 there were about 3,233 students in training. The principal courses are
three-year (certificate) and four-year (Bachelor of Education) but there are also
one-year courses for graduates or holders of other appropriate qualifications.
University and further education scholarships are awarded by the education
and library boards and postgraduate awards and teacher-training scholarships

Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of edu¬
cational services is supported financially by the education departments, local
education authorities, philanthropic organisations, universities and teachers’
associations. The Schools Council and the Social Science Research Council are
additional channels for government support.
The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the universi¬
ties, is the National Foundation for Educational Research, an autonomous
body which derives its income mainly from corporate members, including local
education authorities, teachers’ organisations and universities and from an
annual grant from the Department of Education and Science. There are also
the Scottish Council for Research in Education and the Northern Ireland
Council for Educational Research.
Some research is undertaken at colleges of education and polytechnics and
by a few independent research organisations.
Among philanthropic organisations that provide generously for research are
the Nuffield Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Gulbenkian Trust, the
Leverhulme Trust, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, the Rockefeller Founda¬
tion, the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, the Wolfson Foundation and the
Foundation for Management Education.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and for
British students to study abroad and some British teachers serve overseas for a
period.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer educational
ties with other member countries. Both at school level and in the colleges and
universities there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and
languages. Post-to-post exchanges of teachers have been encouraged by
Government sponsored schemes and ultimately 1,000 teacher exchanges a
year are planned. These schemes are administered by the Central Bureau for
Educational Visits and Exchanges which also makes appointments available to
European teachers wishing to teach in Britain and negotiates posts on an in-
service training basis for British teachers wishing to further their experience
in another European country. Opportunities for students from the Community
to study at higher education institutions in Britain have increased under the
European Fellowship Scheme, initiated by Britain, for the provision of Euro¬
pean Fellowships for postgraduate study. Britain has also adhered to the Statute
of the European Schools (six of which have been established throughout the
Community) to provide school education for children of people employed in
the European Community institutions. Negotiations are in progress to establish
common standards of professional qualification which will enable qualified
people to practise anywhere in the Community.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1972-73 there were about 82,830 overseas students in
Britain, of whom about 22,410 were at universities, another 22,240 at technical
colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers, nurses, for
the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 49 per cent of all over¬
seas students were from the Commonwealth.

Arrangements
for Overseas
Students
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers from
other countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan,
the governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards avail¬
able at their own institutions of higher education to men and women from other
Commonwealth countries. At the beginning of the academic year 1973-74.
632 scholarships and fellowships (including medical awards) were held in
Britain under the plan. The Commonwealth Education Fellowship Scheme
provides opportunities for further training, study and research for teachers and
others with appropriate experience. There are 550 study fellowships tenable
for periods of between 3 months and 3 years.
About 500 British Council1 scholarships tenable usually for one year in
Britain, and 24 British Council Fellowships tenable for two to three years, are
offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Thirty Marshall Scholar¬
ships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are offered annually by
the British Government to graduates from the United States of America and
over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to Commonwealth and
United States graduates for two years of study at the University of Oxford. A
further two Rhodes Scholarships are awarded to graduates from the Federal
Republic of Germany. Other universities and colleges themselves offer many
scholarships for which graduate students of any nationality are eligible.2
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are available
under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo Plan, the Special Com¬
monwealth African Assistance Plan and British technical assistance pro¬
grammes for many countries. Over 1,400 awards for study or training in
Britain are also made under the United Nations Programmes of Technical
Assistance and by the United Nations specialised agencies such as UNESCO,
FAO, and WHO.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth, and
regular Commonwealth education conferences are held.
The national representatives in London (Office of the High Commissioner or
Embassy) of a number of countries accept certain special responsibilities for
their students in Britain. The British Council acts as an agent for the British
Government in matters affecting the welfare of overseas students, and provides
1 The purpose of the British Council (founded in 1934) is defined in its Royal Charter as
the promotion of a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language
abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between Britain and otber
countries. The council is governed by an executive committee of 30 members, broadly
representative of many elements of the life of Britain, and including eight members
nominated by ministers. It is financed almost entirely from public funds. The activities
of the council, which has staff in 8a overseas countries, are advising and assisting in
English teaching and other educational work including science; fostering personal
contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational, professional
and scientific fields; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of British books and
periodicals overseas; and presenting overseas the best in the arts in Britain. Its work in
Britain is concerned mainly with professional visitors and with the welfare of overseas

for Commonwealth University Staff (see Bibliography p. 467) and Scholarships Guide
for Commomuealth Postgraduate Students, which includes information about sources of
financial aid available for use in Britain. The Association promotes co-operation between
Commonwealth universities. Its activities include the provision of publication and in¬
formation services, and of secretariats for various bodies affecting its member institutions,
such as the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission and the Marshall Aid Commemora¬
tion Commission.

certain, services, such as meeting on arrival, introduction courses, an accom¬
modation bureau and a student centre in London which organises a varied
programme of lectures, discussions and social and other activities and arranges
introductions of students to people who wish to invite them to their homes. In
the vacations there are courses in many parts of the country which offer oppor¬
tunities for getting to know more about British life in town and country. In
term time there are visits to various places of interest, and theatre and concert
parties are arranged.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are Rotary, Round Table, the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas
League, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National Union of Students,
the English-Speaking Union and Churches of all denominations. The United
Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs, established in 1968, is an
independent central body serving overseas students and organisations and
individuals concerned in overseas students affairs; it provides both a forum for
the exchange of ideas and machinery for consultation with government and
other authorities. In many London boroughs and in other large cities there are
committees which help students to make contact with local residents and
organisations. These organisations also help by entertaining overseas students
and many of them have established hostels with the financial help of the Over¬
seas Students Welfare Expansion Programme which is administered by the
British Council. By the beginning of 1974 grants had been approved for 160
projects, providing places for about 6,500 students.
In 1973-74, 31 awards were accepted by British students in eight Common¬
wealth countries under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan
(see p. 161). In addition the Study and Serve Scheme, administered by the
Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas, enables British
students to spend two years in a developing country, the time being devoted
equally to study, which may or may not lead to a postgraduate qualification,
and service, usually in the form of university employment in the country
concerned.
The United States-United Kingdom Educational Commission (still some¬
times called the Fulbright Commission) offers travel grants for postgraduate
study in the United States. Notable among more recently established scholar¬
ships are the Kennedy scholarships, to enable British students to study at three
American universities, and the Churchill travel scholarships, for men and
women in all walks of life. British students are also offered scholarships at
institutions of higher education in many European and non-European
countries outside the Commonwealth.
Teachers About 1,265 teachers were recruited in Britain during 1973 for posts in schools,
Serving colleges of education, technical colleges and universities in developing coun-
Overseas tries, including about 1,115 f°r posts in the developing countries of the
Commonwealth; almost all of them are supported by public funds. Recruit¬
ment is carried out by the Ministry of Overseas Development, the British
Council and the voluntary teacher recruiting agencies, such as the Overseas
Appointments Bureau and Catholic Overseas Appointments. Some develop¬
ing countries carry out their own recruitment of British teachers through their
offices in London.
During 1973 about 1,510 British teachers served in universities in developing
countries, most of them recruited through the Inter-University Council for
Higher Education Overseas and the Association of Commonwealth Univer-

sities and the British Council. Government encouragement also includes sup¬
port for a number of schemes of assistance for overseas universities which are
administered by the Inter-University Council, including the scheme for Special
Commonwealth Awards, which are made to leading scholars from British
universities who are willing to work for a minimum of two years in important
posts in the universities of developing Commonwealth countries.
Outside these schemes, four voluntary organisations, co-ordinated under the
British Volunteer Programme (BVP), recruit graduate and qualified volunteers
and a few cadet volunteers for service overseas. Of the 2,705 overseas in 1973,
1,829 were teachers. The BVP receives financial assistance from the Govern¬
ment.
Schemes under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for a year with
teachers overseas include one with the United States and another with Com¬
monwealth countries involving each year about 200 British teachers.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for temporary assistants’ posts for language
specialists. The largest of these schemes is the modern languages assistants’
scheme, administered by the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and
Exchanges, which enables students and young teachers to serve overseas,
particularly in Europe, and for their counterparts to serve in Britain.
Several schemes designed to assist interchange between institutions of higher
education in Britain and overseas countries through staff visits are adminis¬
tered by the British Council. Study and research visits by British and overseas
scholars are supported through programmes of the British Academy, the
Royal Society, the Science Research Council, and other British and inter¬
national bodies.
Britain provides, on request, assistance to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for technical and con¬
sultant services and specialist missions, through various educational organisa¬
tions and the Ministry of Overseas Development. In 1974 the Centre for
Educational Development Overseas, which was concerned with the modernisa¬
tion of education in developing countries was amalgamated with the British
Council which has assumed responsibility for the centre’s work.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service is to help young people to broaden their interests,
to enjoy recreational pursuits, and to mix socially in their leisure time.
The service (which in Scotland forms part of the Youth and Community
Service) is provided by local education authorities and voluntary organisations,
in co-operation with the government education departments. Membership of
youth groups is voluntary and groups vary greatly in their activities, there
being no attempt to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a
national youth movement.
Organised activities for young people were first promoted by voluntary bodies,
often of a religious nature, during the nineteenth century, and the number of
such organisations and the range of their activities have continued to grow
over the past 100 years. The involvement of local authorities and the education
departments in the youth service dates back principally to the 1940s when the
service first became recognised as part of the education system.

BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The education departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service
and encourage their achievement through financial assistance and advice. They
make known the Government’s attitude by means of circulars to local education
authorities and through contacts between departmental officials and representa¬
tives of the authorities and the voluntary organisations. Departments in Scot¬
land and Northern Ireland are advised on the finance and development of the
service by councils representing all those concerned in youth work. Financially
the education departments assist voluntary organisations through grants to¬
wards their costs for central administration and building projects.
Local education authorities assist local voluntary groups by lending premises
and equipment and by contributing to their capital and running costs. Many
authorities also construct and run youth centres and clubs; in Great Britain
there are several thousand youth centres fully run by local education authorities.
Most authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and
voluntary bodies are represented, and employ youth organisers to co-ordinate
youth work in their areas and to arrange in-service training.
Although the number of local education authority youth clubs and centres
is growing, national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of
youth activities through local groups, which raise most of their day-to-day
running expenses by their own efforts; these have an estimated membership
of 5-5 million. Some 50 national youth organisations and 39 local co-ordinating
bodies are full members of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services
(NCVYS), a consultative body which takes action only in the name and with
the consent of its member bodies; a further 15 organisations are observers. In
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there are similar representative bodies.
Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisations belonging to
NCVYS are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about 500,000 and
800,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs (400,000), the
National Association of Boys’ Clubs (170,000) and the Youth Hostels Associa¬
tions (290,000, including Scotland and Northern Ireland).
Certain pre-Service organisations for boys, which provide facilities for
social, educational and physical development along with training for possible
entry to the armed forces, are also members of NCVYS; they are assisted
financially by the Ministry of Defence.
Local education authority youth groups in England and Wales normally cater
for young people of both sexes mainly in the 14-20 age-range.
Some voluntary organisations cater for young people on a single-sex basis
and their membership often covers a wider age-range. An official survey
published in 1972 on the Youth Service and similar provision (see Bibliography
p. 469) showed that some two-thirds of young people aged 14-20 were members
of a club or association (including associations attached to schools, colleges and
universities, and places of work). The survey also indicated that 68 per cent or
more had at sometime been members of a youth club. A smaller proportion of
girls than boys take part in youth club activities and the main involvement is
between the ages of 14 and 16.
There are over 2,800 full-time youth workers in Great Britain and these are
supported by many thousands of part-time workers, many of them unpaid.
Part-time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work
but some have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large
number attend short courses and conferences on youth work. Qualified school
teachers are recognised as qualified youth workers.

EDUCATION I^5
In England and Wales, there is a basic two-year training for youth and
community workers. Provided at colleges of education and further education,
the course leads to a professional qualification. In addition a number of colleges
of education provide a study of youth work as a principal or subsidiary subject
within a teacher-training course. In Scotland one- and three-year courses are
provided at certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland the Ulster
Polytechnic provides a full-time course.
There are in Britain a number of organisations, which, although primarily
concerned with the welfare and out-of-school pursuits of young people, operate
in a context broader than that of any individual youth movement. Among the
most important are the Sports Councils for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland (see p. 448), which provide practical and advisory services
for many youth organisations; the National Playing Fields Association, which
advises local authorities and sports organisations on the acquisition, layout,
construction and use of sports grounds; and the Outward Bound Trust, which
maintains six sea and mountain schools in Britain offering full-time residential
courses designed to encourage a sense of adventure, responsibility, confidence
and achievement.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies
such as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is
designed as a challenge to young people to reach certain standards in leisure¬
time activities with the voluntary assistance of adults. Some 200,000 young
people between the ages of 14 and 25 from Britain and other Commonwealth
countries took part in the scheme in 1973. There are three awards—Bronze,
Silver and Gold—for each of which young people must attempt activities in
four out of five sections: service; interests; expeditions; and either physical
activity or design for living.
The King George’s Jubilee Trust is a charitable body which, since its
creation in 1935, has distributed more than £2-6 million in grants to voluntary
youth organisations and towards experimental youth projects.
The National Youth Bureau is a forum for association, discussion and joint
action for those concerned with the social education of young people. It
provides information services, training services and services to research and
experiment including the maintenance of a research register. The bureau also
has a specialist information unit on social work with young people.
There has been considerable growth in voluntary service by young people to
those in need in the community, for example, the elderly, the sick, the mentally
ill and the handicapped. Organisations such as International Voluntary Service,
Task Force and Community Service Volunteers receive grants from the
Government, and through them thousands of young people are doing full¬
er part-time voluntary work for the community. Many schools organise com¬
munity service activities as part of the curriculum.
The Young Volunteer Force Foundation is an independent body which
advises interested organisations in England and Wales on methods of involving
young people in providing service to the community. The Foundation is grant-
aided by the Government and employs teams of young people who are available
on request to assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations and
hospital boards in encouraging and promoting voluntary service. In Scotland,
a similar organisation, ‘Enterprise Youth’, exists to co-ordinate and promote
voluntary service to the community.
Environmental
Planning
Over many years successive British Governments have taken action to manage
and protect the environment, and have established a legal and administrative
framework, particularly of planning law, to control development, to reduce
pollution and to emphasise positive planning to ensure the wise use of land.
The basis of the modern system of land use planning—derived from legis¬
lation passed in 1947—is contained in the Town and Country Planning Acts of
1971 (for England and Wales) and 1972 (for Scotland). There is a centralised
planning structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scot¬
land and Wales, and compulsory planning duties are imposed on all local
planning authorities. Large scale strategic planning in England and Wales is
the responsibility of the county councils and the Greater London Council
while district councils and the councils of the London boroughs and the City of
London are responsible for most local plans and development control, the main
housing functions, and many other environmental health matters. The two
types of authority exercise concurrent powers over, for example, the acquisition
and disposal of land for planning purposes, development and redevelopment,
parks, playing fields, open spaces and coast protection. In Scotland, planning
functions are undertaken by the councils of counties and large burghs but from
May 1975 (see p. 65) there will be a division of responsibilities between
regional and district authorities broadly similar to that in England and Wales.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Housing, Local Government and
Planning is responsible for planning matters through its local offices which
work closely with the district councils and the local offices of the Housing
Executive (see p. 178). District councils have local environmental health
responsibilities.
A development control system of structure and local plans was introduced in
England and Wales in the late 1960s and is being progressively brought into
operation. The system is designed to reduce administrative delays, to empha¬
sise positive planning for the creation of a pleasant environment rather than a
negative control of undesirable development, and to enable the public to play
a greater part in the planning process. Structure plans are prepared by county
planning authorities and require ministerial approval. They set out broad
policies for the future use and development of land (including traffic manage¬
ment) and show ‘action areas’ where comprehensive development or improve¬
ment is expected to start within a specified period. Local plans, which have to
conform with the structure plan, contain detailed proposals including plans
for ‘action areas’ and are normally prepared by district councils, though some¬
times by county councils. Local plans are adopted by the planning authorities
without being subject to ministerial approval unless the Secretary of State
calls in a plan for his own decision. All plans are under continuous review and
may be altered periodically. A similar planning system will be introduced in
Scotland in May 1975.

The local authorities have wide powers for undertaking development, in¬
cluding the compulsory purchase of land. With a few exceptions, all other
development (which includes most forms of construction, mineral extraction
and any material change made in the use of land or existing buildings) can be
carried out only after the local planning authority has given its permission.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative
stages of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must
ensure adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans;
representations may be made about them to the authorities. Where specific
proposals for development differ substantially from the intentions of a develop¬
ment plan, they must be publicised locally. Other schemes affecting a large
number of people are usually advertised by the local planning authority and
applications seeking permission for certain types of development must also
be advertised. There is a right of appeal to the appropriate Secretary of State
if planning permission is refused or granted subject to conditions; in England
and Wales some 75 per cent of appeals are transferred to inspectors for decision.
An appellant always has the right to put his case before an inspector appointed
by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
him for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and only in respect of
proposals of national or regional importance. The applicant has the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a public inquiry
is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development schemes of
national or regional importance or of a technical or scientific nature and if an
ordinary inquiry is inadequate for the purpose, the ministers responsible may
decide to set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out investigations and
hold inquiries locally. Where highway development is proposed, the Secre¬
taries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales can hold such
inquiries as they consider appropriate.
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for England, Wales and Nor¬
thern Ireland, founded in 1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain and
has over 425,000 members. For the benefit of the public it owns and protects
from harmful development 400,000 acres (160,000 hectares) of land, 200
historic buildings and large stretches of coastline. Properties in Scotland
covering some 82,000 acres (32,800 hectares) are protected by the National
Trust for Scotland, an independent body founded in 1931, which has over
64,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning in Britain, and helped to pro¬
mote, for example, the first new towns legislation. The Civic Trust, estab¬
lished in 1957, encourages interest in architecture and planning and makes
annual awards for good developments of all kinds. It supports and advises over
1,100 amenity societies and, at the request of the Government, is providing the
United Kingdom secretariat for European Architectural Heritage Year 1975.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Preservation of Rural
Scotland and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside; the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the Ramblers’

Association; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Georgian
Group and the Scottish Georgian Society; the Ulster Architectural Heritage
Society; the Victorian Society; the Pilgrim Trust; and the Historic Churches
Preservation Trust. The Committee for Environmental Conservation, com¬
prising many of the main voluntary organisations, acts as a liaison body and is
concerned with broader questions of amenity than those covered by individual
societies. In Wales, the Prince of Wales Committee promotes projects to
improve the environment and encourages a greater awareness of environmental
problems.
Advisory machinery for regional planning has been set up by the Government.
The structure plans of county councils are prepared within the framework of
the physical and economic planning of each particular region.
This process is encouraged by the preparation of regional strategies drawn up
by regional economic planning councils (see p. 190), regional economic plan¬
ning boards and local planning authorities. Certain county councils combine
their preparatory work on structure plans and, in some cases, joint plans are
submitted for ministerial approval.
Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
measures, control the location of industry and offices (see p. 207). General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of
government departments, but each development scheme, as a rule, requires
the local planning authority’s consent. Financial incentives to encourage the
location of industry in particular areas have been made available by the
Government.
In Great Britain the New Towns Act 1946 and subsequent legislation (now
consolidated in Acts of 1965 and 1968) give the Secretaries of State for the
Environment, Scotland and Wales power to designate as the site of a new town
any area of land (which may include an existing centre of population). The
New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 makes similar provision for Northern
Ireland.
The appropriate minister must consult the local authorities concerned and
allow the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed designation. A
development corporation is appointed by the Government to create and plan
the growth of the town. It is responsible for the master plan, which is pre¬
pared in consultation with the appropriate minister, government departments,
and the local authorities in the area. Residents are given an opportunity to state
their views and, if necessary, a public inquiry is held. When the plan has been
agreed, the development corporation draws up detailed proposals for parti¬
cular areas and submits them to the responsible minister for approval which
(given after consultation with the local planning authorities) constitutes
planning permission. A development corporation has general powers to acquire
by agreement or compulsory purchase any land or property within the desig¬
nated area necessary for its purposes, and is empowered to provide houses,
offices, factories and other essential buildings, estate roads and, in certain
circumstances, the main services essential to the development of the town.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced from public funds
and is repayable over 60 years. Under the New Towns Act 1946 Parliament
approved a fund of £50 million to provide for advances to the development
corporations for work on the new towns. This fund was increased by subse¬
quent Acts and now stands at ^1,500 million; a total of over £1,100 million

had been advanced by March 1974. The corporations submit annual reports
(which include copies of their audited accounts) to Parliament.
Of the 33 new towns designated in Britain since 1946, 23 are in England and
Wales, six in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland. Eleven of the new towns
in England and Wales (Basildon, Bracknell, Crawley, Harlow, Hatfield,
Kernel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Peterborough, Stevenage
and Welwyn) are designed to help to relieve housing problems in the Greater
London area. Of the others, Aycliffe, Corby, Cwmbran, Peterlee and Wash¬
ington are serving the special needs of their areas; Newtown is being developed
to stem rural depopulation in mid-Wales and create conditions for growth in
the area; Runcorn and Skelmersdale are helping to meet the overspill needs of
Liverpool and north Merseyside; Telford and Redditch are taking population
from Birmingham and the West Midlands conurbation; and Warrington aims
to attract people from the Liverpool and Manchester areas. The central Lan¬
cashire new town has been designated to ease further the housing problems of
Liverpool and Manchester and to provide a growth point for the region’s
economy.
The six Scottish new towns (Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Glenrothes,
Irvine, Livingston and Stonehouse) are helping to house people from Glasgow
and are major growth areas in the central belt of Scotland; the Stonehouse new
town is to be managed by the development corporation of East Kilbride new
town. In Northern Ireland, Craigavon is being developed as a new city and is
rapidly becoming an area of major industrial growth; Antrim and Ballymena
are also becoming centres of economic growth; and Londonderry and the
surrounding district have been designated as an area of special development.
Four new towns (Crawley, Hatfield, Kernel Hempstead and Welwyn) have
been substantially completed and are now the responsibility of the Com¬
mission for the New Towns, a government-appointed agency.
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use. They
are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experiments,
both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.
The population of the new towns in Great Britain is about i-8 million;
more than 800,000 people have moved into them during the past 25 years.
Young people form a higher proportion of new town populations than of the
country as a whole. An extensive building and civil engineering programme
has provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, churches, health centres
and libraries as well as public buildings including town halls and law courts.
Roads, water supplies, sewerage, gas and electricity, police, fire and bus
stations, postal, telegraph and telephone facilities have also been provided;
most of the towns are well-equipped with parks and playing fields of various
kinds. All the new towns have become concerned with the increasingly high
level of car ownership of their inhabitants and are making more adequate
provision for parking and the segregation of pedestrians from motorists; a few
are creating special facilities for different modes of transport, for example,
roads for bicycles or buses only.
A number of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres and,
as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support, offices,
hotels and department stores, as well as arts centres and full entertainment and
recreational facilities (skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming
pools, sports stadia, golf courses and youth centres) are gradually being pro¬
vided. The expansion of large existing towns such as Northampton, Peter¬
borough and Warrington has the advantage, among others, that many of these
facilities are already available.

The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of congestion
in large industrial towns in England and Wales (such as London and Birming¬
ham) by encouraging the transfer of population to areas suitable for expansion.
Schemes have been approved, providing some 164,000 dwellings in this way,
of which about half have been built. Most of the expanding towns (for example,
Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and Thetford) are well established and are
providing homes and jobs for people from large cities. The Housing and Town
Development (Scotland) Act 1957 makes similar provision for Scotland, where
the only congested town so far involved is Glasgow.
Urban

Historic
Buildings
and
Monuments
Existing towns and cities are being renewed and re-shaped to improve the
environment and to meet the growth in population and traffic. Local authori¬
ties have extensive powers (often aided by government grants) to clear slum
dwellings, to improve individual houses or whole residential areas, to reclaim
derelict land, to secure clean air and to manage traffic. The Government
believes that greater integration of land use and transport planning is of basic
importance, and through the Department of the Environment (see p. 48)
ensures that a total strategic approach to environmental planning and protec¬
tion is adopted. Studies of six urban areas in England have been undertaken by
the Department of the Environment and local authorities to emphasise this
type of approach to urban problems. Three of the studies are concerned with
the problems of industrial towns and the other three studies with those of
‘inner city’ areas.
Research into urban planning problems is also undertaken by a number of
institutes and university departments and by the Centre for Environmental
Studies, which is financed jointly by the Government and other sources, in¬
cluding the Ford Foundation. The School of Advanced Urban Studies at
Bristol University provides some 80 places for people concerned with all
aspects of urban planning.
Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; 209,060 buildings are
already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any listed
building without special consent from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a building,
the Royal Commissions on Historical Monuments have an opportunity to
make a photographic record of the building. Emergency ‘building preservation
notices’ can be served by the local planning authority to protect buildings not
yet listed. The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of the
appropriate Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the
repair or maintenance of buildings (or groups of buildings) of outstanding
interest, and local authorities can make grants and loans for any building of
architectural or historic interest even if it is not listed. Over 2,000 buildings
in Great Britain have received grants and loans totalling nearly £10 million
under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953. Local plan¬
ning authorities have designated for special protection over 3,000 ‘conser¬
vation areas’ of particular architectural or historic interest. Studies have
been made in Bath, Chester, Chichester and York of the difficulties of preserv¬
ing features of historic interest in ancient towns in the face of commercial
development and increasing motor traffic. The Secretaries of State for the
Environment, Scotland and Wales are responsible for the maintenance of
royal parks and palaces and for the protection of ancient monuments of which

over 780 are in their care. Over 16 million people visited them in 1973. The
Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (for England), and similar
bodies for Scotland and Wales, survey monuments and specify those worthy
of preservation. In Northern Ireland 137 historic monuments are maintained
and protected by the state and there is planning legislation on the listing of
buildings of special architectural or historic interest.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from building
development and where townspeople can seek recreation) have been estab¬
lished around all or part of certain urban areas and cover over 2,000 square
miles (5,180 sq. km.) in England. About three-quarters of London’s green
belt is agricultural land or woodland, some of which can be used for recrea¬
tion. There are also country parks, public open spaces, playing fields and
golf courses specifically for recreational use. In Scotland there are green belt
areas around the main cities.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast, for example, providing recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast’s natural attractions and preserve coastal areas of
scientific interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales was under¬
taken by the Countryside Commission in 1966-70 which recommended that
certain stretches of underdeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. Policies for these areas are being incorporated in the
planning authorities’ structure and local plans.
In 1965 the National Trust launched its Enterprise Neptune campaign to
raise funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great natural
beauty and recreational value. Some £2 million was raised and, as a result,
the National Trust has brought under its protection a further 159 miles
(255-9 km.) of coastline making a total of 346 miles (556-8 km.) in its care in
March 1974. The campaign has been extended with the aim of acquiring an¬
other 100 miles of coastline.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the Department
of the Environment and the Welsh Office are centrally responsible in England
and Wales, presents difficult engineering problems and heavy costs for the
maritime local authorities. All sizeable coast protection schemes drawn up by
the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949 are investigated by
government engineering staff. Substantial grants from central funds (up to a
maximum of 80 per cent) are made to authorities with small resources. Pro¬
tection against sea flooding where there is no question of erosion is the respon¬
sibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (see p. 291). To help
to prevent the pollution of the coastline, international regulations restrict the
discharge of oil into the sea (see p. 307). Local authorities are equipped to deal
with oil discharges which reach the shore and in-shore waters.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) encourage the provision and development of facilities for open-air
recreation in the countryside. These include the provision by local authorities
(sometimes in association with other bodies) and private individuals of country
parks within easy reach of towns; the establishment of camping sites and picnic
ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING

areas; and the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for
bathing, sailing and other activities. By August 1974, 99 country parks and
113 picnic sites had been recognised in England and Wales by the Countryside
Commission. In Scotland a large number of local authority schemes for the
provision of a variety of countryside facilities have been approved for grant
aid. The Countryside Commission for Scotland has approved four country
parks. The commissions are also responsible for encouraging and promoting
measures to conserve and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the
countryside and may undertake research projects and experimental schemes,
working in consultation with local authorities and such bodies as the Nature
Conservancy Council (see p. 174) and the Sports Council (see p. 448). In
England and Wales, the Countryside Commission may give financial assistance
to public bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recreation and
amenity projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) replaced and assumed
the functions of the National Parks Commission set up under the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to select national parks and
‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and to make proposals for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover 5,258 square miles (13,618 sq. km.),
or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is based on
local authority representation, with a third of the members appointed by the
Government. By August 1974, 32 areas of outstanding natural beauty had been
designated, covering some 5,588 square miles (14,473 S<1- km.).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which government grants are available, such as tree planting and preserva¬
tion, and the removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the
benefit of the public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan
areas, and information centres. All national parks and some other designated
areas have warden services. Most local authority expenditure on national
parks is met by central government grants. Some 1,500 miles (2,414 km.) of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways had been approved by August 1974.
Large stretches of these paths are already public rights of way. A number of
the routes are open and further routes are being established.
Under the Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 the Ulster Country¬
side Committee advises on the establishment of national parks and the
designation of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Eight areas have been
designated. Five amenity areas, acquired by the Department of Housing,
Local Government and Planning, are being managed as country parks.
Although there are no national parks as such in Scotland, five large national
park direction areas are subject to special planning control under ministerial
supervision. The areas are: Loch Lomond-Trossachs; Glen Affric-Glen
Cannich-Strath Farrar; Ben Nevis-Glen Coe-Black Mount; the Cairngorms;
and Loch Torridon-Loch Maree-Little Loch Broom. Over 98 per cent of the
land in Scotland has been designated as countryside within the jurisdiction of
the Countryside Commission for Scotland.

The Forestry Commission (see p. 300) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen
Trool, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
England and Scotland. The parks cover some 600,000 acres (243,000 hectares).
Camping and other recreational facilities provided in all the parks are used by
several million holidaymakers each year. The historic New Forest, in Hamp¬
shire, although not a forest park, is also open to the public. In addition the
Forestry Commission welcomes the public to many parts of the 3 million acres
under its management. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture
has established five forest parks—Tollymore Park, Castlewellan, Gortin Glen,
Drum Manor and Gosford Castle—and there are also five forest scenic drives;
in some 40 forests recreational facilities have been provided.
Under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 county
councils in most areas of England and Wales have prepared maps showing all
public rights of way, which must be kept free of vehicles and obstructions and
must not be permanently disturbed. If a path is not shown on the map, a
private citizen can show that it is a public right of way if it has been used and
regarded as such without interruption for at least 20 years. Public footpaths are
maintained by local highway authorities who must also provide signposts and
supervise the duty of landowners to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in
Great Britain can create paths and ways, close existing paths which are no
longer in public use, and divert paths to secure a more efficient use of the land
or simply a shorter route. Local planning authorities can convert minor roads
into footpaths or bridleways and provide recreational facilities.
The 1949 Act is also concerned with access to open country, which now
includes mountains, moors, heaths, downs, cliffs and foreshores, woodlands,
rivers and canals and their banks, but not farmland unless it is simply used for
grazing. There is no automatic right of public access to open country, but
local planning authorities can secure access by means of agreements with land-
owners; if agreements cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or
make orders for public access. These powers were extended in 1967 to cover
Scotland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 1 -5 million acres (600,000 hectares) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland). This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or
over it, for example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by
law and cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act
1965 provided for the registration of all commons and village greens, and by
the close of the registration period in 1970 over 16,000 areas had been regis¬
tered. Under the Countryside Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities
for enjoyment on any common land to which the public has access.
The Nature Conservancy Council (see p. 396) is the official body responsible
for nature conservation in Great Britain. At the end of March 1974 there were
137 national nature reserves, covering 281,375 acres (113,867 hectares). Some
37 nature reserves are run by local authorities; in woodland areas there are
nine forest nature reserves; in addition a number of reserves have been estab¬
lished by voluntary bodies. There are also 3,165 sites of special scientific

interest in Great Britain, designated because of their flora, fauna or geological
or physiological features: local planning authorities must consult the Nature
Conservancy Council before granting planning permission for development
affecting them. In Northern Ireland 35 sites have been scheduled by the
Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning and are subject to
special planning control. Some 15 nature reserves have been established by the
department on the advice of the Nature Reserves Committee.
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations co-operate in the conservation
of nature (and in many cases establish their own reserves or other specially
protected areas); these include: the National Trust, the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds, the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the
County Naturalists Trusts and the Council for Nature (which consists of some
350 natural history and conservation societies).
While specific measures have been adopted to ensure that the use of land in
towns and in the countryside is properly supervised, a growing concern for the
wider aspects of planning has meant that the restricted notion of protective
planning has evolved into a positive concept for the enhancement of the land
and of the enjoyment of the people who live and work on it.
In 1970 Britain became the first major country to establish a Department of
the Environment (see p. 48); all government departments in Great Britain
have a legal duty when exercising functions relating to land to keep in mind
the desirability of conserving the countryside’s natural beauty and amenity.
Many of the detailed aspects of planning for the environment are under¬
taken by local authorities. The local planning authorities have power to
preserve trees and woodlands in the interest of amenity by means of tree
preservation orders; when granting planning permission for development, a
local planning authority must impose conditions to secure the preservation or
planting of trees; and landowners are generally required to replace ‘preserved’
trees which die or are removed or destroyed. Outdoor display of advertise¬
ments is controlled by planning legislation; consent must be sought from the
local planning authority for most forms of outdoor advertising, and in rural and
other localities requiring special protection on grounds of amenity special
controls may be applied. In addition to the general town and country planning
controls over development, land may not generally be used as a caravan site
unless a site licence has been issued by the local authority. The Litter Act 1958
made it an offence to leave litter on land to which the public has free access;
under the Civic Amenities Act 1967 local authorities are empowered to
remove abandoned cars and other bulky rubbish. The Dangerous Litter Act
1971 improved provision for the prevention of dangerous litter.
Local authorities are responsible for reclaiming land so damaged by in¬
dustrial or other development that it is not capable of being used fully without
special treatment. Local planning authorities have powers for reclaiming land
in pursuit of the general well-being of their districts—for example, in the
course of providing open spaces and schools; they can acquire and develop
land and carry out restoration and improvement; and they can require an
owner of land which is damaging and offensive to the surrounding area to
improve its condition. Exchequer grants cover half the cost of local authority
clearance schemes, and higher grants are available for clearance in the less
prosperous areas and in the national parks and areas of outstanding natural
beauty. Planning controls to prevent the spread of dereliction require that,
when permission is granted for mineral working, conditions are attached

ensuring various measures to minimise the disturbance caused by the work
and to secure whatever restoration is practicable when working ceases. The
use of land for tipping is also subject to conditions restricting height or
requiring treatment on completion. Specialist derelict land units within the
Department of the Environment, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office
provide central information and advice and make a continuous assessment of
land reclamation problems.
The Deposit of Poisonous Waste Act 1972 introduced stringent controls to
prevent the dumping of poisonous waste. These were intended to be of an
interim nature only and the Government has published proposals designed to
provide planning and management control over all waste disposal. Where
possible recycling and reclamation is encouraged by the Government.
Responsibility for clean air in towns and cities rests with local authorities,
who may declare ‘smoke control areas’ within which the emission of smoke
from chimneys constitutes an offence: some 4,000 smoke control orders had
been confirmed by April 1974 and 6*2 million dwellings and commercial
premises are subject to smoke control. Central government is responsible
through the Clean Air and Alkali Inspectorate for enforcing control of emissions
to the air of noxious and offensive substances including smoke, grit and dust
from certain industrial processes. The emission of smoke from motor vehicles
is also controlled. The Clean Air Council (set up in 1956) and a similar council
for Scotland review the progress made in abating air pollution in Great Britain.
Partly as a result of air pollution control, London no longer experiences dense
(‘pea-souper’) fogs or serious smogs and in central London winter sunshine has
increased by 70 per cent since 1962.
Local authorities are also responsible for the enforcement of the Noise
Abatement Act i960 which requires them to inspect their areas for noise
nuisances and to take action (which can be enforced by the courts) to secure
abatement. Some 13,300 complaints about noise nuisance were received by
local authorities in 1972, and in 44 per cent of these cases the authorities con¬
sidered that nuisance existed and took appropriate action. The Advisory
Council on Noise has studied the working of the Act and recommended some
improvements which are being considered for legislation.
Other special measures have been introduced to help to combat water pol¬
lution (see p. 277), to reduce the level of fumes from motor vehicles and to
ensure that the use of agricultural chemicals is properly supervised (see p. 294).
In order to frame a policy for pollution control there is a process of continuous
updating of information on environmental hazards. The Government is
advised by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (see p. 398).
9 Housing
There are about 19*8 million dwellings in Britain: over 17-5 million in
England and Wales, i-8 million in Scotland and 475,000 in Northern Ireland.
Nationally the numbers of households and dwellings are about equal, but they
are unevenly distributed, and housing shortages persist in the more prosperous
commercial and industrial centres such as London and Birmingham.
The large majority of people in Great Britain—85 per cent in the 1966
sample census—live in houses or bungalows, mostly with gardens; the remain¬
der live in flats or maisonettes, normally in blocks of from two to 20 storeys.
Over half of all dwellings are owned by their occupiers, some 30 per cent
are rented from public housing authorities, and most of the remainder are
rented from private landlords (see diagram, p. 178). There are variations,
however, in the distribution of tenure between the different countries of
Britain—in Scotland more than half the dwellings are rented from public
authorities—and in different regions and areas of those countries. Private
rented accommodation is generally more common in the central districts of
large towns, while owner-occupation is more frequent in their outer suburbs
and in country areas.
New house construction in Britain is undertaken by both public and private
sectors. Of the 304,000 dwellings completed in 1973 some 63 per cent was
provided by private interests, over 34 per cent by public authorities, and
nearly 3 per cent by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public
housing authorities provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests
build mainly for sale to owner-occupiers. The construction of private dwellings
to rent has dwindled to a very low level.
Over 8-4 million new dwellings have been built in Britain since 1945, and
two families in every five now live in a post-war dwelling (see diagram, p. 178).
There remain a large number of older dwellings, some of which have been
kept in good repair and modernised, while many others—particularly in the
centres of cities—are unsatisfactory by modern standards. The demolition of
slum dwellings and more advanced standards for new house-building (particu¬
larly in the public sector) have, however, led to significant improvements in
the general quality of British housing. A survey carried out in 1971 established
that the percentage of unfit dwellings fell from 117 per cent in 1967 to 7-3
per cent in 1971.
Administration Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Secretary of State for the Environment in England,
by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, and in Northern Ireland
by the head of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning.
In Great Britain most of the public housing is provided by 638 local
housing authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of
housing in their areas is adequate. These are: in England and Wales (outside
London) the district councils; in London, the Greater London Council, the
London borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London;
and in Scotland, the town and county councils. After the reorganisation of
local government in Scotland in May 1975 (see p. 65) the new district councils

will be the housing authorities. Other public housing authorities in Great
Britain are the new town authorities (see p. 168) and the Scottish Special
Housing Association (SSHA), which was established in 1937 to supplement
building by local authorities in Scotland.
The central government departments specify certain standards for the con¬
struction and equipment of all new dwellings; these are enforced by the local
authorities. Subsidies are made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout.
Besides providing public housing, local authorities are involved in many
other aspects of housing policy, including paying house improvement grants to
the private sector, granting mortgages to owner-occupiers, and carrying out
slum-clearance and redevelopment programmes. A growing number are
establishing housing advisory centres to provide the public with information
on local housing opportunities in both public and private sectors.
In Northern Ireland all public housing, including that in new towns, is
the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, a public body
established in 1971. The executive is aided by a housing council representing
each local authority area.
The main objectives of government housing policy are to secure a decent home
for every family at a price within its means, and to ensure fairness between
one citizen and another in giving and receiving help towards housing costs.
Local authorities are encouraged to provide housing to meet local needs.
Government subsidies are available for local authorities which incur financial
deficits in clearing slums and providing adequate public sector housing in
areas of housing shortage. The Government is concerned to ensure that best
use is made of the existing housing stock.
A national system of rent rebate and allowance schemes assists poorer
tenants in both the public and private sectors. Operated by local authorities,
the schemes are financed mainly by central government where their cost results
in a deficit for the authorities.
Research and Research into building materials and techniques, as well as into the needs of
Development families, is undertaken by the Directorate-General of Research within the

Public Sector
Housing
Finance
Department of the Environment, the Research and Development Group of
the Scottish Development Department, the Building Research Establishment,
the architects’ departments of major local authorities and the research groups
in big constructional firms. The Government is advised on the need for, and
application of, research and development by the Construction and Housing
Research Advisory Council. Advice on ways of increasing productivity in
house-building is also provided by the National Building Agency.
Public housing authorities in Britain own some 6 million houses and flats
and in 1973 completed over 104,000 new dwellings. The number of houses
owned by each authority varies widely, some having a stock of well over 100,000
houses. Authorities plan their own building programmes within the framework
of government policy. In 1974 the Government authorised additional public
expenditure on housing to enable local authorities to increase their building
programme for rent and to acquire unsold or completed houses in the private
sector; a start is also to be made on programmes for municipal ownership of
privately rented housing in the worst areas of housing stress.
Local authorities in Great Britain meet the capital costs of new house con¬
struction by raising loans on the open market or by borrowing from the Public
Works Loan Board (see p. 72). Current expenditure, including maintenance
costs and loan interest and repayments, is met from rents, supplemented
where necessary by subsidies from the Exchequer and sometimes (particularly
in Scotland) from the rates. Subsidies for public housing in 1973-74 totalled
some £363 million in England and Wales and about .£66 million in Scotland.
Under the Housing Finance Act 1972 and Housing (Financial Provisions)
(Scotland) Act 1972, government subsidies concentrate financial assistance
on those authorities and tenants in greatest need. All local authorities in
England and Wales are required to base their rents upon the ‘fair rent’ principle
which already applies to much rented accommodation in the private sector,
while those in Scotland must ensure that rents go up by stages to such a level
that (taking new subsidies into account) they can balance their housing
expenditure without any deficit falling on the rates. In England and Wales the
level of council house rents is intended to enable an increasing number of local
authorities—especially those with a high proportion of older council housing
—to meet their housing expenditure without further subsidies. Other authori¬
ties—those with substantial building programmes and a large proportion of
newer council housing—are assisted by subsidies designed to help them balance
expenditure. Subsidies assist those authorities in Scotland which have rising
expenditure resulting from a heavy building programme. Following the change
in Government in March 1974 the provisions of the two Acts are being
reviewed.
Supplementary subsidies have been made available under the Acts to assist
local authorities throughout Great Britain with slum clearance. In addition,
there is a national system of rent rebates and allowances covering all tenants,
and financed largely by government subsidy where they cause a deficit in
housing revenue accounts. The scheme assists poorer tenants in meeting rents
of accommodation suited to their needs.
In Northern Ireland, the capital expenditure of the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive is financed by loans raised on the open market or borrowed
from the National Loans Fund. New dwellings completed by the executive
qualify for government subsidy at a rate which varies according to the number
of persons for whom each dwelling is designed.

Construction
and Design
BRITAIN 1975: an OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In selecting tenants for new or vacant dwellings, local authorities normally
give preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions,
but they are free to allocate houses according to their own schemes. Authorities
normally establish waiting lists and treat applicants (outside priority categories)
in order of application; some require applicants to fulfil residence requirements
before they are accepted on waiting lists.
Although a number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses, most
building is undertaken by private firms under contract. Some authorities work
in consortia to make the best use of industrialised systems in their house¬
building programmes.
Dwellings are constructed to meet the needs of different sizes of household.
More than a quarter are of the single bedroom type suitable for smaller house¬
holds including the elderly, but the majority are designed for families and
have two or three bedrooms, two living rooms and a kitchen, bathroom and
lavatory. The standard of new local authority housing has improved, particu¬
larly in the floor space provided and the heating systems installed. In England
and Wales in 1972 some 92 per cent of new dwellings had central heating, and
houses built for families of four or five people had an average floor space of 959
square feet (89 square metres) and cost an average of about £4,575 to build.

Assistance
In 1973 over 190,000 private sector dwellings were completed in Britain,
almost all of which were intended for owner-occupation. The number of
people owning their own houses has more than doubled in the last 20 years,
and the 10 million owner-occupied dwellings in Britain now account for over
half of the total housing stock. Although most owner-occupied houses were
built for that purpose, many private rented dwellings have also been sold for
owner-occupation. The Government also encourages voluntary housing
societies which provide co-ownership housing.
Loans to enable people to buy their own houses by a system of instalment
purchase are available from various sources, including building societies,
insurance companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies (see also p. 372) are the most important of these agencies.
They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term loans on the
security of property bought for owner-occupation. They usually advance up to
80 per cent of their valuation of a house but it is possible to borrow up to 95 per
cent, or in rare cases, 100 per cent. Loans are normally repayable over periods
of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in exceptional circumstances) by equal
monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. The average price of new
houses mortgaged to building societies in 1973 was £10,617; houses in London
and the south-east of England cost some 40 per cent more than the national
average. In 1973 the societies advanced some £3,447 million.
Local authorities are encouraged to concentrate their mortgage resources on
helping people with housing needs who are unable to obtain loans elsewhere.
Their mortgage lending in 1973 amounted to £293 million.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest payments,
and in 1973-74 this amounted to about £500 million. An alternative form of
assistance—the option mortgage scheme—designed to help those with smaller
incomes was introduced in 1968. Under the scheme, borrowers receive, through
the lending agency, a subsidy (instead of tax relief) which reduces the rate of
mortgage interest which they pay by up to 3^ per cent. Subsidy payments under
the option mortgage scheme in Great Britain amounted in 1973-74 to about

£51 million. Associated with the scheme is the option mortgage guarantee
scheme, whereby mortgage loans of up to 100 per cent of the valuation of a
house (not exceeding £7,500) may be made to those participating.
In Northern Ireland, the Government pays subsidies to private people who
build dwellings for owner-occupation or letting.
For building in the private sector the National House Building Council
(NHBC) sets standards and enforces them by inspection and certification.
Almost all new private houses are covered by the council’s scheme which
carries a ten-year guarantee against major structural defects. A two-year
guarantee is also given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not
grant mortgages on a new house unless it is covered by a NHBC certificate.
During the last 20 years there has been a steady decline in Great Britain in the
number of rented dwellings available from private landlords—from nearly 45
per cent of the housing stock in 1951 to about 17 per cent (3-3 million) in
1973. Major factors in this decline have been the increased demand for owner-
occupation, the greater availability of public rented housing, and the operation
of rent restriction. Privately rented dwellings form a high proportion of
Britain’s older housing and many have been demolished under slum clearance
programmes. While most landlords in Britain are private individuals with
limited holdings, a proportion of all privately rented housing is provided by
the small number of larger property owners, including property companies.
Most privately rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction under legisla¬
tion which provides separate machinery for dealing with unfurnished and
furnished accommodation. Tenants have a wide degree of security of tenure,
and eviction from any dwelling (without a court order) and harassment of
occupiers are criminal offences with severe penalties.
About 80 per cent of all private rented accommodation in Great Britain
is let unfurnished. Most unfurnished accommodation is subject to either ‘rent
control’ or ‘rent regulation’. Rent control applies to about a third of the
unfurnished dwellings—those with a 1956 rateable value of £30 or less (£40
in London and Scotland). Tenants of controlled dwellings enjoy security of
tenure during their lifetime and pay fixed rents determined by reference to
1956 rateable values or, in Scotland, to historic rent levels. These are very low
by comparison with other rents. Landlords of controlled dwellings whose
houses are of a satisfactory standard or who improve them to such a standard
are able to transfer them to the alternative system of rent regulation. The
transfer of all remaining controlled tenancies into the rent regulation system
continues.
Rent regulation was introduced in 1965 and applies to private unfurnished
dwellings (but not while they remain controlled under previous legislation)
which fall within the Rent Act limits of rateable value. Under the Housing
Finance Act 1972, its principle was extended to cover rented dwellings (within
the rateable limits) owned by public housing authorities in England and Wales
and housing associations and societies.
Under the rent regulation procedure, a ‘fair rent’ may be fixed for a tenancy
by independent rent officers at the request of the landlord, the tenant, or both.
Factors taken into account by rent officers in determining rents include the
age, character and locality of the house. To eliminate any artificial value
derived from scarcity, the assumption is made that for similar dwellings to let
in the area demand does not exceed supply. If the landlord or tenant objects
to the decision of the rent officer, the case is referred to a rent assessment
182 BRITAIN 1975: an OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
committee. Since 1965 some 595,000 fair rents have been registered. Once
determined, the rent is not normally reviewed for at least three years. Tenants
of controlled and regulated lettings enjoy security of tenure.
The tenants of private unfurnished accommodation are eligible for assistance
with their rent under a national scheme of rent allowances. Operated by local
authorities, the scheme is financed mainly by government subsidies.
In Northern Ireland, houses of a 1939 rateable value of less than £50 are
subject to rent control with rents fixed by reference to their rateable value in
that year. However, prescribed increases were permitted in the rents of certain
controlled dwellings in 1951 and 1956, and dwellings of which landlords are
in, or obtain, possession and dwellings completed since 1956 are freed from
rent control.
Under the Rent Act 1974, tenants of furnished accommodation whose land¬
lords do not live on the same premises now have the same protection as tenants
of unfurnished property, and may apply to a rent officer for a fair rent
determination. Tenants of furnished accommodation with resident landlords
may refer their tenancy agreements to a local rent tribunal for determination
of a reasonable rent. Tribunals may grant tenants security of tenure for up to
six months with a possibility of further periods if they so decide.
Poorer tenants in furnished accommodation are helped with their rent by
a rent allowance scheme.
Since the early 1960s the Government has encouraged the growth of non-
profit-making housing associations and societies, which between them own
some 240,000 dwellings in Great Britain; some 30,000 were completed or
acquired in 1973.
Housing associations have long existed as voluntary bodies set up for the
purpose of providing low-rent housing for people in need. The associations
have in the past borrowed money to finance house-building, mainly from local
authorities, which may make up to 100 per cent loans. Encouragement to pur¬
chase and convert old houses into new dwellings was offered by the Housing
Act of 1969 which provides for a 20-year subsidy equivalent to half of all
charges (capital and interest) on loans raised for the purpose. Under the 1972
legislation housing associations, like co-ownership societies (see below), are
able to borrow from the Housing Corporation for new building. The rents
of housing association houses are based on fair-rent levels, and their tenants
are entitled to rent allowances (see p. 178). On new schemes where fair rents
produce insufficient revenue to cover the capital cost of a scheme, associa¬
tions receive a government subsidy covering the deficit.
Co-ownership societies build dwellings for co-ownership by a group of
occupants to let at unsubsidised rents. Following a pilot scheme introduced
by the Housing Act 1961, the Housing Corporation was set up under the
Housing Act 1964 to stimulate the formation of such societies. Half of the
money needed for approved co-ownership society schemes is advanced by
building societies, with the Housing Corporation providing the remainder.
Rented housing society dwellings like those owned by housing associations
are within the fair-rent and rent-allowance schemes.
Private owners in Great Britain can obtain grants from local authorities to
improve their houses by providing amenities such as baths and for carrying
out other works to modernise their properties. Grants are also available for
converting large houses or other buildings into flats. The grant normally

amounts to half the approved cost of the works up to a grant limit of £1,000
(£1,200 in Scotland). If a house of three or more storeys is converted into
flats the upper limit of grant is £1,200 for each flat provided. A grant of up to
£200 is also available for the provision for the first time of basic amenities
which a dwelling may lack. A government contribution amounting to three-
quarters of each grant is paid to the local authority. Aid on a similar basis is
given by the Government to local authorities and housing associations, but
this can include part of the cost of buying properties for conversion and
improvement as well as that of carrying out works.
Since improvement grants were first introduced in 1949, some 2-8 million
dwellings in England and Wales and some 200,000 in Scotland have been
improved with their aid; in 1973 house improvement grants were approved
for 453,500 dwellings in Great Britain compared with over 368,000 in 1972.
Grants for house improvement and conversion are also provided in Northern
Ireland.
In order to tackle systematically the improvement of whole areas of older
housing, local authorities in England and Wales have been given powers to
declare ‘general improvement areas’. The aim in these areas is to encourage
householders to improve their dwellings with the aid of grants, while the local
authority uses its comprehensive powers to improve the environment. A
government contribution is available of half the local authority’s expenditure
on environmental improvements on costs of up to £200 a house. There are
similar grants in Scotland and Northern Ireland for the improvement of
residential areas. Under the 1974 Housing Act local authorities are empowered
to declare ‘housing action areas’ in places of housing stress. In action areas
authorities have powers to compel owners to improve their houses to a given
standard and preferential rates of improvement grant are payable. Compulsory
powers are also available to local authorities in general improvement areas.
Slum Clearance
About 3 million people have been rehoused in England and Wales since the
mid-1950s as a result of slum clearance programmes and during 1973 some
80,000 houses were demolished or closed in Great Britain as a result of slum
clearance and other action. Some housing authorities have eliminated all their
slums and others expect to achieve this within a few years, but in Inner London
and in certain of the older industrial towns, clearance will take longer. Local
authorities receive special financial assistance from the Government if they
incur a loss on slum clearance operations.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners
of land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit
houses, a sum based on the value of the cleared site; additional payments are,
however, made to most owner-occupiers of unfit houses to bring their com¬
pensation up to market value.
10 The Churches
The Church of
England
Every person living in Britain has the right of religious freedom and may mani¬
fest his faith in teaching, worship and observance without interference from
the community or the state. Churches and religious societies of all kinds may
own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and in
writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public
office.
In the services administered by the state, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and
are paid a salary by the state for this part of their work. Clergy of other de¬
nominations may also be appointed as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 147)
provided by churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in Britain, since no inquiries are made
about religious beliefs in population censuses1 or other official returns, and
each church adopts its own criteria in counting its members. The membership
figures given in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The Church of England’s status as the established church of the land derives
from the Reformation in the sixteenth century. The Church’s relationship with
the state2 is one of mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church
balanced by certain duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always
be a member of the Church, and promises on his or her accession to uphold it;
Church of England archbishops, bishops3 and deans are appointed by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; all clergy take an oath of
allegiance to the Crown; the Church must obtain Parliament’s consent to
change its forms of worship (which are contained in the Book of Common
Prayer of 1662), although it has temporary powers to use alternative forms
without the need for parliamentary approval; and the two archbishops (of
Canterbury and York), the bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and
21 other bishops (according to their seniority as diocesan bishops) have
permanent seats in the House of Lords (see p. 29). Clergy of the Church of
England (together with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are legally disqualified from sitting
in the House of Commons (see p. 30).
1 In Northern Ireland, recent full censuses have contained an optional question about
people’s religious professions.
2 A church commission set up to consider the relationship between the Church of
England and the state has recommended in a report, Church and State (see Biblio¬
graphy p. 470), that, while the establishment of the Church should be maintained, the
Church should be given final authority over its forms of worship and doctrine; altera¬
tions should be made in the present procedure for the appointment of bishops; ministers
of all churches should be permitted to stand for election to the House of Commons and,
if elected, to take their seats; and leading members of other churches should be invited
to sit alongside Church of England bishops in the House of Lords.
3 The Church of England has decided to review the procedure for the appointment of
bishops to determine whether it or the state should have responsibility for this function.

The Anglican
Communion
i85
The Church is organised into 43 dioceses, grouped into two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and York, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which there are some 14,260. The
Archbishop of Canterbury is styled Trimate of All England’, and the Arch¬
bishop of York is ‘Primate of England’. Of the population born and resident in
the two provinces (roughly 46 million), about 60 per cent are baptised into the
Church and some 20 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body of the Church, the General Synod, is invested
with both spiritual authority and legislative and administrative powers; and
bishops, clergy and lay members are involved in decisions affecting the
whole range of the Church’s concern. In the dioceses, diocesan and deanery
synods are linked both with the General Synod and parish organisations.
Certain important issues must be referred for the approval of the dioceses
before they are finally decided by the General Synod. Lay members of the
Church are associated with church government in the parishes through
parochial church councils on which are members appointed by baptised
members of the Church over the age of 17 who are on the church electoral roll
of their local parish.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
various aspects of the Church’s work—such as education, recruitment and
training for the ministry, and church work at home and overseas. It is con¬
cerned with the Church of England schools (attended by about 11 per cent
of the 8*7 million pupils in the publicly maintained schools of England and
Wales in 1973); a number of direct grant and independent schools; church
colleges of education in England and Wales; theological colleges; and establish¬
ments for the training of women in pastoral work.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central General Synod Fund which the Central Board of
Finance administers for the maintenance of central services, including capital
expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for training can¬
didates for ordination. (Although the state pays for or contributes towards
some services provided by the Church—see p. 184—it makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses as such.) The Church’s endowment income
(from its assets amounting to over £600 million in land and investments) is
mainly administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely respon¬
sible for the payment of clergy stipends and the provision of finance for
pensions. The total net income (£28-5 million in 1972-73) has greatly increased
in recent years—in broad terms this has meant a rise in the stipends of the
poorer clergy and the introduction of schemes for better parsonage houses, for
church buildings in new areas of population, and for better pensions for clergy¬
men and their widows.
The Anglican Communion comprises 22 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of over
65 million. In the British Isles, in addition to the established Church of
England, there are other, unestablished, Anglican churches: the Church in
Wales, the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years (most recently in 1968) the Lambeth Conference meets for
unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops; presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys great

prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well
as bishops which meets every two years—is designed to provide consultations
within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of common
action.
The Church of Scotland, established by law, has a presbyterian form of
government. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which
is established and yet is free’. It derives its status from the Treaty of Union
1707 and the Church of Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. The Church appoints its own officers and its
decisions on questions of doctrine and discipline are not subject to parliamen¬
tary discussion or modification.
All ministers of the Church of Scotland are of equal status, each of some
2,000 churches being governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the
minister and the elected elders of the church; above the Kirk Session is the
Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, consisting of elected ministers and elders, which meets annually
under the presidency of an elected moderator who serves for one year. The
Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Com¬
missioner.
The training for the ministry (to which women may be admitted) has given
the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The adult communicant membership of the
Church of Scotland is estimated at about i-i million.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the ‘nonconformist’
churches of England (which dissent from certain practices of the established
church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions regarding organi¬
sation and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of Britain (apart
from the established Church of Scotland). Certain other churches and religious
associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with some 601,070
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evan¬
gelical revival by John Wesley, and is nowadays based on a 1932 union of most
of the separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not
join the union include the Independent Methodists (some 5,650 members) and
the Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 4,520 members).
The United Reformed Church, with some 192,140 members, was formed
in 1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in
1813), within which 2,197 churches have a total membership of about 190,560;
in addition there are separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland
and other Baptist churches.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
(with some 140,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Pres¬
byterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 by Howell Harris and now numbers some

United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations in Britain include: the Unitarian and Free
Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States
of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community
in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the
Moravian Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free
Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in
1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; and the Congregational
Federation which was formed from Congregational churches which did not
enter the United Reformed Church. The Society of Friends (Quakers)—with
some 21,000 members in Britain—came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox and works for peace
and the relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 81
other countries. Within Britain it has some 177,400 active members operating
from more than 1,000 centres of worship and a total community strength of
about 350,000. Believing in a very practical expression of Christian concern,
the Salvation Army also has 193 centres providing help for some 30,000 people
in need.
There are also a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church) with about 71,640 members, and the Christian
Scientists with some 302 branch churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tem¬
porarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now 7 Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each under
an archbishop, 27 episcopal dioceses, and some 3,000 parishes. In Northern
Ireland, there are 7 dioceses, some of which have territory partly in the Irish
Republic. It is estimated that there are some 5-5 million adherents (including
children) to the Roman Catholic faith in the whole of Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. Many schools for Roman Catholic children in Britain are
staffed by members of the religious orders for men and women, who also
undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and the conduct of
homes for old people.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
Anglo-Jewish community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some
400,000 people, including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal)
and Ashkenazi (from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the
largest groups of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools
of thought—the Orthodox, to which about 80 per cent of practising Jews
belong; and the Reform, which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by
the Liberal Jewish movement. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group
(Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi
group. Synagogues in Britain number about 350. There has been an increase

in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now attended by
about one in five Jewish children.
Immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth and foreign countries have estab¬
lished centres of worship, especially in London, for their own communities.
Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries and the Armenian Church.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims and Buddhists. Hindu and Sikh temples have
been established in many areas where Asian immigrants have settled. There
are mosques or Islamic centres for Muslims in London, Manchester, Liver¬
pool, Bradford, Cardiff and in many of the other large cities in Britain. The
community’s headquarters are at the London Central Mosque and Islamic
Cultural Centre. The Buddhist Society has its headquarters in London, with
a Shrine Room and a Buddhist library claimed to be one of the finest in
Europe; there are also Shrine Rooms in the three Yiharas in London, one of
which is run by Thai monks and supported by the Thai Government. In
Scotland there is a Shrine Room at the Tibetan Centre.
The British Council of Churches, composed of representatives or consultant
observers from all the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates
common action among the churches and seeks to further Christian unity. It
works with the Conference of Missionary Societies of Great Britain and
Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales and aims to promote unity and joint action among the Free Churches
and to provide a channel for communication with central and local govern¬
ment authorities.
The Permanent Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission explores points of
possible unity between the two Churches.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also partici¬
pate in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of
Churches is an associated national council) which links together some 250
churches in over 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common
problems. The Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding
among members of the two religions and deals with problems in the social
field.
The New English Bible, a translation into modern English completed in
1970, is the result of co-operation among many of the Christian churches in
Britain.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made
by two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
11 The National
Economy
The features of fundamental importance to Britain’s economy are the con¬
tribution of manufacturing industry and services1 to the gross domestic
product—accounting, respectively, for about 30 and 45 per cent of the total
and the associated significance of international trade. Britain ranks fifth in
world trade (after the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan
and France) and accounts for over 6 per cent of the total. It takes about 9 per
cent of the world’s exports of primary products, and contributes over 9 per cent
to the main manufacturing countries’ exports of manufactured goods.
As a result of a high level of agricultural productivity, Britain provides just
over half the food it needs from its own soil (no other major industrial country
has such a small proportion of its working population engaged in agriculture—
about 2-9 per cent). The remaining agricultural supplies are imported, Britain
being among the world’s largest importers of such products as wheat, meat,
butter, fodder grains, fruit, tea, tobacco and wool. Other imports include raw
materials (such as metallic ores, crude oil and timber) and semi-manufactures
(for example, chemicals and textile yarns).
The imports are paid for by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods and by
invisible exports—earnings on overseas investment, travel, civil aviation,
British-owned shipping, financial, banking, insurance and other services.
Britain is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles,
electrical equipment, finished textiles and most types of machinery. The
country’s competitive ability strongly influences the economic growth rate and
the standard of living. The gross domestic product per head of population
rose in real terms by about 29 per cent between 1963 and 1973.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in
large measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre.
Its banks, insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions
provide worldwide financial services. The City of London provides perhaps
the most comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
Earlier
Development
of the Economy
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker and investor and its fast growing
economy supported a rapidly increasing population. In the period from 1870 to
1890 British industry had a clear lead over that of other countries. Between
1890 and 1914, industrial competition from Europe and North America grew,
but its effects on Britain’s export industries, particularly cotton textiles and
coal, were offset by a number of factors including the rise in world trade and
the returns on Britain’s large overseas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing com¬
petition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European countries
1 Services in this context cover transport, communication, distributive trades, insurance,
banking, finance, public health and education, and other services excluding public
administration, defence and ownership of dwellings.
IQO BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and in textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper. The
result was heavy unemployment.
After 1932 levels of production and employment improved. The decade saw
a strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemical and aircraft industries,
while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the
building and ancillary industries.
The Second World In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the second
War and After world war ran down British domestic capital by about £2,000 million, through
shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and
replacements. Some ^1,000 million worth of overseas investments were sold,
nearly half in North America, and new external debts of £3,000 million were
accumulated. By 1944 exports had fallen to less than one-third of their 1938
volume.
After the second world war rationing and other war-time controls were
relaxed gradually as civil production expanded and trade recovered. The
abolition of quantitative restrictions on imports, other than from the dollar
area, was largely completed by 1955. Exchange controls on transactions
between the sterling area and the rest of the world were also for the most part
lifted, and in 1958 convertibility of sterling on current account for all non¬
residents was introduced.

ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The objectives of the Government in managing the economy are to achieve a
steady rate of growth, rising exports and investment, and a high level of
employment. Its policies are carried out by the main government departments
with economic responsibilities on a national scale: the Treasury, the Depart¬
ments of Trade, Industry, Employment, Energy, Prices and Consumer
Protection, and the Environment, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food.
An important advisory body on general economic policy is the National
Economic Development Council, which brings together representatives of
government, management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister. It has an independent but publicly financed secretariat and
has established a number of economic development committees dealing with
different industries and services and different aspects of industry. Other
bodies responsible for advice on specific aspects of policy include the National
Joint Advisory Council (on labour matters), the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (on action to prevent the abuse of monopoly power, see p. 204)
and the Office of Manpower Economics (which provides the secretariat for
bodies advising on certain wages and salaries in the public sector and under¬
takes research on pay questions generally).
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy,
and problems such as inflation and industrial relations, the Government makes
known its purposes, and keeps in touch with developments throughout the
economy, by means of informal and continuous links with the chief industrial,
financial, labour and other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of
economic policy rests with the Cabinet (see p. 42) which alone can take into
account all the political, social and economic considerations.
The Secretary of State for the Environment has responsibilities for regional
planning in England, which is carried out with the help of the Regional
Economic Planning Councils and Economic Planning Boards. There is a
council and a board in each of the eight economic planning regions: Northern,
Guidance of the

Economic Growth
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IQI
Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, South East, South
West, West Midlands and North West. The councils, which are advisory
bodies, comprise part-time members with wide experience of their regions.
They help in the preparation of broad economic and land-use strategies which
provide a regional framework for national and local planning and investment
decisions. The boards consist of senior officials in the regions of the govern¬
ment departments concerned with aspects of regional planning. They co¬
ordinate the regional work of departments and provide the councils with
information and advice.
Scotland also has an Economic Council and an Economic Planning Board;
there is a Welsh Council and a Welsh Planning Board; and Northern Ireland
has an Economic Council.
The period since 1945 has been one of rising production and, until 1970, a
low level of unemployment (generally 2-5 per cent or lower); but economic
growth, which averaged 2 to 3 per cent up to 1971, was rather slower and more
intermittent than in most other western European countries. There were also
certain persistent economic problems, such as periodic difficulties with the
balance of payments especially during periods of relatively high pressure of
demand. In spite of the contribution from invisibles, there were substantial
deficits on current account in a number of years.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these problems in
a number of ways, sometimes restraining the growth in home demand and
implementing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices.
Following the devaluation of sterling in 1967, from $2.80 to $2.40 = .£1,
exports recovered, leading to a substantial surplus on visible trade and a
record current account surplus by 1971.
In July 1971 the Government embarked on a reflationary policy designed to
raise the economic growth rate and so reduce the unemployment rate, which
had begun to rise rapidly. This was combined with a programme of longer-
term reform of the structure within which the economy operates. Measures
over the following 18 months included an increase in investment incentives
(see p. 205), changes in the administration of regional policy (see p. 205), a
reform of the framework of the taxation system (see p. 360) and the establish¬
ment of a new system of control over money and credit (see p. 365). Consumer
demand was strongly stimulated by reductions in taxation and the bringing
forward of certain public spending programmes in order to make use of under¬
employed resources.
By the early part of 1973 the economy was growing rapidly. Growth over
the period from the second half of 1971 to the first quarter of 1973 was about
5 per cent a year. Industrial production, consumers’ expenditure and the
volume of exports were all rising rapidly, industrial investment had begun to
recover and the unemployment rate, which had reached 3 -8 per cent at the
beginning of 1972, was down to 2-7 per cent by April 1973. Living standards
(measured in terms of real personal disposable income) had increased more
rapidly in 1972 than at any time since 1945, and had risen by 10 per cent since
mid-1970. By the latter part of 1973 economic growth was slowing down
in line with the Government’s policy of preventing serious shortages of
materials and manpower. With the onset of the world energy crisis towards
the end of the year, however, coinciding with three industrial disputes,
special measures were necessary for a time to conserve energy; this had the
effect of reducing production so that, for example, industrial production

during the first quarter of 1974 was nearly 6 per cent below the level of the
previous quarter. Most of the direct restrictions on the use of energy were
removed in March, and by May production reached a level only slightly below
that of May 1973. In July the Government took measures designed to increase
employment and help industry by their effect on demand and by encouraging
investment and reducing labour costs.
In controlling the money supply the Government has been concerned to
ensure sufficient liquidity to support the growth of output but at the same
time to avoid excessive monetary expansion in a period of inflationary
pressures. During 1973, as during the previous year, increased bank lending in
sterling to the private sector (a rise of ^5,500 million) was an important factor
in the rapid monetary expansion. Structural changes following the introduction
in 1971 of a new system of credit control (see p. 365) also continued to influence
the recorded increases in the money supply. As the economy approached full
capacity, successive steps were taken to restrain the increase in money and
credit. Several calls were made by the Bank of England for special deposits
(which reduce the reserve assets base of the banking system). At the same
time banks were requested to restrict inessential lending so that priority
could be given to finance for essential purposes, such as investment and
exports. Following the restrictive measures interest rates rose to reach high
levels towards the end of the year. In December 1973 a scheme was introduced
for supplementary deposits to be paid by banks to the Bank of England if
certain of their liabilities grew by more than a specified guideline rate (see
p. 365), the intention being to restrain growth of money supply more directly.
In the first months of 1974 the pace of the monetary expansion slackened sub¬
stantially, with the growth of bank liabilities generally well within the guideline
rate. Interest rates remained at high levels, as in other countries, but there was
some easing of short-term rates following repayments of special deposits to the
banks.
Towards the end of 1972 inflation, which had gathered momentum in Britain
as in most other industrial countries in the 1950s and 1960s, had become one
of the Government’s most intractable problems. Table 9 gives a broad
indication of the rate of inflation in Britain since 1963. A number of influences,
including rapidly rising world prices for food and raw materials (which
Britain has to import in large quantities, see p. 375) and rising wage rates had
combined to bring about an acceleration in price rises. During 1972 tripartite
discussions on inflation and the management of the economy were held
between the Government, the Confederation of British Industry (see p. 346)
and the Trades Union Congress (see p. 347). In the absence of agreement on
a voluntary system of wage control, however, the Government introduced a
statutory counter-inflation policy, beginning with a standstill (Stage One) on
increases in most prices and in rents, dividends and pay in November 1972.
Under Stage Two, which began in April 1973 under the Counter-Inflation
Act 1973 and lasted until November, control was exerted on price, pay and
other increases through the operation of a Price and Pay Code enforced by
two independent statutory agencies, the Price Commission and the Pay Board.
Under Stage Three the code was revised to provide for continued strict con¬
trols over prices and profits (with modifications to facilitate investment), while
allowing more flexibility in wage negotiations within prescribed limits.
During 1973 retail prices rose by 11 per cent, import prices by 43 per cent
and prices of raw materials by 47 per cent (including a very substantial increase

in oil prices in the last quarter1). Average earnings during 1973 rose by 13 per
cent.

The new Government, which took office in March 1974, announced its
intention to secure the orderly growth of incomes on a voluntary basis and in
July abolished the Pay Board and its associated statutory controls on pay. (In
June the Trades Union Congress had issued a statement setting out in detail
the guidelines for new wage claims it expected its member unions to observe
after the end of statutory pay control.) A number of measures were also
taken to reinforce the Price Code and to restrain directly rises in prices,
rents and rates. The measures included the payment of food subsidies (includ¬
ing those on milk, butter, household flour, certain kinds of bread and the most
important varieties of cheese and tea), a standstill on rents until 31st December
1974, a reduction in the rate of value added tax and the granting of additional
powers to the Price Commission for preventing and restricting increases in
prices and charges.
In Britain’s mixed economy, direct state intervention in industry and com¬
merce (as well as in social, cultural and other affairs) is often effected through
special public corporations set up, usually by statute, to deal with a particular
activity. Though not a part of a government department, the corporations are
under varying degrees of public control. The most important are those which
in the public interest operate major nationalised industries—including coal,
electricity, gas, steel, railways, airports and air transport, inland transport and
postal services. These industries and services are described in their relevant
sections. Altogether about 8 per cent of all employees work for these bodies.
Their managing boards and staffs are chosen for their experience and com¬
petence in a particular field; they are not civil servants, and, although account¬
able to Parliament for their actions in a variety of ways, it is they and not the
ministers of the sponsoring departments who are responsible for management.
Certain of the nationalised industries are self-supporting; others receive
Exchequer grants to help them to carry out duties with which they have been
charged.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how
the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management.
It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any in¬
formation, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice,
as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions
are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to
issue a formal directive.
1 As a result of decisions by oil producing countries, oil prices doubled between the
middle and end of 1973 and doubled again with effect from 1st January 1974, so that
raw materials prices were by then, 65 per cent higher than in January 1973-

The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
that receipts at least balance outgoings over a period. However, financial
targets have been agreed by the Government with the different industries (or
are under discussion) ranging from 12*4 per cent gross return on capital
employed to ‘breaking even’ after interest and depreciation have been allowed
for. In addition the industries are expected to apply a test discount rate of 10
per cent for new investment. The responsible minister is usually empowered,
subject to Treasury approval, to say what shall be done with any surplus
revenues which may accrue. As regards finance for capital expenditure, the
present system is that finance which cannot be met from internal sources is
provided mainly by interest-bearing loans from the Exchequer and in certain
cases by borrowing from abroad.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is generally done by the establishment of
representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and suggestions
made to them, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes they
think desirable.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. A sessional
House of Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries examines
the reports and accounts of the nationalised industries. (Its powers of investiga¬
tion also include several other public corporations such as the Independent
Broadcasting Authority, Cable and Wireless Limited and certain activities of
the Bank of England.)
The main economic adjustments provided for in the Treaty of Accession to
the European Community are detailed in Chapter 3 and in other relevant
chapters. The Government formed in March 1974 has put forward proposals
intended to modify the economic effects of some Community policies on
Britain and other countries (see p. 76).
In the years following devaluation in 1967 exports of goods and services
increased rapidly in real terms. Helped by a record surplus on current transac¬
tions of over £1,000 million in 1971, and by massive capital inflows, the
reserves stood at the high level of just over £2,74° rnillion by the end of May
1972, after the repayment of all official short- and medium-term debt.
In 1972 the trade balance began to deteriorate; imports were swollen by the
rapid growth of domestic demand, and exports were affected by various factors
including the slower growth of world trade. This deterioration, together with
growing fears about inflation, led to a large outflow of short-term speculative
capital in June 1972, and the Government decided to allow the pound to float
and applied exchange control to transactions with the overseas sterling area.
The lower sterling exchange rate made Britain highly competitive, and the
volume of exports, which had not changed from 1971 to 1972, increased by
almost 12 per cent in 1973. However, mainly as a result of rising prices of
imports, including oil (see pp. 192-3), there was a large deficit on the current
account in 1973, despite a big increase in the positive invisible balance (see
p. 378). In the first half of 1974 there was a large rise in the value of exports

and a reduction in the non-oil visible trade deficit, but the current account
deficit increased, mainly because of higher oil prices. In future years increasing
supplies of oil from the North Sea (see p. 261) can be expected to bring
considerable advantage to the balance of payments, although the extent of the
benefit is difficult to judge at this stage.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SITUATION
In December 1971, following a period of uncertainty in international exchange
markets, particularly affecting the United States dollar, a general international
realignment of exchange rates was agreed at a meeting held in the Smithsonian
Institute in Washington, in which all the main currencies were in effect re¬
valued against the dollar. (The rates of exchange fixed in that agreement are
called Smithsonian parities.) As part of this realignment, the sterling rate for
the dollar moved up by just over 8^ per cent, the new middle rate being
$2.60571 compared with the old par value of $2.40. This was the direct result
of the US decision to raise the dollar value of monetary gold from $35 to $38
per fine ounce.
The exchange markets continued to be unsettled during 1972 and early
1973, causing a number of further adjustments and flotations. By the end of
March 1973, the dollar had been devalued by a further 10 per cent against
gold, thus raising the official price of gold to $42.22 a fine ounce and increasing
the parity rate of the pound to $2.89524. The yen had been floated; the
deutschemark had been revalued by 3 per cent against gold; six Community
countries (Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands) maintained their margins scheme (intro¬
duced in May 1972, under which rates between any two of their currencies
could not diverge from their cross parities by more than 2^ per cent), but no
longer maintained margins for the US dollar; Sweden and Norway joined the
Community scheme; and Britain, the Irish Republic and Italy continued to
float independently.1 At the end of 1973 and beginning of 1974 the dislocations
imposed on most economies as a result of the large increase in the price of oil
caused further disturbances in foreign exchange markets; in January 1974,
France allowed the franc to float, and in so doing departed from the Com¬
munity scheme.
The Sterling Agreements originally negotiated in 1968 with the main holders
of official sterling balances expired in September 1973. The agreements had
provided a guarantee in terms of the US dollar on condition that certain
minimum proportions of countries’ reserves were kept in sterling. The
guarantee was extended by Britain until March 1974 but on terms which
prevented any increase in the amount of sterling guaranteed. A further exten¬
sion until the end of 1974 was expressed in terms of the effective rate for

The Committee of Twenty (representative of the major industrial and the

Monetary Fund (IMF) framework, concluded its work on the reform of the
international monetary system in June 1974. The committee agreed on a

method of valuation of the special drawing right (SDR—an international
reserve asset) for an interim period, recommended special measures to assist
developing countries and to combat inflation, and guidelines for the manage¬
ment of floating exchange rates, and proposed the setting up of a new body in
the IMF to further the work of reform. The committee agreed on some
principles of corrective action (in particular, avoidance of deflation and of
exchange rate depreciation) for countries with balance of payments dis-
equilibria, especially with regard to those nations experiencing large payments
deficits as a result of the impact of the increase in oil prices.

NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
The following sections sketch briefly the structure and disposal of Britain’s
national income in recent years.
In 1973 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the total
value of goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is
estimated to have amounted to £63,271 million. In real terms, that is, after
allowing for price changes, the increase over the 10 years since 1963 was nearly
33 per cent.
About a third of total output can be attributed to manufacturing industry

and this proportion has remained more or less constant for a number of years.
The expanding industry groups in recent years (in relation to the economy as

finance, public administration and health and educational services. Agri¬
culture, forestry and fishing have accounted for a small and slowly declining
share, and mining for a small and more rapidly declining share. The relative

“ Including value of physical change in stocks and work in progress (£674 million
in 1973).
The main trends since 1963 are a fall in the proportion of total available
output devoted to personal consumption and to public authorities’ current
expenditure and a significant rise in the proportion devoted to exports.
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from under £25,600 million in 1963 to over £61,goo million in 1973—a
compound rate of about 9 per cent a year. The increase in consumer expen¬
diture at constant prices has, however, been just under 3 per cent a year. The
difference is accounted for mainly by rising prices and to a lesser extent by a
higher incidence of direct taxation and increased personal savings.
Income from employment in 1973 totalled £42,890 million and accounted
for about 69 per cent of total personal income (compared with about 71 per
cent in 1963). The three other main sources of personal income were self-
employment (10 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (10 per
cent), and grants from public authorities (10 per cent). The general pattern
of income distribution is thus dominated by income from employment. Of the
relatively small amount of income from rent, dividends and interest, almost
one-third goes to life assurance and superannuation funds, and benefits, there¬
fore, many people of moderate means. In so far as these forms of income

accrue to the more wealthy people, this is to some extent counterbalanced by
the effect of grants from public authorities to those in need.
British direct taxation falls heavily on the rich and the combined effect of
taxation and transfer payments and benefits in kind is a redistribution of
income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies by the Central Statis¬
tical Office, the effect in 1972 was to raise the highest income among the poorest
fifth of households (that is, the income at the lowest quintile) from 29 to 53
per cent of the median income of all households. There are a number of
theoretical and practical limitations to these studies, but the broad result is
too marked to be in dispute.

The rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in
Britain as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern.
The proportions of expenditure devoted to food and tobacco have been falling
while the proportion spent on housing has risen. These and other changes are
shown in Table 12.
Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government and
local authorities rose by about 26 per cent at 1970 market prices over the
period 1963 to 1973 when it amounted to about 21 per cent of the gross
domestic product. The main cause of this increase was the continuing growth
of the social services, especially education. Defence has recently accounted
for a declining share of public expenditure on goods and services—24 per cent
in 1973 compared with 37 per cent in 1963 and a post-war peak of 48 per cent
in 1953-
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies (see pp. 125 and 179)- The Government also makes grants to local
authorities to finance about 50 per cent of their current expenditure.
Gross domestic fixed capital formation represents about 22 per cent of the
gross domestic product at factor cost. The total value of fixed assets in Britain,
valued at constant replacement cost, is estimated to have increased by 48 per
cent between 1963 and 1973 when their current replacement value, net of
depreciation, was some £197,300 million, of which about two-thirds was
accounted for by buildings and one-third by plant and machinery, and vehicles.
Within the total of gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1973 (£10,004
million compared with £9,020 million in 1968 at constant prices) private
sector investment accounted for 12-9 per cent of the gross domestic product at
factor cost (11-4 per cent in 1968) and the public sector for 8-3 per cent
(i0'2 per cent). The approximate shares of industry groups in total fixed
investment in 1973 were (1968 figures in brackets): manufacturing, 19 per
cent (20 per cent), gas, electricity and water, 6 per cent (n per cent), transport
and communications, 14 per cent (12 per cent), distributive trades, 6 per cent
(5 per cent), dwellings, 18 per cent (19 per cent), social and other public
services, 16 per cent (15 per cent), and other industries,1 21 per cent (18 per
cent). There is a marked cyclical pattern in the flow of investment by manu¬
facturing industry; it was at a low point in 1967 and 1972 but rose in 1973.
Among the trends over recent years have been increases in investment in
agriculture, mining (other than coal mining), shipping and retail distribution.
Saving has made a significant contribution to the rising levels of investment
in all the main sectors of the economy. The extent to which each sector contri¬
buted on balance, by way of lending, to the capital formation of the other
sectors (and to net investment abroad) in 1971-73 or drew on the saving of
the other sectors is shown by the sector’s net acquisition of financial assets
(see Table 13).
The main features of 1973 were the large financial deficit of the public
sector and the large financial surplus of the overseas sector (which equals net
overseas investment in Britain).

service industries.

The public sector’s financial deficit (a negative net acquisition of financial
assets) increased substantially in 1973 to some £2,757 million, 64 per cent
above 1972. Much of the public sector’s deficit in 1973 was financed by
borrowing overseas, especially in the euro-currency market. Local authorities
and nationalised industries accounted for most of the £1,100 million borrowed
from overseas under the exchange cover scheme. (The exchange cover scheme,
reintroduced in March 1973, safeguards public sector borrowers against the
risk of loss resulting from changes in the exchange rate. The previous scheme
had been suspended in 1971 following an excessive inflow of dollars). The
central Government’s borrowing requirement was covered largely by sales of
debt to the non-bank public. The public sector’s capital formation at current
prices was some £1,000 million higher, and saving by central Government was
reduced as a result of the rapid increase in current expenditure overtaking a
more modest growth in revenue. Both public corporations and local authorities
had increased surpluses on current account, although in the case of local
authorities this reflected increased central government grants which con¬
tributed to the reduction in central government saving. The company sector
was in deficit in 1973 (following a surplus in 1972) as company stocks rose
sharply and fixed capital formation increased. The personal sector increased
its net acquisition of financial assets by increasing its saving. National Savings
reached the record end-of-year level of £10,449 million in 1973, net savings
during the year totalling some £362 million (see p. 367).
12 Production and
Distribution
Production industries (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction
and gas, electricity and water) and distributive trades together account for
more than half of Britain’s gross domestic product, manufacturing for some
31 per cent and distributive trades 10 per cent. About 55 per cent of Britain’s
employed labour force is engaged in these sectors, while over 80 per cent of
Britain’s visible exports consists of manufactured or semi-manufactured pro¬
ducts. The following sections discuss general industrial topics—such as
investment, productivity, location and the Government’s relations with
industry—together with manufacturing industry, construction and distributive
and service trades. For the energy industries (coal, gas, petroleum and
electricity) see Chapter 13.
GENERAL STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION
Structure The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from
such large-scale organisations as the General Electric Company (211,000
employees) and Imperial Chemical Industries (199,000), and the public
corporations such as the National Coal Board with about 330,000 employees,
to the many thousands of small firms, some with fewer than 25 employees
but accounting for something like one-fifth of the gross national product.
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include
iron, steel and a small range of chemicals from the plants of the British Steel
Corporation; aero-engines made by Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd.; locomotives and
rolling-stock built in the workshops of British Railways; military equipment
and supplies made in establishments of the defence services and fissile materials
and radioactive isotopes, made by two statutory companies (see p. 230).
Certain factories giving employment to the severely disabled are operated by
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company partly financed by the
Department of Employment. In addition the Government holds about 49 per
cent of the equity of a major oil company, British Petroleum Limited, and
has an interest in a number of other companies.
The most recent complete analysis of the size distribution of establishments
and enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration,
is contained in the Report on the Census of Production ig68. This shows that
some 64 per cent (59,000) of the 92,000 or so establishments which submitted
returns had fewer than 25 employees each, and accounted for 7 per cent of
total employment; some 28,000 establishments, nearly one-third of the total,
had between 25-500 employees, and accounted for over two-fifths of the total
labour force; 2,400 establishments, each with between 500 and 2,000 em¬
ployees, were responsible for 28 per cent of employment; while 21 per cent
was in the hands of the 409 leading groups each with over 2,000 employees. A
high proportion of the biggest establishments were in the heavy industries;
202
Industrial
Association
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the average size of establishments in industries making consumer goods was
smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results
obtained in earlier years suggested a slow but significant trend towards in¬
creased average size of establishments.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manu¬
facturing enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establishments,
not all of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities. An enter¬
prise, as defined in the 1968 census, normally consists of either a single firm
or a parent company together with its subsidiaries. Just over 34 per cent of all
employment in British manufacturing industries in 1968 was accounted for
by more than 1,000 large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people,
the largest 100 or so accounting roughly for a third. A further indication of
company size is the value of capital employed (net assets). In the case of three
companies, the Imperial Chemical Industries group, British Petroleum and
Shell Transport and Trading, the figure exceeds £2,000 million; about 91
companies registered in Britain have over ^100 million net assets. Of the top
20 industrial groups in Europe in terms of annual sales, five are British.
With intensified competition in the economy and, in many branches of
industry, the growing dependence of profitable operation on concentration and
economies of scale, the trend towards mergers and regrouping has gathered
momentum in recent years. Larger units of control have been established in
almost all the leading industries and in some a small number of big companies
and their subsidiaries are responsible for a very large proportion of total
production. Examples are oil refining, non-ferrous metal smelting, motor
vehicles and aircraft, heavy electrical engineering, electronics, machine tools,
brewing, textiles, basic chemicals, tobacco and magazine publishing. Shares
in these companies are, however, usually distributed among a great number of
holders or are held by insurance companies or pension funds representing a
broad cross-section of the community, and it is rare for a few large holders to
have a controlling interest. For example, more than 40 of the largest public
companies each have more than 100,000 shareholders.
Private industrial undertakings have increasingly entered into voluntary
association for a number of different purposes, including the provision of
common services, the exchange of information and representation of their
members’ point of view; the regulation of trading practices; and negotiation
with trade unions on wages and conditions of work. Associations for these
purposes cover, with varying completeness, most of British industry. Trade
associations, concerned mainly with representation to the Government, the
provision of common services and the regulation of trading practices are
normally composed of firms manufacturing a particular product or group of
products. Employers’ organisations which deal with employment matters
usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of operation or manufacturing
process. In an industrial sector concerned wholly with an allied group of
products, a single association may undertake all the required functions.
There are more than 100 national federations and some 1,400 employers’
organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of the
national federations) concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of
work (see p. 346). The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned
with providing common services is not known precisely but is thought to
total some 1,200 varying greatly in importance, structure and activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI) recognised by the Government as a channel for
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
203
The
Government
and Industry
Competition

consultation between government departments and representatives of private
employers as a whole. For its members it acts as an advisory and consultative
body providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining their col¬
lective views and representing them nationally to the Government and the
public and also internationally, for example in the Council of European
Industrial Federations. CBI representatives sit on the National Economic
Development Council and on a number of official advisory committees and
voluntary bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of some 12,000 companies and about 230
employers’ organisations and trade and commercial associations. Nationalised
industries have joined as industrial associates. The CBI has a regional organisa¬
tion in Britain and is widely represented abroad. In matters of common concern
the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers of commerce. These are open to
all kinds of producers and traders and exist to promote the interests of local
industry and commerce. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce,
founded in i860, is the central organisation to which approximately 100 local
chambers of commerce (together with 20 British Chambers of Commerce
operating abroad) are affiliated. In Scotland there is an additional central
organisation, the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland,
the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry to which local
chambers are affiliated.
Within the framework of economic and social policy as a whole it has been a
continuing aim of government policy to promote the expansion and modernisa¬
tion of industry and at the same time to develop an effective solution to the
problems of regional imbalances. The Government has traditionally sought to
influence industrial activity in a number of ways—through fiscal and monetary
policy, through the level of public expenditure, by incentives for industrial
investment and by the provision of services, information and advice. Legislative
arrangements have been developed to control aspects of employment, mono¬
polies, mergers and restrictive practices and new industrial and office building
and changes in land use.
The Department of Industry, which took over the appropriate functions of
the former Department of Trade and Industry in March 1974, is responsible
for industrial policy as a whole on both a national and regional level. In
particular, it is responsible for the sponsorship of individual industries; for
industrial development and finance; for the provision of technical services to
industry; and for industrial research and development, including the super¬
vision of a number of industrial research establishments. In Northern Ireland
the Department of Commerce deals with industry and industrial development.
Related responsibilities (for example, those of the Department of Employment
for manpower affairs) are discussed in the appropriate chapters.
In addition there is close association between industry and the Government
through such channels as the National Economic Development Council, the
main forum for consultation between the Government, management and the
trade unions, and the Economic Development Committees (EDCs) which cover
particular industrial sectors.
The EDCs bring together leading representatives of government, manage¬
ment and unions to study, and make recommendations on, the efficiency and
prospects of individual industries.
Competition policy in Britain is based on the machinery which has been
established to scrutinise monopolies, mergers and restrictive trade practices
204
European
Community

and Mergers
Restrictive
Trade Practices
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
so as to establish whether structural changes or uncompetitive situations
operate against the public interest as defined in the relevant legislation—
primarily the Fair Trading Act 1973, which amends or consolidates the
Monopolies and Mergers Acts 1948 and 1965 and the Restrictive Trades
Practices Acts 1956 and 1968. Under the Fair Trading Act the Director General
of Fair Trading carries out functions in relation to monopoly situations,
mergers and restrictive trading practices, in addition to his work on consumer
protection.
Competition policy in the context of the European Community is designed to
remove all restraints on competition between member states of which the
economic effects are not likely to be beneficial. The objective of Community
rules on competition is to ban restrictive practices which distort competition
between members, and to prohibit the abuse of ‘dominant positions’ within
the Community. An important point is that the restraint on trade or the abuse
of a dominant position must be likely to have an adverse effect on trade between
member states; otherwise the Community rules on competition are in¬
applicable.
The Fair Trading Act replaces, with revised provision, the Monopolies and
Mergers Acts 1948 and 1965 and makes several changes to widen the scope
within which monopoly and merger situations can be referred—by the Director
General of Fair Trading or by the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer
Protection—for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The market share by reference to which monopoly is defined is now reduced
from one-third to one-quarter, and there are new powers to refer local mono¬
polies and public sector industries to the commission. If the commission finds
that monopoly conditions operate against the public interest (for example, the
commission must take into account the need to maintain and promote the
balanced distribution of industry and employment in Britain) the Department
of Prices and Consumer Protection has powers to make orders and otherwise
to remedy or prevent the harm which the commission considers may result.
The Director General also has the duty, when requested by ministers, of
negotiating undertakings with the firms concerned following a commission
report, of advising on the use of the order-making power and of supervising
the observance of undertakings or orders.
A merger may be referred to the commission by the Secretary of State for
Prices and Consumer Protection if it results in, or intensifies, a monopoly
situation, or if the value of gross assets taken over exceeds £5 million. There
are special provisions relating to newspaper and certain other mergers. The
Director General has the same task of advising on the action to be taken
following a commission report on a merger reference that he has in relation to
monopoly reports.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Acts 1956 and 1968 as amended by the Fair
Trading Act 1973 govern the registration and judicial examination of restrictive
agreements. They require the entry in a public register of the particulars of a
wide range of restrictive agreements (including those relating to common
prices, approved lists of dealers and the limitation of production) which affect
the supply of goods or commercial services for the British market. Proposed
agreements of national importance which promote efficiency or provide
for new productive capacity can be exempted from this requirement for a
specified period by the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Pro¬
tection. The Director General of Fair Trading is responsible for keeping the

register and for bringing agreements before the Restrictive Practices Court set
up under the 1956 Act. The Secretary of State can discharge the Director
General from this duty if a registered agreement contains restrictions of only
little significance. If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the court that
special circumstances set out in the legislation exist, and that the restriction
is not unreasonable, having regard to the balance between the benefit it confers
and any public detriment likely to result from its operation, that restriction
must be found contrary to the public interest. Agreements are void in respect
of restrictions so found. The court can make orders preventing the parties from
operating their agreement, or from making new arrangements having the same
effect. Agreements relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this pro¬
cedure but have to be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading and to
the Commission of the European Community. Registration and judicial
examination applied originally to arrangements relating to goods but were
extended to agreements relating to commercial services in 1974 under the
provisions of the Fair Trading Act.
Under the 1956 Act collective enforcement of resale price maintenance was
prohibited, but individual suppliers remained free to enforce minimum resale
prices in the courts. The Resale Prices Act 1964 made resale price maintenance
generally unlawful, except in respect of classes of goods exempted by the
Restrictive Practices Court. Only two classes of goods (books and medicaments)
have been exempted; nearly 500 classes have been refused exemption.
Britain has a more generous system of national incentives for industrial
development than any other member country of the European Community or
the United States. Under the Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage capital
expenditure in plant and machinery take the form of a system of free deprecia¬
tion enabling the whole of such expenditure to be written off against profits
for tax purposes in the year in which it is incurred; there is in addition a 40
per cent initial allowance on new industrial buildings and structures and an
annual writing down allowance of 4 per cent. Direct investment from overseas
is also encouraged, and overseas firms are offered the same facilities and
incentives as those applying to British-owned companies.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due to the steady
decline over the years of older industries, such as coalmining and shipbuilding,
causing a high level of unemployment in certain regions and such adverse
factors as poor amenities, derelict buildings and land and net outward migra¬
tion.
The newer and expanding industries have tended to develop mostly in
the Midlands and the South East, and unemployment has remained a persistent
problem in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some parts of England,
particularly the North and Merseyside. The ending of regional imbalance has
been an objective of successive Governments. Financial and other aid to areas
of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has been expanded considerably
over the years.
The map (see p. 206) shows those parts of the country where preferential
assistance is offered by the Government to encourage industrial development.
The assisted areas consist of the whole of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland
and the North Region; almost all of the North West and Yorkshire and
Humberside regions; parts of the South West and East Midlands regions; and
Oswestry in the West Midlands. There are three different categories of

assisted area: special development areas, where the need for jobs is most
acute, development areas and intermediate areas. In addition the derelict land
clearance areas received, up to March 1974, some of the help available in the
intermediate areas.
In the assisted areas, the basic investment incentives were supplemented
under the Industry Act 1972 by a new system of regional development grants.
These are cash grants towards the cost of plant, machinery, buildings and
works on premises used wholly or mainly for specified activities in manu¬
facturing, construction and mining. Unlike the building and operational grants
formerly available under the Local Employment Acts, these grants are not
limited to projects creating employment, and are thus available to help with
improvements and modernisation. In addition, they are not treated as reducing
the capital expenditure which qualifies for capital allowances for tax purposes.
The Industry Act also provides for selective financial assistance for projects
which are likely to provide, maintain or safeguard employment in any part of
the assisted areas. Assistance may be provided in a number of forms, the usual
forms for employment-creating projects being loans at concessionary rates of
interest, interest relief grants and removal grants. In the year ended 31st
March 1974 some £107 million was paid in regional development grants under
the Industry Act, together with regional selective assistance of £50 million.
By that date over 1,000 projects involving the creation of more than 72,000
new jobs had received assistance under the legislation. Loans are also available
on favourable terms from the European Investment Bank and the European
Coal and Steel Community.
Some other forms of assistance under the previous system continue to be
available. These include the provision of modern factories for sale or rent on
favourable terms in the development and intermediate areas, and grants to
ease the transfer or establishment of a business and its key workers in the
development and intermediate areas. Factory building and estate management
are undertaken on the Department of Industry’s behalf by the English, Scottish
and Welsh Industrial Estates Corporations; premises administered by the
three corporations total over 73 million square feet and give employment to
over 230,000 people. In addition to financial incentives, a more direct influence
on the location of industry is provided by the control exercised by the Govern¬
ment, through the granting of industrial development certificates (IDCs), on
the building of new factories. The purpose of this control is to direct potentially
mobile projects towards the areas of greatest employment need.
Within the Department of Industry there is an Industrial Development
Executive under a Minister of State with special responsibility for regional
policy and regional industrial development. Within the executive an Industrial
Development Unit helps with the appraisal, negotiation and monitoring of
projects referred to it. The Minister is assisted by an Industrial Development
Advisory Board, made up of members prominent in industry, banking,
accounting and finance and international industrial investment, to advise
generally on industry-wide problems and priorities, and to consider specific
major cases for selective assistance.
The department’s regional organisation also has been given an important
degree of authority for dealing with applications for selective financial assis¬
tance. Regional Industrial Development Boards have been set up in Scotland,
Wales, the North, North West, Yorkshire and Humberside and South West
regions. The boards advise generally on regional industrial opportunities and
on applications for selective financial assistance for the development of industry

in their regions. The links between Regional Economic Planning Councils and
Boards and the department’s regional offices have been strengthened so that
the process of industrial regeneration in a region and the planning of its land
use and other physical resources can be properly co-ordinated.
Under separate legislation capital grants are available at 30 per cent of the cost
of new buildings, machinery and equipment for the manufacturing, construc¬
tion and extractive industries in Northern Ireland. Total expenditure inclu¬
sive of grants qualifies for tax allowances. There is also provision for assisting
firms by means of loans to carry out major schemes of re-equipment, to move
to another area in particular need of industrial development or to undertake a
rehousing of their business in association with a major scheme of modernisa¬
tion and reorganisation. Help under the capital grants legislation is made
without regard to how much employment is created as a result.
As an alternative means of assistance in Northern Ireland comprehensive
and flexible powers are offered under the Industries Development Acts for
projects which offer a reasonable amount of employment. In such cases
individual development grants of up to 40 per cent of expenditure on new
buildings, machinery and equipment are available, with tax allowances as
above. For those projects which offer exceptionally attractive returns in em¬
ployment or location within Northern Ireland, the assistance offered can
include tenancy of a government-built factory at low rent (including possibly
a rent-free period), grants towards operating costs in the initial stages, and
grants towards costs of removing existing machinery and installing it in a
factory in Northern Ireland.
Since 1945 some 300 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland
with government assistance, and the number of people now employed in
grant-aided industry totals over 83,000. A Finance Corporation with an initial
capital of £50 million was formed in 1972 to aid industrial and commercial
concerns which have short-term liquidity problems but long-term prospects of
viability.
Certain regions and areas in England have industrial development associations
concerned with promoting local industry and sponsored mainly by local
authorities, trade associations and individual firms.
Several voluntary associations are concerned with Welsh industry. The
Development Corporation for Wales, founded in 1959, being the most
prominent. In Scotland, the Highlands and Islands Development Board, a
statutory body, works to stimulate the economic and social development of
the seven ‘crofting’ counties (see p. 291). It provides grants and loans to
industrial, commercial and other enterprises; it may also acquire land, provide
management and other advisory services and set up and carry on businesses.
The Scottish Council (Development and Industry), a voluntary association,
works to promote the general economic development of Scotland.
Encouragement is also given to the development of rural industries. Much of
this work is done under the aegis of the Development Commission. In
England and Wales this service is provided by the Council for Small Industries
in Rural Areas acting in consultation with the Rural Community Councils
through their Small Industries Committees in the counties; by the Small
Industries Council for Rural Areas of Scotland; and in Northern Ireland by
the Local Enterprise Development Unit of the Department of Commerce. All
these agencies provide advice and guidance to small businesses in rural areas

and country towns, finance for small factories to stimulate rural industries and
loans for assistance to tourism in the rural parts of development areas.
Within the general arrangements for promoting industrial expansion and
modernisation, smaller firms, which account for about one-fifth of manu¬
facturing output and about one-third of employment, have recently received
more government attention. In the Department of Industry there is a minister
with special responsibility for the small firms sector and a separate division
responsible for the development, inter-departmental co-ordination and im¬
plementation of policy towards small firms and for the administration of the
official services provided for them. The most important of these is the network
of ten small firms information centres in the regions, which work in co-opera¬
tion with Chambers of Commerce, trade associations and other organisations
and are linked with a central data bank in London in order to guide small
firms towards appropriate sources of information and assistance.
The following is a broad summary of the locational distribution of British
industry, grouped according to the eight standard regions of England, plus
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
London is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, and is probably
still the world’s most important financial centre. Lying at the head of ocean
navigation on the Thames estuary it is one of the world’s largest cities and
largest ports, though much deep-sea-going traffic has moved down-river to
Tilbury docks. It is the main centre in Britain of printing and the manufac¬
ture of clothing, food and drink, furniture, materials for the arts, precision
instruments and many other specialised products. Small firms predominate in
many of these industries and the average size of manufacturing firms (parti¬
cularly in the central area) is well below the national average. London is also
important, especially in its outer ring, for light engineering, chemicals and
consumer goods and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of
leading research establishments. There has been in recent years, however, a
considerable drop in employment in manufacturing industry in London, due
mainly to increasing shortages of labour and the rising cost of land.
Towards the periphery of Greater London (estimated population yjZSi.ooo)1
and in the surrounding Outer Metropolitan Area, industry, particularly the
electronics and consumer goods industries, has expanded greatly; some of the
largest aircraft plants are in these areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield,
as well as two of the four main motor vehicle manufacturers at Dagenham,
Luton and Dunstable. There are other major motor vehicle manufacturing
plants at Cowley, Oxford (population 114,200), some 50 miles north-west of
London. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there are large oil
refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering works and major
concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Southampton (population
212,000) consists of built-up areas, which from Brighton (160,300) eastwards
are partly dormitories for people working in London. Holiday resorts fringe
the coast. Portsmouth (200,400) is a naval port with some shipbuilding and
general manufactures. Southampton is Britain’s largest port for ocean-going
liners; its industries include ship repairing, oil refining, cable-making,
1 Because of the reorganisation of local government population figures are not available
for all the places mentioned in this section. Many of the population figures are also much
larger than previously, as they refer to the larger local government districts.

electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover (102,400), Folkestone and Newhaven
are ferry ports.
Though famous for its tourism, leisure industries and agriculture, the south¬
west of England has a busy manufacturing sector. In the Camborne, Redruth,
Falmouth and St. Austell areas, Cornwall has china clay and tin mining, and
machinery manufacture, ship repairing and other forms of engineering.
Plymouth (249,800) with the naval dockyard and electrical and other industries,
is an important manufacturing centre. The towns of Gloucester (90,600),
Cheltenham (86,200) and Bath (85,300) are major producers of machinery,
instrumentation and other engineering products. Swindon (90,700) has vehicle,
electrical and electronic engineering. Clothing, footwear, and other textile
products are made at several centres. Bristol (421,800), the region’s admini¬
strative and commercial centre, is a leading port and the largest industrial
city, having food processing, tobacco, packaging materials, printing, aerospace,
machinery and a wide range of other industries; there are extensive modern
docks at Avonmouth, an industrialised suburb with important basic chemicals
and non-ferrous metal plants.
Although the smallest of the regions East Anglia has been rapidly growing in
terms of both population and employment. A major contribution to this growth
has been made by the nine towns receiving overspill of population and industry
from London. The area is one of the most productive agricultural regions in
the world and this has provided a firm base for the growth of the food pro¬
cessing industry, which is concerned mainly with canning, and more recently
freezing, of local produce. Cambridge (103,700) is a leading centre of research-
based industry; Ipswich (122,700) and Peterborough (109,000) are noted for
diesel engines, agricultural machinery and engineering generally; and Norwich
(120,000) for footwear and food manufacture. The east coast ports of Great
Yarmouth (75,800) and Lowestoft have become important bases for companies
associated with oil and natural gas exploitation in the North Sea.
The main concentration of industry in the West Midlands is in the conurba¬
tion which includes Birmingham (1,087,600), Wolverhampton (269,500),
Dudley (297,800), Walsall (271,800), and Solihull (198,700) and in Coventry
(336,000). The economy of the conurbation and Coventry is dominated by the
metal-using industries, in particular by motor vehicle manufacture which itself
draws substantially from the mechanical and electrical engineering industries.
Other notable industries include jewellery, rubber products, chemicals and
domestic metalware.
The manufacture of pottery and china is the most important industry in the
smaller conurbation of north Staffordshire centred upon Stoke on Trent
(260,100). Other manufactures such as rubber and electrical products have
developed in the area in recent years, but coalmining has contracted.
Other industrial centres include Stafford (113,200), heavy electrical and
other engineering; Worcester (74,100), engineering; Burton on Trent, brewing
and rubber; Kidderminster, carpets; and Rugby (87,700), electrical engineer¬
ing. Stratford-upon-Avon (98,400), the birthplace of William Shakespeare, is
an important tourist centre.
The industrial cities and towns of the East Midlands include Leicester
(287,500), noted for hosiery and knitwear, boots and shoes and machinery for
making these products; Derby (217,900) for general engineering, aero-engines
and man-made fibres; Nottingham (294,700) for hosiery, cycles and a variety
of other engineering products, lace, pharmaceutical products and tobacco;

Northampton (135,800), footwear and engineering; and Chesterfield (95,500),
engineering. Northampton was designated a new town in 1968. Corby (53,600),
a new town in Northamptonshire, has a large integrated steel works. Part of
Britain’s richest and most highly mechanised coalfield lies under the north¬
east of the area. Some of the towns on the coalfield, such as Mansfield (96,700),
have important manufacturing industries, particularly textiles. Lincoln
(73,300) is noted as an engineering centre.
The North-West comprises the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester
(2*7 million) and Merseyside (1 -6 million) and the counties of Lancashire (1-4
million) and Cheshire (0-9 million). Manchester (530,800) is Britain’s second
most important commercial and financial centre and a major port. It is the
commercial hub of the textile industry and one of the chief industrial centres
for electrical and heavy engineering and for the production of a wide range of
goods including machine tools, petrochemicals, dyestuffs, and pharmaceuticals.
The traditional cotton-manufacturing towns circling Manchester, while adapt¬
ing to the increasing use of man-made fibres, have seen engineering outgrow
the textile industry. The largest towns are Bolton (261,300), Stockport
(294,700), Oldham (225,400), Blackburn (141,800), Preston (132,800), Roch¬
dale (208,000) and Bury (178,700), which have diversified into printing, paper
making, textile and electrical machinery and heavy commercial vehicles
(Chorley-Leyland area). The ten remaining Lancashire coal mines lie in South
Lancashire, but employ only about 10,000 people.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of export
traffic, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington,
(163,800) with its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes, Runcorn
with the chemical industry, and Ellesmere Port (82,000) with its oil refinery
installations, before reaching the Mersey estuary. St. Helens (192,100), to the
north of the canal, is famous for glass manufacture. Liverpool (575,000) is
one of Britain’s leading seaports and, after London, the largest centre for
processing imported foodstuffs and raw materials (flour milling, soap, sugar
refining and rubber products). While it has grown to be a significant service
centre its industrial strengths have changed from the older industries such as
shipbuilding and repair across the river at Birkenhead (135,800) to the newer
industries, including electrical engineering, heavy industrial plant and motor
vehicles.
The North-West has international airports at Manchester (Ringway) and
Liverpool (Speke) and a well-developed rail and motorway system, which not
only links the conurbations to the more northerly industrial towns and the
local tourist resorts such as Blackpool (150,900), but also provides access to the
rest of the country and to Europe. There are also four new towns in the region
Yorkshire and Humberside (total population 4-9 million) is centrally placed in
Britain and is served by advanced road and rail communications. Though
some parts are heavily industrialised, more than four-fifths of the region is
open country, including the Yorkshire Dales, the Yorkshire Moors National
Parks and part of the Peak District.
The region’s industrial structure is diverse. Important industries include
textiles, mechanical engineering, metals and metal goods, coalmining, food¬
processing, drink, clothing, vehicle components, chemicals and glass con¬
tainers. About 70 per cent of Britain’s worsted and woollen industry is located
in West Yorkshire. Bradford (463,000) is the commercial centre of the wool
trade. The metropolitan district of Leeds (746,400) includes about half a
million people in the city of Leeds, which is an important commercial centre
212
Northern England
Wales
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and also has a variety of industries including men’s clothing and various
engineering industries. In the south, the steel centre based on Sheffield and
Rotherham is noted for high-quality steels, tools and cutlery. Yorkshire’s coal¬
field is particularly important and production is to be extended to the Selby
area, where major new reserves have been discovered. The main centres in the
coalfield (Doncaster and Barnsley) are well positioned in relation to com¬
munications, particularly to motorways, which makes them natural growth
points.
York, a leading tourist attraction, is also noted for chocolate and confection¬
ery manufacture. It is an important railway centre and has substantial railway
workshops. Humberside, with four ports, offers varied trading outlets to over¬
seas markets, particularly to Europe. Kingston-upon-Hull, the other principal
city in the region (283,200), has, in addition to port activity, industries engaged
in engineering, vegetable oil-processing, chemicals, sawmilling and food¬
processing. The ports of Grimsby, Immingham, and Goole, the steel town of
Scunthorpe, and a variety of industries, including oil-refining, on Humberside
are of importance. The completion of the Humber Bridge in 1977 should
further assist the region’s development.
The greater part of this region (the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear
and the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria) is an
area of hills, lakes and moorland and is relatively thinly populated. Most of the
population is concentrated in the eastern coastal strip stretching from the
coalfields north of the Tyne to the Tees. Within this area the main centres are
Newcastle upon Tyne (299,800), Sunderland (295,200), Stockton (162,600)
and Hartlepool (99,400). The main towns of Cumbria are Carlisle (99,800) and
Barrow-in-Furness (75,500).
The whole region is relatively more dependent than other parts of England
on the long-established heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel
manufacture, shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of
chemical plants on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in
Europe), which together employ about one-quarter of the male workers.
Europe’s largest steelmaking complex is being developed in the Teesside area.
At the same time other types of industry have been successfully established in
the region. It is one of the most important areas for the manufacture of
electrical plant, and the many other industries include mining machinery,
rolling mill plant, earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes, paint, glass,
clothing and scientific instruments. An aluminium smelter is operating on
the Northumberland coast. Atomic energy is important in Cumbria, with two
nuclear power stations and other installations.
Nearly two-thirds of the population (which totals 2*7 million) live in industrial
South Wales. Coalmining remains a major industry; although the numbers
employed have declined substantially, the area still produces virtually all
Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and other specialised coals. There
are plans for the further rationalisation and modernisation of steel, the other
traditional industry of South Wales, which already supplies all of Britain’s
output of tinplate and much of its sheet steel. In the past 35 years many new
industries, including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor vehicle
components, plastics, chemicals and textiles have been established throughout
the former coalmining valleys and on the coastal plain. Cardiff (285,800),
Newport (135,900) and Swansea (190,400) are the major urban centres and,
with Barry and Port Talbot, are also the major ports of the region, the latter
with one of Britain’s largest steelmaking plants and a new, deepwater harbour

for importing iron ore. Inland the main concentrations of population are
Rhondda (87,700) and Merthyr Tydfil (61,500), the largest centres in the
coalmining area.
The other main industrial area is in North Wales. Here also coalmining
has declined, but the sheet steel, chemical and man-made fibre industries are
important employers. In addition, and particularly in the Wrexham (106,800)
area, newer light industries, including domestic electrical appliances, have
been introduced and on Deeside there is a large aircraft manufacturing plant.
The remainder of Wales is predominantly rural, and sparsely populated,
although light industry has been introduced in many areas. Milford Haven
(14,000) is one of the finest natural deepwater harbours in the world and has
developed as Britain’s major oil importing port. It has four major oil refineries
and also an ocean terminal which links it with Wales’ fifth refinery at Llandarcy
near Swansea. These five refineries together account for more than one-quarter
of Britain’s total capacity. Offshore, in the Celtic Sea, there is increasing
interest in exploration for oil and gas. Wales as a whole is important as a
holiday and recreational centre.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population of 5-2 million is concentrated in
the central Lowlands between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The
principal cities in this area are Glasgow (835,600), a major commercial centre,
and Edinburgh (448,700), Scotland’s capital, an administrative and cultural
centre. Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is a major shipbuilding and marine
engineering centre; it produces a great variety of general engineering products
and is also an important centre for food, drink and tobacco manufactures. The
steel industry, sited mainly in north Lanarkshire, produces a wide range of
products. The widely dispersed electronics equipment industry is represented
by a growing number of firms in such centres as Glasgow, north Lanarkshire,
Dundee and central Fife, as well as in Edinburgh, where this and other modern
industries are expanding alongside the long-established engineering, printing
and brewing industries. Large-scale plants producing cars in Renfrewshire
and commercial vehicles in West Lothian are now well established, while
heavy earth-moving equipment and tracked vehicles are produced in north
Lanarkshire. The Firth of Clyde provides central Scotland with valuable
deepwater facilities.
Outside the central Lowland belt there is considerable industrial concen¬
tration in and around Dundee (180,700) and Aberdeen (180,800) and a number
of towns outside these areas have attracted light industries in recent years.
Dundee’s traditional manufacture, jute, has been supplemented by office
machinery, clocks and watches, refrigerators and electronic products.
North-east Scotland has the largest concentration of whisky distilleries,
while the paper industry and food and fish processing are also important. The
major oil discoveries in the North Sea (see p. 261) have led to many oil-related
projects being set up in the region: Aberdeen in particular has become a major
oil centre.
Most of northern Scotland is mountainous and much of southern Scotland
is hilly and rugged. These regions are sparsely populated, but the Scottish
Highlands possess significant resources of hydro-electric power (see p. 269).
There are high-quality tweed and knitwear industries both in the valley towns
of the Borders and in the Highlands and Islands. Small engineering and
electronics industries have recently been established in towns in the Borders
and the south-west. Small-scale manufacturing has also been introduced in the
Highlands, and larger enterprises include the experimental and prototype fast

nuclear reactor at Dounreay and the aluminium smelter at Invergorden. There
is also large-scale development in oil-related industries—particularly the con¬
struction of oil production platforms—in the Moray Firth and Cromarty Firth
areas.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small and lacking in
minerals, there is substantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and
around Belfast, the capital city (362,000). Britain’s largest single shipyard
incorporating the world’s biggest shipbuilding berth is in Belfast; other well-
established activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile machinery and
other engineering products, ropes, twine, tobacco and clothing. Northern
Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles—it is particularly
well known for linen. The textile industry is, however, extensively diversified;
Northern Ireland is one of the most important areas in Europe for man-made
fibre production. There has also been extensive development in vehicle com¬
ponents, oil-well equipment, electronic instruments, telecommunications
equipment, shoes, carpets and synthetic rubber.
Industrial production as a whole (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, con¬
struction, and gas, electricity and water) was in 1973 some 7 per cent higher
than a year previously, 10 per cent higher than in 1970 and more than double
the level in 1948. For manufacturing industry the increase in 1973 was 8 per
cent; since 1970 manufacturing production has grown by 10 per cent and since
1948 by more than 130 per cent.

Among manufacturing industries output rose fastest between 1963 and 1973
in chemicals and allied industries (93 per cent), in coal and petroleum products
(71 per cent) and in engineering (59 per cent, comprising mechanical engineer¬
ing 42 per cent; instrument engineering 77 per cent; and electrical engineering
81 per cent). In the period 1970-73 output grew fastest in chemicals and allied
industries (21 per cent), engineering (12 per cent, the fastest growing sector

being electrical engineering 26 per cent), timber, furniture, etc. (30 per cent)
and bricks, pottery, glass, etc. (26 per cent).
The size of the labour force employed in industry has fallen steadily in the last
six or seven years and substantially in the period 1970-73. The increases in
production have been due mainly to a variety of factors influencing produc¬
tivity, including advances in products, machinery, processes and methods of
work; the rate of fixed capital formation; more intensive competition and sales
promotion; and improved management. Output per head (a basic measure of
labour productivity) increased by 15 per cent in production industries as a
whole in the period 1970-73, the increase for manufacturing industry being
17 per cent.

Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity depend most
directly on the decisions of individual undertakings. However, government
departments and educational and research establishments also make an im¬
portant contribution. The Department of Industry is responsible for the co¬
ordination of activities related to the improvement of industrial productivity.
It is represented on the EDCs (see p. 203) which are concerned with the
removal of obstacles to efficiency. The department also works to forward the
introduction of advanced machinery and techniques into industry, provides
technical advisory services and sponsors the Computer Aided Design Centre
and the National Computing Centre. It is concerned directly with research
into such factors as productivity measurement techniques, group technology
and production engineering. The Department of Employment advises firms
on aspects of productivity connected with manpower utilisation and industrial
relations.
Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance
and support schemes of vocational education and training, as do many trade
unions. The British Productivity Council is one of many specialist institutions,
both public and private, concerned with various aspects of productivity. The
council gives primary attention to manufacturing industry through a national
network of more than 60 local associations and provides information and
advisory services, seminars, conferences and courses, inter-firm visits and
industrial films among its services.

Investment
Management
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Productivity is particularly dependent on the quantity and efficiency of the
capital assets which the labour force has at its disposal. Investment in manu¬
facturing industry tends to reflect the level of demand in the economy as a
whole, with some time lag between the start of an increase in output and the
implementation of investment plans. There is thus a marked cyclical pattern
in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry, and since 1961 there have
been three discernible cycles. Investment fell from a peak in the third quarter
of 1961 to a low point at the beginning of 1963, then rose to a new peak in early
1966. It then fell again in 1967 before rising to a new peak at the end of 1970,
when the present cycle began. Details of investment in the period 1965-73 are
contained in Table 16. In 1973 fixed capital expenditure in manufacturing
industry (at 1970 prices) totalled £1,920 million, a 6-5 per cent increase on the
previous year. Analysed by industry group, investment in the food, drink and
tobacco group was £286 million, an increase of over 7 per cent on the pre¬
vious year; coal and petroleum products totalled £68 million; chemicals
£216-5 million; metal manufacture £223 million; engineering, shipbuilding
and metal goods £467 million (an increase of 30 per cent); vehicles £124
million (24 per cent); textiles, leather and clothing £170 million (37 per cent);
paper, printing and publishing £110 million (7 per cent); and other manu¬
facturing industries £256 million (12-5 per cent).
Of the 1973 total some £1,469 million (77 per cent) represented investment
in plant and machinery. Part of this rising investment is associated with the
introduction of new techniques and equipment and in particular of machines
and instruments which lessen the demand for human supervision, though they
may require more skill from fewer people. This process of automation is giving
rise to far-reaching changes in the pattern and organisation of industry and has
already been responsible for substantial increases in production and efficiency
which, in the long run, are likely to be very large. Much investment, however,
still consists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more tradi¬
tional kind.

“ After allowing for expenditure brought forward into 1968 from 1969 to secure the
higher rate of investment grants, estimated at £51 million.
In Britain, as elsewhere, management is recognised as a subject requiring
special skills and training, as is reflected in the increased educational qualifica¬
tions of managerial recruits and in the spread of systematic education for
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
217
Design
management. The growing number of professional people working as manage¬
ment consultants—now about 6,500—and the use of the services of indepen¬
dent management selection firms in the appointment of senior staff are further
indications of the concern for improved management performance.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) is the central national manage¬
ment body, independent, non-political and non-profit-making. Its purpose is
to study and promote scientific management, including management education
and training, throughout industry, commerce and public administration. The
BIM receives an annual government grant of about £100,000 to help it expand
services to industry. The Industrial Society works to promote better use of
human resources; it advises members and conducts conferences and courses.
Management studies and education for management are expanding rapidly
in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher education (see
p. 159). Training courses for higher management are held at several univer¬
sities and colleges, including the Administrative Staff College, Henley-on-
Thames, and Ashridge College of Management, Berkhamsted. There are
graduate business schools in London and Manchester and in Scotland: more
than 20 universities now offer graduate management courses and 19 have
courses at undergraduate level. The Council of Industry for Management,
jointly sponsored by the CBI, the BIM and the Foundation for Management
Education, works to foster the development of business and management
education. The larger firms, especially those with wide responsibilities, often
provide general management courses for senior executives, and systems of
informal training within an organisation are numerous. There are also a
number of bodies concerned with specialised branches of management, for
example, the Institute of Personnel Management, the Institution of Works
Managers, the Institute of Office Management and the Institute of Marketing.
The improvement of industrial design is also recognised as an important factor.
The Design Council is sponsored by the Government with the purpose of
improving the design of goods manufactured by British industry. The council
receives an annual grant from the Department of Industry and members are
appointed by the Secretary of State. They include industrialists, engineers,
retailers, architects, designers, educationists and trade unionists. In Scotland
the council’s activities are guided by a separate Scottish committee whose
members are similarly appointed.
The council’s work in promoting good design takes a number of forms. The
council keeps in close contact with British industry through officers who
analyse and advise on design. A designer selection service for companies who
wish to contact experienced industrial designers is also operated.
Permanent displays of modern British consumer products are maintained at
the Design Centres in London, Glasgow and Cardiff. All products on display
in the Design Centres are drawn from Design Index, the council’s photo¬
graphic and sample record of some 10,000 current British products selected
by independent committees for their good design, safety and performance.
The Design Centres also mount special exhibitions on particular design
themes, and the council also helps manufacturers who wish to exhibit their
products overseas at trade fairs or special displays of British design. Manufac¬
turers of outstanding products in both the consumer and engineering indus¬
tries may receive one of a number of annual Design Council Awards. These
cover the consumer goods, engineering products and components, medical
equipment and motor vehicle industries.
In addition, the council organises a comprehensive programme of courses,
2l8
Standards
Statistics
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
conferences and seminars on design for various audiences and it also plays an
important part in promoting better design education. It publishes two monthly
magazines Design and Engineering and a range of books, leaflets and cata¬
logues, including a series of design guides for engineers and paperbacks on
design in the home. It also has a photographic slide library.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p. 399), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of designers engaged in
industry and commerce, and the Design and Industries Association, a volun¬
tary association of industrial companies, designers, and others interested in
the promotion of good design in industry. The Crafts Council of Great
Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are
all grant-aided and work to improve craft design and to promote closer rela¬
tions between craftsmen and industry.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
in respect of, among other things, quality, performance, dimensions, testing
methods and codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by
manufacturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies
the specification of requirements. The BSI is governed by a council consisting
of representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers, pro¬
fessional institutions and the larger government departments.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
The following sections describe individual manufacturing industries in more
detail. (For coal and petroleum products see Chapter 13.) Production figures
in Table 17 and on p. 214 show the relative importance of broad sectors of
manufacturing industry. Expansion has been particularly marked in those
industries using advanced technologies such as electronics, the newer branches
of mechanical engineering, instrument engineering, most sectors of the
chemical industry and man-made fibres. At the same time other long-
established industries, such as shipbuilding and marine engineering and
electrical engineering, have been undertaking continuing reorganisation, re¬
equipment and modernisation. A major stimulus has been provided by the
various needs of the offshore oil and gas industries.
The main source of statistical information on industrial topics is the Business
Monitor series produced by the Business Statistics Office of the Department of
Industry (see p. 44)> and compiled from returns made by firms in industry.
Monthly and quarterly Production Series Monitors cover some 150 manufac¬
turing industries and their products, with information on output and overseas
trade concerning over 5,000 commodities. Annual Census of Production
Reports give total industrial figures for production, capital expenditure, stocks,
wages, salaries and employment. Information is also available in a number of
other publications. The Overseas Trade Statistics of the United Kingdom
contain detailed information on overseas trade, the December issue carrying
cumulative totals for the whole calendar year. The five-yearly Census of
Distribution is published in special reports; and short-term statistics on service
and distributive trades appear in a separate series of Business Monitor. The
weekly publication Trade and Industry includes regular statistics and com¬
mentary on industrial output, investment, retail sales and overseas trade and

employment statistics are published in the monthly Department of Employment
Gazette. Many of the figures are brought together in summary form in the
Monthly Digest of Statistics and the Annual Abstract of Statistics.
In the subsequent sections, employment statistics refer to numbers in Great
Britain at June 1973, sales and output figures are taken from the latest available
Business Monitor and export figures from the Overseas Trade Statistics. Some
production figures are given in metric terms, where statistics for an industry
are normally published in this form. Conversion tables are on p. 457.
The metal manufacturing industries employ 517,600 people. Of these,
250,000 are in the iron and steel industry, and 87,800 in the manufacture of
iron castings, 53,900 in the manufacture of aluminium and aluminium alloys,
and 75,100 in the copper, brass and other base metal industries. Exports of
iron and steel products and non-ferrous metals in 1973 had an aggregate value
of ^971 million.
Britain, responsible for most of the early developments in iron and steel pro¬
duction, is today the world’s fifth largest steel producing nation. Output of
crude steel in 1973 totalled 26*6 million ingot tonnes, 5 per cent more than in

1972. Pig iron production in 1973 totalled 16 *8 million tonnes, while net
deliveries of finished steel amounted to 23-3 million tonnes in 1973. Exports of
iron and steel products (including iron castings) were worth ^437 million; the
United States (^74*5 million), Sweden (£27-2 million), the Irish Republic
(£21 million), Canada (£18-7 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany
(£17-4 million) were the main overseas buyers.
The Iron and Steel Act 1967 brought into public ownership 13 major steel
companies (together producing about 90 per cent of Britain’s crude steel and
employing some 70 per cent of the manpower in the industry) and created
the British Steel Corporation (BSC). The remaining privately owned com¬
panies are represented by the British Independent Steel Producers’ Associa¬
tion. The main producing districts are: Wales (32 per cent of total crude steel
output in 1973); Yorkshire and Humberside (24 per cent); Northern (17 per
cent); and Scotland (12 per cent). Wales concentrates mainly on the manu¬
facture of flat products, especially sheet steel and tinplate; the output of the
north-east coast and Scotland is predominantly of heavy steel products (plates,
sections and rails), but a wide strip mill for sheet production is also in opera¬
tion in Scotland. Production of special alloy and stainless steels is centred on
Sheffield, while Scunthorpe concentrates on heavy and medium products. The
emphasis in investment by the BSC has been on improving efficiency rather
than raising total capacity by phasing out old open-hearth furnaces in favour of
the lower cost basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) process. Between 1967 and
1973 steel production by the BOS process increased from 28 per cent of output
to 48 per cent; by electric furnaces from 14 per cent to 20 per cent, while the
share from older open-hearth processes fell from 58 per cent to 32 per cent.
Output per blast furnace has risen markedly in recent years through improve¬
ments in efficiency, such as better preparation of raw materials and improve¬
ments to blast furnace design. Total annual research and development
expenditure by the industry is about £15 million, most of which is incurred
by the BSC in its divisional and corporate laboratories.
The corporation has in hand a ten-year development programme for the
modernisation and expansion of its activities. Expansion will take place at five
existing sites—two in Wales at Llanwern and Port Talbot, one at Ravenscraig
in Scotland, one at Scunthorpe and one in the Teesside area where a new BOS
plant will be constructed and the existing Lackenby works expanded to create
one of the largest and most modern steelmaking complexes in Europe.
Development projects completed in the last few years include a large-scale
basic oxygen steelmaking plant and a deep-water harbour/ore terminal at Port
Talbot, and a basic oxygen steelmaking plant at Lackenby, Cleveland. A
major new steelmaking and finishing complex at Scunthorpe commenced
operations in 1973.
More than 900 firms are engaged in the production of iron castings, five em¬
ploying more than 2,000 people and responsible for more than a quarter of
total output. In 1973 output of castings (3-44 million tonnes) was 5 per cent
higher than in the previous year. The main users of iron castings are the motor
vehicle industry, accounting for nearly one-third of the total tonnage sold, the
general engineering industry, the manufacturers of pressure pipes and fittings,
the building and associated industries and the steel industry. Exports (included
in the total for iron and steel in the previous section) totalled £14*2 million in
1973-
Britain’s non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe. Output in 1973
included: aluminium, 251,760 tonnes of virgin metal and 210,000 tonnes of

secondary metal; refined copper, 76,800 tonnes of virgin copper and 116,400
tonnes of secondary metal; lead, 144,960 tonnes; and zinc, 83,880 tonnes of
slab metal. Britain is also a major producer of the newer specialised metals
including uranium, zirconium and beryllium for the nuclear energy industry;
niobium for aircraft production; and selenium, silicon, germanium and
tantalum for electronic apparatus.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres include
south Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth, where one of the world’s
largest zinc smelters with a capacity of 120,000 tonnes a year is operational.
Three major new aluminium smelters provide over half of Britain’s require¬
ments. Mining is confined to the relatively small-scale working of tin in
Cornwall. Firms are engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling,
extrusion and drawing and advanced techniques of powder metallurgy and
pressure diecasting are also employed. Scientific and technological research for
the industry as a whole is conducted by the British Non-Ferrous Metals
Research Association.
In 1973 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at £360 million.
Exports of silver, platinum and other metals of the platinum group totalled
^178 million. The main products exported, including alloys and semi-finished
products, were copper (£154 million), nickel (£73 -6 million), aluminium (£46*4
million), lead (^26-2 million), tin (£34-8 million) and zinc (^10 million). The
United States (£90*1 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (^68-4
million), and France (^36-7 million) were the largest purchasing countries.
Mechanical engineering, employing some 955,500 people, comprises a group
of industries including all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial
engines, mechanical handling equipment, construction equipment and indus¬
trial plant. The aggregate value of sales was over ^4,000 million in 1973. Exports
of non-electric machinery were valued at ^2,412 million in 1973.
There are over 560 firms, employing 27,800 people, in the agricultural
machinery industry, including six large firms employing well over 1,500
workers each. The industry produces all types of soil preparation and cultiva¬
tion machinery, harvesting, threshing, feed processing and milking machinery.
(For tractors see p. 227.) In 1973 sales were valued at ^104 million and
exports were worth £58 million; European Community countries form the
main overseas markets.
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry and the British
industry is, today, one of the most advanced in the world. Output ranges from
watchmakers’ lathes weighing a few pounds to boring machines weighing
hundreds of tons, and to numerically controlled machine tools for every type
of requirement, including systems for complete machining centres. Equip¬
ment using new electrical machining techniques is also widely produced.
The seven major groupings in the industry’s 600 or so firms provide over half
of total deliveries, although because of the high degree of specialisation small
firms are numerically predominant. Centred mainly in London, the Midlands,
Yorkshire and Lancashire, the industry employs about 67,500 people. The
Machine Tool Trades Association is the representative body of most manu¬
facturers and importers, and is responsible for the international machine tool
exhibition held in Britain every four years, the next being due in 1976. The
industry is also served by its own research body, the Machine Tool Industry
Research Association.

The pattern of machine tool production is highly cyclical; sales in 1973
were valued at £213 million, including numerically controlled tools worth
£14 million. Exports of metal working machine tools in 1973 had a value of
£84 million, and of the orders on hand at the end of 1973 (£203 million),
44 per cent were for export; the United States (^8-9 million), the Soviet Union
(^8-8 million), the Federal Republic of Germany million), France
(£6-3 million) and South Africa (£3 -9 million), were the main overseas markets
in 1973. Exports of other metal working machinery, including converters,
casting machines, rolling mills and welding and cutting machinery, totalled
£28 million.
Industrial pumps and valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are
vital components in many industrial processes particularly in the chemicals,
oil and electric power industries. The total work force is some 79,300 and
there are 470 companies of which 13 employ more than 1,000 people. In 1973
sales of pumps and valves were estimated at £206 million and those of air
and gas compressors and fluid power equipment at £64 million and £96
million respectively. Exports of all types of equipment totalled £152 million.
Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial internal combustion engines
and other prime movers. Sales (including parts) had a value of ^168*7 million
in 1973; export sales of industrial internal combustion engines (excluding
parts) were worth £55-7 million. Production is concentrated among the ten
large firms in the industry, and a total of 27,000 people are employed.
The textile machinery industry produces machines and accessories for the
manufacture and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of natural and
man-made fibres. Comprising about 500 firms, five of which account for about
one-third of total output, the industry has some 35,000 employees and is
situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Leicester and
Nottingham. In 1973, the industry’s sales totalled £198-8 million and exports
£166 million. Principal markets were the European Community (£38‘3
million), the United States (£26-9 million) and Commonwealth countries
(£21-3 million). Exports of sewing machines totalled a further £20-3 million.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
produced, including crawler tractors, motor graders, scrapers, trenchers, dozer
equipment, dumpers, excavators, and crushing, pulverising and screening
plant. Five large firms are responsible for more than a third of total output; the
labour force numbers 37,200.
The value of sales by the industry was £380-4 million in 1973. Exports
of construction and mining machinery totalled £127-8 million. France
(£12-3 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (£7-7 million) and Australia
(£5-6 million) are important markets.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment, which
extends from individual units and accessories to complete operating systems.
There are some 540 firms in the industry, the ten largest being responsible for
over a quarter of total output; the labour force totals 62,300. The value of
output in 1973 was some £389 million, the main products being cranes and
bridge transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists and powered
industrial trucks. Exports of mechanical handling equipment (including

industrial and works trucks) in 1973 were valued at £108-4 million, European
Community countries forming the largest market (£31-8 million).
The office machinery industry comprises some 100 firms, seven of which
account for about three-quarters of total output. British subsidiaries or asso¬
ciates of overseas firms are prominent in some sectors of the industry. There
are 28,900 people employed.
Sales have been expanding rapidly and in 1973 were valued at £130
million (including non-electronic data processing and handling equipment and
electronic calculators). Exports of all office machinery (excluding electronic
computers and data processing equipment, see p. 226) were valued at £77*2
million. The most important overseas purchasers were European Community
countries (£i4'6 million) and the United States (£17*6 million).
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including pro¬
cess) plant and steelwork. The industry, which comprises both equipment
manufacturers and contractors responsible for the design, engineering, con¬
struction and commissioning of complete plants for process industries, has
many large-scale enterprises, including nine with over 2,000 workers respon¬
sible for about one-quarter of total output, and in all employs 159,100 people.
For nuclear power station construction see Chapter 13. In 1973 the estimated
value of equipment sales was £623 million, of which £91 million was for
overseas markets. Of particular importance are chemical and oil refining
(process) plant, steam-raising boilers, sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces
and plant, lime and cement kilns, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treat¬
ment plant, and fabricated steelwork for bridges, buildings, and industrial
installations.
In 1973 sales of boilers and boilerhouse plant totalled £120-5 million;
exports totalled £23 -2 million. Water tube boilers of advanced design and of
large steam-raising capacity are produced for power stations, together with
shell boilers for steam-raising and heating in factories and other buildings.
Sales of fabricated iron and steelwork totalled £166-6 million in 1973 and
constructional steelwork £192-1 million; exports totalled £24 million and
£15-2 million respectively. A wide range of other industrial plant is also pro¬
duced including furnaces and kilns (£47-1 million), refuse disposal and other
plant (£36-3 million), and water, effluent and sewage treatment plant (£337
million). Exports amounted to £26-5 million in 1973.
The design, engineering, construction and commissioning of complete
process plants for the chemical, petrochemical, oil refining and gas industries
has expanded rapidly in recent years. There are some 30 process plant con¬
tracting groups in Britain, half of which are United States subsidiaries. In 1973
expenditure on complete process plants and constructional steelwork totalled
£315 million. British firms are carrying out major plant projects in many over¬
seas countries.
In addition to the mechanical engineering products described in the preceding
sections there are some 2,600 enterprises producing other types of machinery
and employing some 228,900 workers. The main products include: mining
machinery (sales worth £134-9 million in 1973); printing, bookbinding and
paper goods machinery (£84-7 million); non-domestic refrigerating machinery
(£64-1 million); space-heating, ventilating and air-conditioning equipment
(£192-5 million); food and drink processing machinery (£64-9 million);
packaging and bottling machinery (£51-8 million); scales and weighing

machinery (£20-2 million); portable power tools (£60*5 million); and
miscellaneous non-electrical machinery (some £382-5 million).
Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are about 5,100 enterprises, employing 186,000 people, whose main functions
are to supply parts and components and to undertake general sub-contracting,
fabricating and repair work. (Some enterprises are included because the mixed
character of their work precludes their classification under any single mechani¬
cal engineering group.) The sector includes 12 large undertakings with more
than 2,000 employees and responsible for about one-quarter of total output.
Ball, roller, needle and similar bearings and transmission and other precision
chains, are particularly important products. In 1973 sales of ball and other
bearings totalled £145-6 million and precision chains and other mechanical
engineering products £295-3 million. Exports of bearings totalled £36-7
million and chains and other mechanical engineering products £134-9 million.
With products extending from scientific and industrial instruments to photo¬
graphic equipment and timepieces, instrument engineering is a particularly
important sector of the engineering industry. Electronic techniques, parti¬
cularly in the industrial instrument sector, are of growing importance. Aggre¬
gate output was valued in 1973 at some £620 million and has increased, in
value terms, by 169 per cent since 1963. In all, some 159,300 people are
employed in this sector.
There are some 940 firms in the scientific and industrial instruments industry,
which has a labour force numbering 105,000. Twenty-one large firms, with
more than 1,000 employees, are responsible for over one-third of output. The
industry is represented by the Scientific Instruments Manufacturers Associa¬
tion (the Sira Institute conducts research on behalf of the industry). Output
of scientific instruments in 1973 totalled £402 million, including optical
instruments and appliances (£29-3 million), process measuring and control
instruments (£162 million) and electrical measuring and control instruments
(£52-4 million). Exports totalled £175*2 million.
Sales of photographic and cinematographic equipment (including document
copying machines) in 1973 totalled £89-4 million, and exports totalled £99
million.
There are some 70 firms in the watches and clocks industry, which employs
13,200 people; five relatively large employers are responsible for more than
half of total output. Deliveries in 1973 included watches and parts (£19-3
million), clocks and parts (£n-6 million) and time recorders (£1-5 million)
and the industry’s total sales were valued at £34-2 million; export sales,
including parts, were valued at £19-2 million.
With nearly 800 firms in the industry (five relatively large employers being
responsible for about one-sixth of output) deliveries of surgical instruments
and appliances and related products totalled £89-3 million in 1973; exports
totalled £42-2 million.
The electrical engineering industry, with a labour force of 795,300 is engaged
in the manufacture and installation of a wide variety of electrical and elec¬
tronic equipment, including all types of generating, transmission and dis¬
tribution equipment; motors; telecommunications and broadcasting apparatus,

television and radio receivers; computers; specialised electronic equipment;
and domestic electrical appliances. The total value of production in 1973 was
almost £4,200 million.
Exports of electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances (not including
electronics products such as computers, see p. 226) in 1973 were valued at
£807 million. Products are exported to all parts of the world; in 1973 the
Federal Republic of Germany (£52 million), South Africa (£49 million), the
United States (£47-6 million), France (£43"7 million) and Canada (£36-1
million) were among the principal markets.
The industry’s leading representative organisations are the British Electrical
and Allied Manufacturers’ Association and the Electronic Engineering Associ¬
ation; industry-wide scientific and technological research is carried out by the
Electrical Research Association.
British scientists and engineers were responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electric power and British
firms have continued to be important suppliers of machinery and equipment.
Although about 660 firms manufacture machinery mergers have led to the
creation of one of the leading electrical and electronic engineering groups in
Europe for generating, transmitting and distributing electric power, while a
number of smaller firms have been reorganised into larger units. Eight firms
with more than 2,000 employees are responsible for about one-third of total
output. The total labour force numbers 133,200.
In 1973 output of electrical machinery was valued at £635 million, including
£166 million worth of generating equipment, and £188 million worth of
switchgear and control gear. Exports of electric power machinery (generators,
motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers) amounted to £104*3 million in
1973. Switchgear, starting and control gear exports were valued at £34*9
million. The main purchasers were South Africa, Canada and Australia.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telecommunications networks and for many other purposes; its products
include submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials.
About half of the industry’s labour force of 42,100 are employed in four major
groups responsible for more than half of total output. The value of output
in 1973 was £411 million. Exports of insulated wire and cable and electrical
insulating equipment were worth £58*3 million; Commonwealth countries
are the largest purchasers.
Output of other electrical goods in 1973 included domestic electric appliances,
£362 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles and aircraft, £218
million; accumulators, £74 million; and electric lamps and light fittings,
£231*3 million. In terms of volume, sales included: 2 million electric
blankets, 1 *7 million domestic vacuum cleaners, 1 *2 million domestic washing
machines, 2*1 million electric irons and 3*2 million kettles. In 1973 exports of
domestic electrical equipment were valued at £69*8 million, including washing
machines and parts (£14*9 million), refrigerators and parts (£10 million) and
vacuum cleaners and parts (£15 million); the main markets were European
Community countries, particularly the Federal Republic of Germany, the
Netherlands and the Irish Republic. Exports of batteries and accumulators in
I973 were valued at £23*6 million, electric lamps and light fittings £72‘9
million, and electrical equipment for motor vehicles, cycles and aircraft £24*8
million. There are about 260 firms producing domestic electric appliances

(four large employers producing over one-third of output) and about 1,000
firms producing other electrical goods (three very large firms producing about
one-quarter of total output). The industry has a labour force of 201,200,
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding
industries in Britain. British scientists and companies have made a number of
important contributions to the industry’s technology. There are numerous
firms in the industry, although in most sectors—telecommunications, com¬
ponents, consumer goods, computers and communications and capital equip¬
ment—there are a few large-scale enterprises. Total deliveries in 1973 were
valued at over £2,100 million (not including electronic process control and
industrial instrumentation, see p. 224) and export deliveries at £600 million.
The industry employs some 418,800 people.
Only a part of the telecommunications industry is concerned with electronic
equipment, but it is normally considered as a sector of the electronics industry.
The degree of involvement in electronics is, however, increasing and will
continue to do so with the advent of new switching systems. Total sales of
telegraph and telephone apparatus were valued at £391‘8 million in 1973, in¬
cluding sales to the Post Office of £278 million. Britain is a major exporter
of telecommunications equipment, with overseas sales valued in 1973 at
£53 -3 million. Research and development work is done by firms in the industry,
in co-operation with the Post Office. The industry employs 88,300 people,
and three firms are responsible for almost all the output.
The components sector (in which there is a large number of firms) manu¬
factures the whole range of active and passive electronics components, in¬
cluding integrated circuits (in which many circuits are accommodated on a
single chip of silicon), mainly for the electronics equipment industry. Deli¬
veries of components in 1973 comprised active components valued at £158
million and passive components valued at £370 million: output of integrated
circuits totalled £28*7 million. Exports were valued at £191-6 million.
The consumer goods sector of the industry manufactures radio and tele¬
vision sets, radiograms, high fidelity audio equipment, tape recorders and
similar products. The industry is dominated by several large firms. The
sector’s output had a total value of £420-3 million in 1973; output included
3 million televisions, 1 million radios and 1 million radiograms and record
players. Exports were valued at £23 -4 million.
The computer sector manufactures complete ‘hardware’ and peripherals,
including mini-computers for use in control and automation systems and in
communications-related applications, providing in addition the full range of
associated services (‘software’). The sector is dominated by a number of large
concerns, including subsidiaries of overseas companies. Total output in 1973
was valued at £348-9 million and exports at £204-9 million.
The other major sector of the electronics industry manufactures radio
communications equipment, radar and navigational aids, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital equipment. Such British equipment is exten¬
sively used throughout the world. The sector’s total output in 1973 was valued
at £388-5 million, including radio communication equipment £72-9 million,
radar equipment £82-9 million and navigational aids £40-1 million. Exports
totalled £107-9 million.
The industries which manufacture vehicles and aircraft are a particularly
important source of overseas earnings; exports of transport equipment in 1973,
valued at £1,556 million, formed some 12-5 per cent of total exports. The

shipbuilding and marine engineering, 40,800 in the manufacture of loco¬
motives and railway wagons and carriages, 27,900 in wheeled tractor manu¬
facturing and 16,800 in the making of cycles and motor cycles.
The largest section of the vehicle industry comprises the manufacture of cars
and commercial vehicles. Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by
four large firms—the British Leyland Motor Corporation, Ford, Chrysler
United Kingdom and Vauxhall—which account for over 95 per cent of car
and commercial vehicle production; the remainder is in the hands of smaller,
specialist producers of heavy commercial vehicles, buses, coaches, limousines
and sports cars. At one time located mainly in the Midlands and the London
area, the industry, during the last decade, has built manufacturing and
assembly plants on Merseyside, in Wales and in Scotland. The principal trade
association is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which holds
a motor show annually in London and a commercial vehicle exhibition every
two years. The Motor Industry Research Association carries out collective
research on vehicles and components.
Output of passenger cars in 1973 totalled 1-747 million units, compared with
1-921 million in the previous year. Exports in 1973 amounted to 601,545 cars
valued at £376-6 million. The United States (£79*5 million) was the largest
single purchaser, followed by Belgium (£34-5 million), South Africa (£21-5
million), New Zealand (£19-3 million) and Iran (£18-8 million).
Production of commercial vehicles totalled 416,600 in 1973. Britain is one of
the world’s largest exporters of commercial vehicles. Exports in 1973 num¬
bered 147,700 worth £198-5 million. South Africa (£17-3 million), the Irish
Republic (£12-7 million), Nigeria (£9-3 million) and Australia (£7-9 million)
were the main markets.
Exports of bodies, chassis and parts for cars and commercial vehicles had a
value of some £504-4 million in 1973; internal combustion engines and parts
£94-5 million; and caravan and trailer exports totalled £38-3 million.
The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural tractors.
In addition to the major motor vehicle manufacturers, production is domi¬
nated by three large organisations. Some 119,300 agricultural and industrial
wheeled tractors were delivered in 1973. Exports of tractors were valued at
£163-5 million in 1973; Turkey (£11-5 million), Australia (£11-i million),
South Africa (£io-i million), Canada (£9 million) and the United States
(£8-7 million) were the major buyers.
Sales of motor cycles and parts amounted to £24-8 million in 1973. Manu¬
facture of motor cycles is dominated by one large group. Exports of motor
cycles and parts totalled £22-2 million in 1973, with the United States (£15
million) much the biggest market.
Deliveries of bicycles amounted in 1973 to 2 million. Most of British manu¬
facturing capacity is in the hands of a single group of companies concentrated
in the Nottingham area. Some 1-07 million cycles worth £19-3 million were
sent overseas in 1973; the United States (£9 million) was the largest single
market, followed by Nigeria (£3-5 million).

for industrial users and for export. Output in 1973 had a total value of ^159
million. The value of exports of railway vehicles and parts was £15’7 million;
Commonwealth countries were the largest purchasers.
Britain’s aerospace industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive in
the world, producing civil and military aircraft, helicopters, guided weapons,
hovercraft and space vehicles. The construction of aircraft is dominated by two
large airframe manufacturers and one helicopter concern; outside these groups
are a few important smaller companies and a large number of components and
systems suppliers. Almost all aero-engine manufacture is in the hands of
Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd., a publicly owned company to which the essential
assets of Rolls-Royce Ltd. were transferred in 1971. Besides extensive research
and development work by the industry itself, research on a substantial scale is
carried out by a number of government research establishments. The industry
is represented by the Society of British Aerospace Companies which, in addi¬
tion to the provision of other services, organises a major air-show and exhibi¬
tion at Farnborough, Hampshire, every two years.
Total sales of aerospace products and work done in 1973 were valued at
£1,002 million, including £278 million for aircraft and parts, £296 million for
engines and parts and some £65 million for guided weapons and parts. Sales
to final buyers were estimated at ^800 million. Exports had a total value of
£520 million, including ^246-7 million for aircraft and parts and £241-2
million for engines and parts. The leading markets in 1973 were the United
States (£162-2 million), France (£70-4 million) and the Federal Republic of
Germany (£45-1 million). Sales to the People’s Republic of China were also
prominent.
Current production includes such civil aircraft as the Hawker Siddeley
HS J48 and Trident, the BAC One-Eleven and the Sky van and Islander J Tri¬
slander light transports. The Anglo-French Concorde supersonic transport is
at an advanced stage: new projects include the Hawker Siddeley HS 146, a
quiet feeder-line aircraft and the Short’s SD3-30, an enlarged version of the
Skyvan. Military programmes include the unique Hawker Siddeley Harrier
vertical/short take-off and landing aircraft (which has achieved extensive
sales to the United States) and the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, a collabora¬
tive development by Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy,
together with a number of guided-missile projects. The industry is also exten¬
sively involved in space activities, including satellites for communications and
other purposes and a number of European collaborative programmes. Britain is
in addition the world’s leading producer of hovercraft, the Winchester (SRN6)
and Mountbatten (SRN4) classes having been sold extensively overseas.
British aero-engines are also in world-wide use, recent developments including
the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine for the Harrier and similar aircraft and the
advanced technology RB 211 ultra-quiet engine, an area of continuing
development by the industry.
Britain’s shipbuilding industry is one of the largest in the world. In the past
decade the major shipyards have embarked on extensive programmes of
reorganisation and modernisation, including the introduction of advanced,

operational—they account for more than nine-tenths by gross tonnage of the
industry’s merchant shipbuilding operations. In addition numerous yards
around the coast build smaller vessels such as naval ships, fishing and harbour
craft, and oilrig supply vessels, this being a particularly rapidly growing area
of activity. Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is
undertaken by the British Ship Research Association.
In 1973 completions of merchant ships of 100 gross tons and over totalled
137 vessels of 1,069 thousand gross tons and an estimated value of £230
million, of which 26 vessels of 327 thousand gross tons with an estimated
value of £61 million were for overseas registration. At the end of that year
orders were on hand for 375 ships of 7,265 thousand gross tons with an
estimated value of £1,402 million, of which 88 vessels of 1,093 thousand gross
tons and an estimated value of £251 million were for overseas registration.
Deliveries of pleasure craft were valued at £25 -3 million. Exports of ships and
boats had a total value of £1237 million in 1973.
Some of the larger shipbuilding firms also carry out repair work in addition
to a number of specialist ship repair firms. Ship repair, maintenance, con¬
version and refitting by the whole industry had a value of £193-4 million in
1973. A number of specialist firms construct and fit various types of marine
diesel engines, steam turbines and gas turbines. Completions and deliveries of
marine engines and machinery totalled £n8-6 million in 1973. Direct exports
of marine propulsion diesels had a value of £12'5 million.
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not already described
consists of a very large number of firms with a total labour force of 563,000
in 1973; the main groups are engineers’ small tools and gauges (64,000
persons), bolts, nuts and screws (39,300), wire and wire manufactures
(38,200), cans and metal boxes (28,300), jewellery, plate, and the refining of
precious metals (19,300), hand tools and implements (20,200), cutlery (14,400),
and other metal industries (339,100). The total value of exports in 1973 was
about £400 million.
The manufacture of engineers’ small tools (used with metal-working machine
tools) and gauges is an expanding industry. Small firms predominate. Sales
totalled £184 million in 1973, including jigs and fixtures (£16 million), press
tools and moulds (£41 million), hard metal-tipped tools (£21 million) and
other metal cutting tools (£63 million). Exports totalled £48 million.
The production of cutlery and tableware (including safety razors and blades)
is centred mainly in Sheffield and the Midlands. The industry’s reputation has
been built on the skill of its craftsmen, although, except in the case of the
highest quality wares, mass-production methods are extensively used. Al¬
though small firms predominate, six relatively large employers are responsible
for over half of output. The value of sales of cutlery in 1973 was £13 million
and of safety razors and blades £25 million. Exports of cutlery, razors and
razor blades totalled £26-1 million.
About 250 firms produce a wide range of domestic utensils, such as saucepans,
buckets and dustbins, mainly from aluminium and wrought steel, together
with industrial hollow-ware such as kegs, drums and barrels. The value of
sales in 1973 was £102 million, of which £8 million were sales for export.
The manufacture of hand tools, such as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades,
is a long-established industry. There are about 350 firms, seven relatively large

employers being responsible for about one-third of output. Sheffield, Bir¬
mingham and other Midland towns are the most important centres. The value
of sales of hand tools and implements was ^69-3 million in 1973: exports
totalled £30-2 million.
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are world renowned. Most
firms in the industry, which is mainly centred on Birmingham, are small,
although four relatively large firms are responsible for three-fifths of total
output. The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths’ and silversmiths’
wares, including coins and medals, and electro-plated nickel silver wares in
I973 was j£94 milli°nJ °f which £14-9 million was for export.
The chemicals industry, with a labour force of 424,500 comprises the manu¬
facture of: general chemicals (134,800 employees), pharmaceutical chemicals
and preparations (74,200), toilet preparations (26,200), paint (26,800), soap
and detergents (14,900), synthetic resins, plastics materials and synthetic
rubber (46,600), dyestuffs and pigments (21,800), fertilisers (10,700), and other
chemical products (68,600). This is one of the fastest growing sectors of
British industry, and an important contributor to overseas earnings. The value
of exports in 1973 was £1,272 million, or 10 per cent of total British exports.
About one-third of the output of the general chemicals industry consists of a
limited number of relatively simple inorganic chemicals, such as sulphuric
acid and metallic and non-metallic oxides, produced in very large quantities
and serving as basic materials for industry. Substantial quantities of inorganic
chemicals are used in the manufacture of such products as fertilisers, deter¬
gents, paint, glass and metals. Sulphuric acid has the largest production of any
chemical and 3-9 million tonnes were produced in 1973. The remaining output
of this sector consists of a very wide range of chemicals of varying complexity.
The chemical industry is highly capital intensive, so that employment figures
for firms do not adequately reflect the size of undertakings. Four large firms are
responsible for almost half of total output of inorganic chemicals.
Petroleum-based chemicals account for over four-fifths of the total output
of organic chemicals; deliveries of feedstock for the petroleum chemical plants
totalled 7 million tonnes in 1973. The most important products (by weight)
in 1973 were ethylene (1,246 thousand tonnes), propylene (641,000 tonnes)
and benzene (768,000 tonnes). The main outlets for organic chemicals are
plastics materials, solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made fibres and deter¬
gents. Three large firms are responsible for almost two-thirds of total output
of organic chemicals.
Output of general chemicals totalled £1,552 million in 1973, and exports
£522 million; European Community countries and the United States are the
principal purchasers.
Sales of radioisotopes from the Radiochemical Centre Ltd. in 1973 were
valued at over £9 million of which 69 per cent represented exports.
The whole range of drugs is produced in Britain, where many of the basic
products were discovered and developed. These include antibiotics, sulphona-
mides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics, vaccines,
sera and naturally occurring drugs.
Thirteen large firms are responsible for almost half of total output; several
of the larger pharmaceutical companies are subsidiaries of overseas firms.

In 1973 sales of pharmaceutical chemicals and preparations totalled £582
million. Exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products and goods totalled
£221 *2 million, of which £28-9 million worth were antibiotics. The largest
purchasers were the Irish Republic (^12*9 million), Japan (£11 million) and
Italy (£n'4 million).
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing sections of industry.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—
notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a wide
range of industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene (a material
used for toys, light mouldings and many consumer goods). One of the newer
thermoplastic materials is polypropylene, which can be fabricated as mould¬
ings, films and fibres. A new family of plastics materials reinforced with
carbon fibres is also in commercial production in Britain; they have up to three
times the strength but are only half the weight of steel. High styrene rubbers
for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil resistance is
required, are also in large-scale production, together with neoprene rubber.
There are about 250 firms in the industry; five large enterprises are respon¬
sible for about two-fifths of output. In 1973 sales of synthetic resin and plastics
materials totalled ^631-7 million; sales of synthetic rubber a further
million. Exports of synthetic resins and plastics materials totalled £225 *2 mil¬
lion, the main purchasers being Australia (£18-1 million), Sweden (£16*5
million), the Irish Republic (£16-1 million) and South Africa (£15’4 million).
Exports of synthetic rubber totalled -£34*3 million.
The development of artificial fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
British scientists. Production is dominated by three firms, together with a
number of firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal consti¬
tuents—nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium—and is almost entirely for the
domestic market. Sales of fertilisers were valued at £200-8 million in 1973.
The use of ammonium nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen), ammonium phosphate,
and urea (mostly 45 per cent nitrogen), is resulting in more concentrated
fertilisers. The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, was £i4-8 million
in 1973, European Community countries forming the largest market.
Notable discoveries by the British crop protection industry include the
insecticidal activity of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective hor¬
mone weed-killer, MCPA, and more recently Gramoxone, a non-residual
general herbicide. Three relatively large firms are responsible for more than a
third of total output. Sales of pesticides and allied products were valued at
£79-5 million in 1973; herbicides (£31-5 million) were the largest single cate¬
gory. Exports of insecticides, fungicides and disinfectants in 1973 totalled £42
million.
Manufacturers’ sales of paint and varnish during 1973 amounted to some
591-2 million litres (including 151-1 million litres of emulsion paint) valued at
£267 million. In recent years many improved techniques have been intro¬
duced, including new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments, non-drip,
quick-drying paints and paints needing only one application. About 340 firms
are involved in this sector, six relatively large firms being responsible for

almost half of total output. Britain is one of the largest exporters of paints in
the world; exports of pigments, paints, varnishes and related products in 1973
amounted to £68-i million.
Sales of toilet preparations totalled £240 million in 1973 and sales of soap and
detergents £222 million. About 220 firms, including three large enterprises,
are involved in the toilet preparations industry and about 190 in the soap and
detergents industry. Exports of perfumery and toilet preparations, soap and
associated products were valued at £73 -9 million.
Sales of other chemical products in 1973 included formulated adhesives (£60-i
million), printing ink (£46-1 million) and photographic chemical materials
(£122-5 million). Sales of polishes in 1973 were valued at £43 million, includ¬
ing floor and furniture polishes worth £12 million.
The boundaries between the various fibre-based sectors of the textile industry
have now become indistinct and considerable vertical integration has taken
place, connected with the rapidly developing technology of man-made fibres.
Large multi-fibre, multi-process groups have been formed, four of which
control the bulk of spinning and warp knitting. The industry’s main research
bodies are the Cotton, Silk and Man-made Fibres Research Association, the
Wool Industries Research Association, and the Hosiery and Allied Trades
Research Association.
The industry has a labour force of 555,000, half of whom are women;
35,700 are engaged in the production of man-made fibres, 61,700 in the spin¬
ning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made fibres, 48,800 in the weaving
of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 106,700 in the woollen and worsted
trades, 127,000 in hosiery and knitted goods, 51,400 in textile finishing and
43,000 in carpets. The total value of textile exports in 1973 was £589-6
million.
Much of the early development of man-made fibres took place in Britain.
Production is spread throughout the country with Northern Ireland of growing
importance. Large firms predominate in the industry. Two main types of man¬
made fibres are manufactured: those made from cellulose (such as rayon) and
those produced by fully synthetic processes from chemical substances (the
polyamides, such as nylon, the acrylics and the polyesters). Viscose rayon is
still the most widely used of all man-made fibres and is almost all made by a
single company and its subsidiaries. Several types of nylon are produced,
together with Terylene, a polyester fibre, invented in Britain during the second
world war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to blending with
wool. Acrylic fibres, including Courtelle (a British discovery) and Acrilan,
are of growing importance. Synthetic elastomerics or spandex fibres, which are
man-made textile fibres having inherent properties of stretch and recovery, are
also produced, together with another British development, melded or non-
woven fibres and fabrics. There has been a rapid expansion of output in recent
years. Output totalled 717,000 tonnes valued at £397-3 million in 1973, con¬
sisting of 453,800 tonnes of staple fibre and 263,600 tonnes of filament yarn.
Of the continuous filament yarn 133,283 tonnes were polyamide yarns. Output
of woven man-made fibre cloth totalled 539-4 million linear yards valued at
£158-9 million.
Exports of synthetic and artificial yarns had a value of £128-6 million in
1973, and synthetic and artificial fabrics £49*9 million. The Irish Republic

and Sweden (£11-3 million) are among the most important purchasers.
The British wool textile industry, important since medieval times, is one of the
largest in the world. There are two main branches—woollen and worsted and
in recent years an increasing amount of man-made fibre has been blended with
wool. The small or medium-sized business predominates, with only a few
large firms. While West Yorkshire is by far the most important producing area,
Scotland and the west of England remain famous as specialised producers of
high-quality cloth.
In 1973 sales of woollen and worsted products had a total value of £758'i
million. Output included 138 million kg. of wool, tops and related products
and 92 million kg. of woollen and mixed yarn. Deliveries of worsted and semi¬
worsted yarn amounted to 100 million kg. and of woven fabrics to 212 million
square yards of which woollen comprised 126 million square yards and worsted
86 million square yards. In addition, large, but declining, quantities of raw
wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain. Consumption of raw wool in 1973 was
137 million kg. Exports in 1973 included wool yarns (£37 million) and fabrics
(^91 *5 million). The main buyers of woollen and worsted fabrics were Japan
(£207 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (^6-5 million) and Canada
(j£6-4 million). Raw wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain) and other animal hair
and tops exported had a value of ^82-3 million.
Cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods industry and cotton piece-goods
its largest export during the nineteenth century. Increasing low-cost competi¬
tion has cut progressively into British markets but the industry has responded
with extensive reorganisation, modernisation and the introduction of new
techniques. Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the
county being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Output in 1973 consisted of: 203 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 204
million lb. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 181 million lb. of
doubled cotton yarn, 496 million linear yards of woven cotton cloth, and 539
million linear yards of man-made fibre and mixture cloth. In 1973 exports of
cotton yarn were worth £197 million, exports of woven cotton fabrics were
valued at £39-5 million, with the Irish Republic and Commonwealth coun¬
tries the most important markets.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small-scale
enterprises. Although widely distributed, the industry is centred in the east
Midlands, the north-west of England and in Scotland. Sales of hosiery and
other knitted goods totalled £524 million in 1973 including £208 million
worth of outerwear, £103 million worth of socks, tights and stockings and
^138 million worth of knitted fabrics. Exports of knitted or crocheted clothing
and accessories were valued at £70-1 million in 1973; the largest buyers were
the United States (£9 million), the Irish Republic (£57 million) and
Switzerland (^6 million). Exports of knitted and crocheted fabrics amounted
to £43-2 million.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland which concentrates on
yarns and the lighter types of fabrics, with most of the remainder in Scotland.
Northern Ireland manufacturers produced 21 million linear yards of cloth in
i973, while weavers in Britain delivered 33‘i million square yards, including
9-4 million square yards of sailcloth and canvas. Textile exports in 1973

included ^7-7 million worth of linen fabrics and ^5-2 million worth of flax
yarns and linen thread.
Jute products are manufactured on a large scale in the Dundee area; jute yarn
is used in the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and woven into fabrics
for a wide range of applications in the packaging, carpet, upholstery, building
and motor car industries. New uses for jute, as a plastics reinforcement for
example, have also been developed. In 1973 output included 54,833 tons of
jute yarn and 161 -4 million square yards of woven jute cloth. Total sales of the
main products of the jute industry were valued at £54*3 million including
exports of ^3*1 million.
Sales of finished lace goods amounted to ^20 million in 1973. The most
important lace product is manufactured on warp knitting machines, with
sales valued at ^87 million. Exports of principal products were worth £4-9
million in 1973.
In addition to the products mentioned above, British textile firms manufacture
a wide range of other goods, including many special yarns and fabrics, net,
household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and curtains, and carpets
and other floor coverings. Sales of floor coverings of linoleum, vinyl and other
synthetic materials were valued at nearly £107 million in 1973; just under one-
sixth was for export. The cordage industry is one of the largest in Europe.
Exports of ropes, cordage, nets and netting in 1973 were valued at £5-4
million.
Some 140 enterprises are engaged in the manufacture of carpets and rugs,
including six large groups. The principal manufacturing centres include
Kidderminster, Halifax and Bradford, Glasgow and Kilmarnock and several
towns in Northern Ireland. About one-quarter of the carpets produced (by
quantity) are made predominantly of wool and a growing proportion of tradi¬
tional woven carpets contain some man-made fibre. Total sales in 1973
amounted to some 193 million square yards worth about £360 million.
Almost two-thirds of output is accounted for by tufted carpets, in the produc¬
tion of which the pile, usually with a high man-made fibre content, is inserted
into a pre-woven backing; woven carpets, such as Axminster and Wilton, make
up most of the remainder of sales, and form the bulk of exports which totalled
^62-8 million in 1973.
There are 461,600 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear industries.
Some 332,200 are in the clothing industry, 85,400 in the footwear trade and
44,000 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture. The aggregate value of
their exports in 1973 was £2107 million.
The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe. The typical firm in the
industry is small, although there are some large firms employing mass-produc¬
tion methods on an extensive scale. The principal manufacturing centres are
London, Leeds and Manchester, but some firms are also situated on industrial
estates throughout the country. The Clothing Export Council, representing
some 220 companies, organises promotions for various sectors of the industry.
Exports of clothing in 1973, including knitted goods but excluding fur clothing,
were valued at j£i75-2 million; the Irish Republic (£20-6 million) was the
main purchaser.
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION 235
Leather Leather tanning and leather goods manufacturing is another of Britain’s long-
established industries.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and
the London area. All types of leather (including heavy types for industrial use)
and leather goods are produced. Collective research is carried out by the
British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association. In 1973 the industry’s
output totalled ^143 million; exports were valued at ^49 million. The United
States (j£io-5 million) is the largest single market, followed by Canada (£5-2
million).
Footwear The British footwear industry is among the largest in the world. There are
almost 600 firms in the industry, with three large firms being responsible for
about one-fifth of total output. Factories are located throughout Britain. Some
areas concentrate on production of particular types; for example, the Rossen-
dale valley region of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on
women’s and girls’ shoes. In 1973 manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 190
million pairs with a value of £343 -3 million. Exports of all types had a value of
.£35-6 million; the Irish Republic (£6-2 million), the United States (£3-8
million) and Canada (£3 million) were the largest markets.
FOOD, DRINK The food, drink and tobacco industries employ 728,100 people in the pro-
AND TOBACCO duction of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports in
1973 was £8i6-8 million. Exports of alcoholic and other beverages accounted
for £305 million; sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £61-5 million;
cereal and cereal preparations for £54-6 million; fruit and vegetables for £43-3
million; and coffee, cocoa, tea and spices for £61-4 million.
Many of the industry’s leading firms have been involved in mergers in
recent years.
Bread The trend in bread production is towards concentrating production in large
mechanised bakeries most of them using a British process developed by the
industry’s main research organisation (the Flour Milling and Baking Research
Association) now also widely used in other countries. About two-thirds of
bread is made in these bakeries, which specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves
and mass production of flour confectionery. Three groups have a dominant
position. In the smaller bakeries production of cakes and other flour confec¬
tionery is usually allied to bread production. There are 118,600 employees in
the bread and flour confectionery industry and a further 23,300 in grain¬
milling. Output of bread totalled 2*26 million tons in 1973; sales of bread,
flour confectionery and other bakery products had a total value of £569-6
million.
There are 44,000 employees producing biscuits and related products. Out¬
put of biscuits totalled 610,000 tons in 1973; sales of biscuits and related
products had a total value of £229 million. British biscuits have gained a
world-wide reputation, and exports in 1973 were valued at £17-8 million.
Confectionery The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has 74,200
employees, is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and
many medium-sized and small firms. The main ingredients used by the
industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose, milk, nuts and fats. Production of
cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery and related products totalled 924,000
tons in 1973, with a total value of £472-3 million. An estimated 30 per cent of

total world exports of chocolate and sugar confectionery come from Britain,
the world’s largest exporter of these products; exports totalled £55‘2 million
in 1973.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen and dried fruit and vege¬
tables, jam, marmalade and pickles. The labour force numbers 58,400. Output
of jams and marmalade totalled 181,000 tons in 1973- Raspberry, straw¬
berry, apricot and blackcurrant jams are the most popular. Exports of jams
and marmalade in 1973 were valued at £2-9 million. In 1973, 775,000 tons of
canned vegetables were produced. Beans in tomato sauce (293,000 tons in
1973) and processed and fresh peas (248,000 tons) are the vegetables most in
demand as canned products. In addition, output in 1973 included 74,000 tons
of canned and bottled fruit. Strawberries, rhubarb and plums account for a
large part of the canned fruits, followed by prunes, gooseberries and fruit
salad. Sales of prepared fruit pie fillings are increasing. Nearly 321,000 tons of
vegetables were processed by quick freezing in 1973.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and pre¬
serving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the pre¬
paration of extracts and pastes. The labour force numbers 111,000. Output of
canned meat and canned meat products in 1973 totalled 151,000 tons, and the
quantity of bacon and ham cured was 245,000 tons. Quick-frozen fish output
amounted to some 118,000 tons in 1973; small quantities (7,400 tons in 1973)
are also canned. Exports of fish and fish preparations had a value of £43-1
million in 1973 and those of meat and meat products were worth £80 million.
The industries producing beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks have a
labour force of 127,300.
Exports of whisky (almost all of it Scotch whisky) totalled 78 million proof
gallons with a value of £260 million in 1973 > almost half went to the United
States which imported £113‘3 million worth of distilled alcoholic beverages
from Britain in 1973. Scotch whisky was first distilled in the fifteenth century.
It is blended from 20 or more different types, some from malted barley and
some from other grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the
Scotch whisky produced in the 1973 distilling year will not be on sale for some
years. Stocks of whisky amount to more than 600 million proof gallons,
representing 10 years’ consumption. About four-fifths of annual sales are to
overseas buyers.
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s. The main
distillers are in London and one company accounts for a large proportion of
total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad,
exports had a value of £15-8 million in 1973.
There are 67,900 employees in the brewing and malting industry. There are
seven major brewery groups which market their products throughout the
country together with a number of smaller enterprises. Firms have introduced
new production methods, including continuous brewing processes, and auto¬
mated batch production plants are well established. In 1973, 37 million bulk
barrels of beer were produced. Exports in 1973 of malt beer were 450,789 bulk
barrels, worth £6-7 million.
The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all

or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers and malt extract manufacturers. British
malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1973 amounted
to 122,800 tons, worth £7-6 million.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. Total
exports of non-alcoholic beverages were ^2-5 million in 1973. There are two
very large firms among about 20 producing widely advertised brands which
are marketed on a national scale together with about 250 firms supplying
regional markets. There is also some degree of specialisation by firms in the
production of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks,
squashes and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted drinks (in
which the whole fruit is used). Sales in 1973 included 84 million gallons of
concentrated soft drinks, and 356 million gallons of unconcentrated drinks.
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other tobacco
goods sold in Britain. The main centres of production are in and around Bris¬
tol, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and
Belfast. The two biggest manufacturing groups account for over 90 per cent
of total output and the industry has 33,200 employees. In 1973 the industry’s
total sales were valued at ^1,623 million. Exports worth £58-i million (of
which cigarettes accounted for nearly 90 per cent) were shipped to a large
number of overseas markets; Saudi Arabia (£7’4 million), the Netherlands
(£7-4 million) and Belgium (£4*1 million) being the most important. The
tobacco industry used 328*1 million lb. of imported tobacco in 1973, the main
sources being the United States, Canada and India. The industry’s output in¬
cluded 280*6 million lb. of cigarettes, including 223 *7 million lb. of tipped cigar¬
ettes ; 5 *4 million lb. of cigars; and 33 *5 million lb. of pipe and other tobacco.
This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 299,100 which includes 48,400 in
the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades, 73,100 in the glass industry
and 56,200 in the pottery industry.
Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, but most manufac¬
ture is now based on highly mechanised systems. In 1973 about 7,183 million
building bricks were produced in Great Britain, made mainly in the Bedford
and Peterborough areas. Sales of bricks and other non-refractory goods had a
total value of £171‘4 million in 1973. Refractory goods are manufactured
mainly for home use: output of firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks,
chrome-magnesite bricks and alumina bricks in 1973 totalled 932,870 tonnes
valued at £38 million and output of other refractory goods amounted to
£55*2 million.
The cement industry, with 14,500 employees, is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland cement for the home market. Invented by Joseph
Aspdin and patented in 1824, this material and the methods of its production
have been the subject of continuous technical improvement and intensive
research. The capacity of the industry has been expanded substantially in
recent years. Output totalled 20 million tonnes in 1973 and the industry’s
total sales were valued at £198*4 million.

The pottery industry, supplying almost all home needs for domestic and
industrial pottery, is a long-established industry, in which there has been
considerable re-equipment; kilns fired by gas or electricity have replaced
almost all the coal-fired kilns, and new decorating techniques and automatic
and semi-automatic machinery have been introduced. Domestic pottery,
including china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rockingham, accounts for
about half of the industry’s output; the other main divisions are glazed tiles,
sanitary ware and electrical ware, and such specialised industrial products as
acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics and laboratory porcelain are also
manufactured. Among famous makes of British pottery are Wedgwood, Spode,
Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby.
Total sales of pottery were £167 million in 1973 including export sales of ^60
million; the United States and Canada are among the leading markets.
Britain’s glass industry is one of the largest in the world. The section of the
industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various
forms is organised for quantity production, much of it in the form of ‘float’
glass (the process for the manufacture of which was developed in Britain and
perhaps the most marked advance in the history of glass-making) has been
licensed to glass makers throughout the world. The use of glass for internal
decoration and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased
in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor and
other industries. Other products include tubular glass (produced on a large
scale), mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass
fibres, and all types of glass containers (mostly made automatically). A tradi¬
tional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very high quality.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried out by the Department of
Glass Technology of Sheffield University.
Total sales of glass and glass products were valued at £341 million in 1973.
Direct exports of glass and glassware totalled ^64-8 million in 1973. Those of
glass were worth £39-2 million, the most important markets being European
Community countries. The figure included £13-5 million of float glass.
The paper, printing and publishing industries have 567,700 employees,
including 68,700 in the manufacture of paper and board, 85,200 in the pro¬
duction of packaging materials, 138,100 in the printing and publishing of
newspapers and periodicals, and 212,300 in other types of printing and
publishing.
The British paper and board industry is one of the largest in Europe. There
are a few very large groups in the industry and many medium-sized and small
firms. The large groups hold considerable interests abroad, including pulp and
paper producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts of the
Commonwealth and Europe. Research is undertaken by The Research Associa¬
tion for the Paper and Board, Printing and Packaging Industries.
The main raw materials are woodpulp and waste paper. Woodpulp pro¬
duced in Britain is of increasing importance although it still represents only a
small percentage of total supplies. Salvaged waste paper is of increasing
importance, and a number of new techniques for its use are being developed.
Total sales in 1973 of all types of paper and board amounted to £638
million. Of this, newsprint accounted for £38*5 million and other printing
and writing papers for ^238-4 million; £129-2 million was board and the
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION

remainder was made up chiefly of wrapping papers, industrial and special
purpose papers and tissues. Sales of household paper products, including facial
tissues, and other paper and board products totalled £191-9 million. Sales of
packaging products, such as cardboard boxes, cartons and fibreboard packing
cases, totalled £424-2 million, while sales of manufactured stationery were
valued at £241-6 million. Sales of wall coverings (where a major innovation
has been the introduction of plastics coated coverings) totalled £71 million.
Exports of paper and board reached a new record level of £87-7 million in
1973 and exports of manufactured paper items were valued at £41*1 million.
The Irish Republic (£11'7 million), France (£9-3 million), the Federal
Republic of Germany (£8-9 million) and the Netherlands (£6-3 million) are
among the leading purchasers.
Printing and The printing and publishing industry produces an immense range of goods,
Publishing from national newspapers and periodicals to books, business stationery and
greetings cards. Mergers in recent years have led to the formation of large
groups in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sections. Three large
firms each employ more than 15,000 people. General printing, publishing,
engraving and bookbinding remains essentially an industry of small firms.
Production processes include the latest developments in high-speed printing
equipment, including electronic engraving and advanced processes of photo¬
graphic reproduction, and several newspapers are set by computer techniques.
Total sales and receipts of newspapers and periodicals were valued at £992
million in 1973, including £597-4 million for newspapers (sales £229-1
million, advertising revenue £367-7 million) and £259 million for periodicals
(sales £131-9 million, advertising revenue £127-1 million). Sales in the
general printing and publishing industry totalled £845-6 million, of which
sales of books totalled £228 million. Exports of printed matter were valued
at £136-8 million in 1973, including books and pamphlets (£76 million),
and newspapers and periodicals (£21-4 million), but these figures do not
include parcel post shipments, which are possibly as large again as the recorded
totals. The United States (£25-2 million), Australia (£18-8 million) and the
Netherlands (£7-5 million) are among the most important overseas markets.
The Book Development Council of the Publishers’ Association promotes the
supply and use of British books overseas.
OTHER Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
IMnS^URING 286,500 employees, rubber manufacture, with 116,400 employees, and a group
of miscellaneous manufactures employs some 227,800 including 122,200 in
plastics moulding and fabricating.
Rubber Tyres and tubes represent more than half the output of the industry but firms
also make a variety of goods, the most important being rubber footwear,
conveyor belting, cables, hose, latex foam products and other vehicle com¬
ponents and accessories. One recent major development has been the intro¬
duction of tyre systems which enable the vehicle to continue safely after
puncturing. The largest tyre group in Europe came into being in 1971, follow¬
ing the merger of Britain’s leading rubber and tyre company and its Italian
equivalent. Tyre manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United States
and other overseas companies.
In 1973 the industry’s consumption of rubber totalled 443,600 tonnes,
comprising 161,500 tonnes of natural rubber, 264,100 tonnes of synthetic
rubber and 18,000 tonnes of recycled rubber. In 1973, 234,700 tonnes of

rubber were used in the production of tyres and tyre products. Direct exports
of rubber and rubber manufactures in 1973 were worth £121-2 million, with
Sweden, the United States and Australia as the main markets. This figure
included tyres and tubes valued at £68-4 million, but excluded large indirect
exports on vehicles. In addition, the industry exported about £6-3 million
worth of rubber or plastic footwear and £4-3 million of rubber gloves and
other clothing.
Numerous enterprises manufacture furniture in Britain (including domestic,
upholstered, office, school and other furniture) and the labour force is of the
order of 88,000. Sales of wooden furniture and upholstery totalled £507-1
million in 1973, while sales of metal furniture were valued at £110-3 million.
Exports of all furniture were worth £44-2 million in 1973. The bedding
industry employs 22,700 people; sales of bedding and soft furnishings in 1973
were valued at £108 million. Scientific research and technical and other
information services are provided by the Furniture Development Council and
the Furniture Industry Research Association.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain, and embraces highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units. The value of sales in
!973 was £39-4 million, of which £4-4 million was for export.
The timber industry employs 97,500 people. Britain is mainly dependent
on imported supplies of timber although domestic production has been
steadily increasing. Sales of timber, plywood and chipboard and builders’
woodwork totalled £605-2 million in 1973.
The number of people engaged in manufacturing toys and sports equipment
and children’s carriages in Britain is 43,400. Sales of toys, games and children’s
carriages in 1973 were worth £140-9 million and exports had a value of £46-3
million. The Federal Republic of Germany and the United States are the main
overseas markets. The value of sales of sports equipment was £41 -4 million:
exports totalled £18-5 million.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry, which accounts for about 7 per cent of the total
domestic income, includes firms engaged on the construction, alteration, repair
and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage and sewerage
systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, electrical wiring,
heating and other installation work, open-cast coal prospecting and mining,
and structural work connected with thermal and hydroelectric power stations
and telecommunications. About 1 -9 million people are engaged on construction,
including the self-employed, and they represent some 8 per cent of the em¬
ployed labour force. About 19 per cent are employed by public authorities.
Some 30 per cent of output consists of maintenance work, and about 44 per
cent of all new work is commissioned by public authorities.
Structure Constructional work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. About 80 per cent of the work is
done by private firms. Although there are over 66,000 firms employing two or
more people over 80 per cent of them employ fewer than 25 people.
Public authorities as a whole employ about 240,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these are engaged on repair and maintenance work which
local authorities, for example, carry out with their own labour.

Projects
Over 38 per cent of operatives are occupied on building maintenance, valued
at over £2,700 million annually. The total labour force includes about 700,000
skilled craftsmen, most of whom have been trained for four or five years under
the industry’s apprenticeship schemes. A further 81,000 are employed as
apprentices.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the
smallest projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either
by architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the constructional work by the contractor.
The Property Services Agency, which is an integral part of the Department
of the Environment (see p. 49) is responsible for the construction programmes
undertaken directly by the Government (except for health and education
projects), including work for the armed services, both at home and overseas.
The Department of the Environment is responsible for co-ordinating research
and development throughout the government service and seeks to influence
methods and techniques in the building industry as a whole.
The value of work done in 1973 amounted to £9,221 million, of which £829
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by
public authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £8,393 million
(£6,305 million on new work and £2,088 million on repair work).
Some 337,000 houses were started in 1973 and 304,000 were completed,
of which 191,000 were for private owners. Of the £2,464 million of new
housing carried out by private contractors, £1,656 million, or over half, was
for private owners and the remainder for public authorities. Industrialised
building methods employing prefabricated components are used in much of
the work.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Department of the Environment and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. Its main function is to
encourage the adoption of advanced methods of house building, and to provide
technical advice and services to government departments, local authorities and
other clients.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included John McAdam
pioneer in road construction; Thomas Telford, builder of roads, bridges,
canals, docks and railways; George and Robert Stephenson and Isambard
Kingdom Brunei, pioneers of railway building.
Among important construction projects in hand in Britain in 1974 were
several major conventional power stations and nuclear power stations (see p.
268), offshore production platforms for North Sea oil, hospitals, large-scale
housing developments, a scheme to extend the London underground railway
system to London Airport (Heathrow) and the first stage of the new Fleet
underground line across London. Projects for road construction, bridges and
tunnels included about 197 miles (317 kilometres) of motorways under con-

struction at the end of March 1974 in England alone (see p. 317), and a £26
million bridge across the river Humber (see p. 317).
Among important new construction projects being undertaken by British
contractors in overseas countries were: a £91 million dry dock and ship¬
repairing scheme and a £20 million cement works contract in Dubai; a £30
million contract for construction of three airfields in Zaire; a £2-5 million road
scheme in Nigeria; and a £23 million tower block project in Australia.
Recently the value of new overseas contracts obtained by British construction
firms, in a large number of different countries, has been running at about £350
million a year. A substantial and growing amount of overseas business is also
being done by British architects and surveyors, as well as by other types of
consultant. British members of the Association of Consulting Engineers had
projects worth about .£4,225 million in hand on 1st January 1974, bringing in
some £58 million net in invisible export earnings.
The Director-General of Research in the Department of the Environment
works closely with the building industry on many aspects of construction
research. The Building Research Establishment is concerned with all aspects of
building and provides a technical advisory service for construction firms. An
Agrement Board, set up by the Government, tests and certifies new products
and methods.
The construction industry is served by several of the industrial research
associations. The Construction Industry Research and Information Associa¬
tion is concerned with structural design, civil engineering construction, build¬
ing design and construction, earthworks and foundations, hydraulic and public
health engineering, and underwater engineering. The Heating and Ventilating
Research Association deals with heating and air-conditioning in dwellings and
commercial buildings. The application of materials is the main concern of the
Timber Research and Development Association and the Cement and Concrete
Association. Other research associations deal with bricks, paint, plastics in
building, welding and civil engineering hydraulics. The major construction
firms have research departments working on plant, materials and methods.
Other bodies concerned with research include the universities and colleges of
technology. Most of the producers of primary building materials have trade
associations which maintain research institutions chiefly devoted to seeking
new and more efficient use for their materials.
DISTRIBUTIVE AND SERVICE TRADES
Internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw materials,
capital goods and intermediate products (for example, vehicle components)
and trade in consumer goods, involving the network of distributive trades by
which home produced or imported goods reach the consumer. (For the pattern
of consumers’ expenditure, see p. 199.)
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and shoe repairers.
There have been a number of official statistical inquiries into the distributive
trades. The latest censuses taken in Great Britain refer to the wholesale trades
in 1965 and the retail and certain service trades in 1971. Sample monthly and
annual inquiries are also undertaken.
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
243
WHOLESALE
TRADE
RETAIL TRADE
Types of
Retailers
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers:
sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling organisations
(including their own retail outlets and mail order businesses); and other sales
are made directly by producers to retailers. The 1965 inquiry into wholesale
trades showed that a total of 23,643 business units were engaged in wholesale
distribution in Great Britain; 3,435 dealt in clothing, footwear and textiles,
2,007 in grocery and provisions, 2,630 in vegetables and fruit, and 3,469 in
other food and in drink. In addition, there were 8,282 dealers (wholesale or
retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or agricultural supplies, and 9,117
dealers in other industrial materials and machinery. The book value of stocks
held by wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1973 was £2,478 million; fixed
capital expenditure by wholesale distributors amounted to £181 million in
I973 (valued at 1970 prices).
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly, is
sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold by growers to commission agents (who dispose of the
produce either to wholesalers or direct to retailers) or the grower may deal
only with wholesale firms. The sale of some agricultural products is regulated
by statutory marketing boards (see p. 292).
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of food¬
stuffs, particularly imported supplies. Every year Covent Garden (see p. 293)
handles over 1 million tons of fruit and vegetables, and about 200,000 tons of
carcase meat and 53,000 tons of poultry pass through Smithfield market;
Billingsgate is the principal distributing centre for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
organisation to serve the needs of retail societies. The sales of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS), whose membership is restricted to incorporated
organisations, amounted to £775 million in 1973. This includes some sales by
the Scottish Co-operative Society before it merged with the CWS in June 1973.
Since the early 1950s, many wholesalers have joined, either singly or in
groups, with numbers of retailers to form voluntary groups to help to preserve
the existence of retail outlets for the wholesaler and to give to smaller retailers
the advantages of the lower costs of large-scale trading without significant loss
of independence. The 1966 Census of Distribution showed that about 41 per
cent of the turnover of independent grocers was attributable to wholesaler-
sponsored voluntary groups and chains. About 28,000 shops, nearly a quarter
of all independent grocers, are members of voluntary groups.
The number of Cash and Carry wholesale warehouses has increased in recent
years. By bulk purchasing and limiting their expenditure on premises or credit
and delivery facilities they can offer large price discounts to their customers.
There are about 600 stores of this type with total sales of over £900 million a
year. Cash and Carry wholesalers account for about half of all grocery ware¬
housing by turnover.
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under four main headings: (1)
multiple traders with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies;
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches); and (4) department
stores. Other retail outlets include gas and electricity showrooms and mail
order houses (see p. 246).
Provisional results of the 1971 Census of Distribution covering retail and
244 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
certain service trades in Great Britain indicate a continuation of the trend for
a larger volume of trade to be handled by rather fewer shops, particularly in
the food sector, along with the continuing expansion of large multiple firms
relative to other types of shop (Table 18). Independent shops account for about
half of the value of Britain’s retail trade, although they make up more than four-
fifths of the number of shops.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. Four
shops had sales in 1966 exceeding £10 million (equivalent to takings of more
than £4,000 an hour). At the other extreme there were more than 16,000 shops
with sales of less than £1,000 a year. In addition there were market and street
traders, whose volume of business may be very small.
Fixed capital expenditure by retail distributors in 1973 amounted to £408
million (at 1970 prices), an increase of 10 per cent over 1972.
Multiples and According to the provisional results of the 1971 Census of Distribution there
Large Establish- were over 67,000 shops owned by multiples (including multiple department
ments stores) in 1971 with a total turnover of over £6,000 million. In 1966 there had
been nearly 74,000 shops with sales of just under £4,000 million. The fall in
numbers, combined with the increase in sales, reflects the trend for individual
shops to become larger and handle a greater volume of sales. In 1971 the
multiples’ share of total turnover was about 40 per cent, compared with 34*5
per cent in 1966.
Retail The share in total retail turnover of co-operative stores dropped from 11 to 9
Co-operative per cent between 1961 and 1966 and fell again between 1966 and 1971 when it
Societies was 7 per cent. Their share of sales from food shops was 12 per cent compared
with 18 per cent in 1961 and 15 per cent in 1966. Total sales of the retail co¬
operative societies in 1971 amounted to about £1,100 million.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled by
their members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit on a
minimum share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other
members in the society. Share investment by individual members is limited
to £1,000 (less in some societies) and only a low rate of interest is normally
paid on the shares. One large society has introduced a scheme of bonus shares
carrying a higher rate of interest than the ordinary shares.
Traditionally the trading surplus was paid out to members in the form of a
dividend in proportion to their purchases. Recently a large number of societies,
accounting for over four-fifths of total co-operative sales, have introduced
dividend stamps redeemable for cash, other goods, or credit to a share account,
at different redemption rates.
In March 1974 there were about 239 retail co-operative societies. Amal¬
gamations are rapidly diminishing the number of societies (the total in 1958
was 1,015). The largest single society in Britain is Co-operative Retail Services
Limited with a turnover of £167 million in 1973.
Independent Shops Independent shops have been giving ground gradually in the face of increased
competition from the larger undertakings. The number of independent shops
fell by about 9 per cent between 1961 and 1966, but the decline has been partly
reduced by the existence of voluntary buying groups (see p. 243) and between
1966 and 1971 there was little change in numbers. Although the independent
shops’ share of trade continued to fall—to 53 per cent—they continue to play
an important role, often in terms of convenience, service, and range of goods
stocked. The proprietors of some smaller shops have other means of livelihood.
Department Stores Department stores were defined for the purposes of the census as having 25 or

more persons engaged in selling a wide range of commodities, notably clothing
and household goods.
There were 914 department stores in Britain in 1971 with a turnover of
£938 million; 296 were owned by multiples; 369 by independents; and 249,
with a turnover of ^156 million, by co-operative societies. Between 1966 and
1971 sales by department stores rose by some 44 per cent.
Out of a total of some 485,000 establishments recorded by the 1971 Census
of Distribution, and shown in Table 18, grocery and other food retailing
groups numbered nearly 202,000 establishments and the clothing and foot¬
wear group over 81,000.
Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (inclusive of elec¬
tricity and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by nearly 37 per cent
between 1966 and 1971, rates of growth (measured in turnover) varied appre¬
ciably between different types of trade. The slowest growth was in confec¬
tionery, tobacconist, newsagent, clothing and ‘other food’ sectors. The fastest
growth was in department stores, mail order business, gas and electricity
showroom sales, household goods, groceries and provisions, and ‘other non¬
foods’. However, the actual trends are blurred by the introduction into special¬
ised shops of other specialities, for example, clothing multiples opening food
sections, and vice versa. Though gas and electricity showroom business has
been buoyant in recent years, their combined turnover is relatively small,
amounting in 1971 to £283 million.
The expansion in the value of all retail sales in Great Britain between 1971
and 1973, when they were valued at over £20,000 million, was about 27 per
cent. Taking into account the general increase in prices over this period, the
real expansion of sales by all kinds of retail businesses between 1971 and 1973
was 11 per cent.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Northern Ireland 1965 Census of Retail Distribution and Other Ser¬
vices shows total sales of ^385 million through 22,000 establishments. The
value increased by 53 per cent between 1965 and 1973 to reach an estimated
figure of ^589 million.
The development of self-service trading has been a feature of the last two
decades. In 1971 there were over 28,000 stores operating wholly or partly
on self-service lines, compared with about 9,500 towards the end of 1961 and
less than 500 in 1950. This development has been accompanied by a trend to
larger shops in terms of both floor space and staff, though the number of staff
per square foot of floor space has not necessarily increased.
Supermarkets are defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling area
of 2,000 square feet. There were about 870 supermarkets in 1961, according
to the Census of Distribution; by 1971 it was estimated that there were some
4,800, handling nearly one-third of all retail food.
New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since 1955.
About 400,000 machines are in use. Organisations operating automatic
vending machines (not otherwise engaged in retail trade) numbered 60 in
1971, and sales from machines totalled nearly fn million. In 1966 the turn¬
over consisted of ffi million on sales of cigarettes and tobacco, fz million on
confectionery, £2-5 million on hot and cold beverages and £0-5 million on
prepared foodstuffs and other commodities.
Some 24,300 mobile shops and market stalls were reported in the Census of
Distribution for 1971, with sales amounting to £98 million. Scotland (where
the density of population is lower than in England) accounted for nearly a
quarter of this turnover, compared with a tenth of all retail sales. Co-operative
societies accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against
16 per cent in ordinary food shops. Mobile shops were mainly concerned with
food sales; about two-fifths were travelling grocers, and greengrocers and
butchers each accounted for over one-fifth. Only a small proportion were non¬
food shops, and these specialised mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.
The number of very large stores, generally known as ‘hypermarkets’ or ‘super¬
stores’, is increasing. With over 50,000 square feet of selling space they
operate on supermarket lines but with a much wider range of goods. They
are generally associated with exclusive car-parking facilities and situated away
from established central shopping areas.
Forms of consumer sales promotion include reduced price offers, competi¬
tions, gift schemes, and stamp trading. Trading stamps are normally exchanged
for goods but, by law, have to be marked with a cash value and where their
aggregate value is ^0-25 or more, redeemed for cash on request.
The credit card is widely used in Britain. The. cards enable users to have
their signatures accepted on bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants.
The issuers, which include banks, then meet the bills and recover the money
from the card-holder through a single account presented periodically.
Mail order trading which was one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain between 1961 and 1966 slowed its growth rate between 1966 and
1971, although the increase in sales over that period was still strong (44 per
cent). Turnover was £619 million in 1971, when it accounted for nearly 4 per
cent of total retail sales.

Sales by the 25 manufacturing and importing companies which sell all their
products directly to consumers amounted to about £350 million in 1973.
About 2-1 million people were employed in trades offering a service directly
to the public in 1973.
There were over 120,000 establishments concerned with catering (defined to
include public houses, canteens and fish and chip shops, as well as licensed
hotels and restaurants) in 1969. There were 203 catering organisations and
over 18,000 industrial and office canteens. In addition, about 100,000 offices
and factories have installed coin-operated beverage and snack machines.
The value of total turnover of all caterers in 1973 was £3,750 million, an
increase of 48 per cent over the 1969 figure. Turnover of hotels and holiday
camps increased by 62 per cent to £660 million and that of public houses by
49 per cent to £2,010 million.
In 1971 there were over 8,000 laundry, launderette, dry cleaning and towel,
linen and overalls hiring organisations. Turnover in 1971 amounted to nearly
£200 million.
There were nearly 43,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain in 1967
with 51,000 establishments. Total turnover amounted to £4,234 million, of
which sales of new vehicles accounted for £1,510 million and sales of used
vehicles for £766 million. The value of sales of accessories, receipts from
repairs and servicing and sales of petrol and oil amounted to £1,958 million.
Between 1967 and 1973 the motor trades’ total turnover increased rapidly by
about 92 per cent and in 1973 was n per cent more than in 1972. Of the total
turnover of about £8,100 million in 1973, sales of new vehicles accounted for
some 40 per cent, sales of second-hand vehicles for 15 per cent and other sales
for the remainder.
The 1971 census recorded over 47,000 hairdressing establishments with a
total turnover of £165 million. About two-thirds of the number are ladies’
hairdressers.
In 1971 there were some 6,300 boot and shoe repair establishments, the
number having fallen by over a quarter since 1966; takings in 1971 were £25
million, slightly below the 1966 level.
Other establishments offering a service to the public include those of radio and
television rental companies (over 3,300 specialist shops), and about 14,800
licensed betting offices.
In Britain the expansion of self-service shops, the spread of branded and
standardised products, and developments in partly prepared foods, for
example, ready-washed vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have all been
major factors in the sweeping changes which have taken place in packaging
methods. Packaging products of paper and board remain the most extensively
used (turnover of some £769 million a year), the fastest growing sector being
paper sacks (£52 million in 1973). Other important materials are tinplate,
plastics and glass. New uses are being found for tinplate, especially in sales of
soft drinks and beer. The use of plastics continues to develop; annual sales of
polyethylene film and film products amount to 107,000 tons and 125,000 tons

respectively, while the annual sales of low-density polyethylene bottles has
risen to about 671 million, providing further competition for the traditional
glass bottle.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
as cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers,
has been greatly helped by instalment purchase. Total new credit extended in
1973 amounted to £2,873 million, over 15 per cent more than in 1972; about
half was advanced by finance companies and half by retailers.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1973 to £30*3
million.
About £874 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1973; as a proportion of the gross national product (1-4 per cent) and of con¬
sumer expenditure (2 per cent), it is about the same as it was ten years ago.
About £572 million was spent on display advertising and £213 million on
classified, financial and industrial advertising. Most of the advertising is carried
out by agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer re¬
search and other services; their representative organisation is the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising. The trade association for the whole industry,
including agencies, advertisers and media owners, is the Advertising Associa¬
tion. It was responsible for the setting up of the Advertising Standards
Authority, an independent body whose objective is the promotion and en¬
forcement of the highest standards of advertising, in particular through the
British Code of Advertising Practice.
Industry and commerce pay great attention to improving public understand¬
ing of their work and objectives. Public relations consultancy firms and the
public relations departments of advertising agencies provide general services,
apart from the increasing employment by industrial organisations and trade
associations of staff specialists in public relations. Their professional body,
founded in 1948, is The Institute of Public Relations which has members in
commerce, industry, the professions, national associations, and central and
local government.
There is in Britain a comprehensive system of legislation and machinery to
protect the consumer’s economic and other interests. The importance attached
to this is indicated by the establishment under the Fair Trading Act 1973 of
the office of Director General of Fair Trading, and in 1974 of a new Depart¬
ment of Prices and Consumer Protection (see p. 53). One of the main tasks of
the Director General is to keep consumer affairs continuously under review so
that any trading practices which adversely affect the consumer can be speedily
regulated or prohibited and thus to ensure that the protection provided by the
law is up to date. The Director General also has an important role in the con¬
text of competition policy (see p. 204). The Supply of Goods (Implied Terms)
Act 1973 guarantees the consumer’s basic rights in transactions for the pur¬
chase of goods—that is, that the goods correspond to description and are of
merchantable quality and fit for their purpose. The Consumer Credit Act 1974
provides comprehensive protection for the consumer in every type of credit
and hiring transaction and the Director General is responsible for enforcing
the law and for advising on any steps necessary to keep it up to date. Other
important legislation includes the Weights and Measures Acts 1878-1963
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
249
which establish a uniform system of weights and measures and provide protec¬
tion against short weight and short measure in commodities; the Food and
Drugs Acts 1955 and 1956 which control the purity, hygiene and description
of food; the Consumer Protection Acts 1961 and 1971 which empower the
Government to make regulations to ensure the safety of any class of goods;
and the Trade Descriptions Acts 1968 and 1972 which make it an offence to
describe goods inaccurately or make certain kinds of false statements about
services. In the main, this type of legislation is enforced by the Trading
Standards Departments and other branches of local government. Independent
consumer councils for each of the nationalised industries investigate consumer
complaints, while some trade associations in industry and commerce have
established codes of practice designed to protect the consumer and look into
complaints about member firms.
Where necessary consumers can gain legal redress through the simplified
procedure introduced in 1973 in the county courts (see p. 87). Steps are being
taken to ensure that information and advice are more readily available to
consumers throughout the country; this service is provided by the Citizens’
Advice Bureaux (see p. 120) or by consumer advice centres run by local
authorities.
In addition a number of private organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association with a membership of
over 600,000. The association conducts an extensive programme of comparative
testing of goods bought on the open market; its views and test reports are
published in a series of bulletins issued to members, the main monthly bulletin
being entitled Which?. The association also provides an advice service on
subscription. Work of this kind is also carried out by local groups, whose
representative body is the National Federation of Consumer Groups. Other
private consumer organisations include the Housewife’s Trust and the
Research Institute for Consumer Affairs.
13 Energy and
Natural Resources
Ownership of
Mineral Rights
About half of Britain’s energy requirement is supplied from domestic fuel
minerals (defined, for the purposes of this handbook, as coal, oil and natural
gas), and minerals in general make an important contribution to the economy.
The approximate value of minerals produced in 1973 was £1,486 million, of
which coal contributed 65 per cent and natural gas 8 per cent. The discovery
of commercial oil fields on the British Continental Shelf is likely to increase
the importance of domestically produced fuel minerals to the economy very
considerably. Over the past ten years the production of non-fuel minerals has
been increasing in terms of both value and quantity.
Water resources are sufficient for domestic and industrial requirements;
supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
partly from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Apart from gold, silver, petroleum, natural gas (which are owned by the
Crown) and coal, all minerals in Great Britain are privately owned. On Bri¬
tain’s Continental Shelf the right to exploit all minerals except coal is vested in
the Crown. The exclusive right to extract coal, or license others to do so, both
on land and under the sea, is vested in the National Coal Board. Normally,
ownership of minerals runs with the ownership of the land surface but in some
areas, particularly where mining has taken place, these rights have become
separated. Mining and quarrying, apart from coal, are usually carried out by
privately owned limited liability companies.
ENERGY
Four main primary sources of energy—petroleum, coal, natural gas and nuclear
power—are used in Britain, together with some water power; secondary sources
produced from these are electricity, town gas and coke. About half of all
primary energy consumed comes from indigenous sources. Coal, almost all of
it mined within the country, accounts for over 38 per cent of primary energy
consumption, the amount of coal used and its share of the total energy market
having risen in 1973 for the first time in recent years. Natural gas produced
from the British sector of the Continental Shelf under the North Sea accounted
for 11-5 per cent of the energy market in 1973, supplies from the North Sea
discoveries having expanded rapidly since natural gas was first piped ashore
in 1967. A programme for the establishment of nuclear power stations has been
in progress since 1955 and nuclear power now provides a significant share of
electricity supplies, although less than 3 per cent of total energy requirements.
Water power resources are very small. The share of oil—almost all of it
imported—in total energy consumption expanded rapidly from under 10 per
cent in 1950 to over 48 per cent in 1972, but fell slightly to some 46 per cent
in 1973. The first supplies of oil from the British sector of the North Sea are
expected by the end of 1974 and it is expected that North Sea oil will supply
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
251
ENERGY TRENDS 1963-1973
or even exceed Britain’s oil requirements by 1980, when almost all the energy
consumed in Britain could be derived from indigenous sources. Trends in
primary energy consumption are shown in Table 19 and in the diagram
above.
Inland consumption of energy reached a level of about 342 million tons of
coal equivalent in 1973, an increase of over 4 per cent over the 1972 figure. In
recent years a 1 per cent rise in gross domestic product has on average been
associated with a rise of about 0-7 per cent in energy consumption, which
illustrates the major importance of the energy sector in Britain’s economy.
Energy consumption by final users in 1973 amounted to some 61,000 million
therms on a ‘heat supplied’ basis. Industrial users consumed about 40 per cent
of the total, domestic users 25 per cent, transport—including road, rail, water
252
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and air transport—over 20 per cent, public services about 6 per cent and
agriculture nearly 1*5 per cent. Energy consumption figures for the main
industrial groups are given in Table 20.
TABLE 19: Inland Energy Consumption (in terms of primary sources)
Million tons coal equivalent
Source: United Kingdom Energy Statistics
a Consumption was depressed somewhat in the last quarter of 1973 by the reduction in
coal and oil supplies due respectively to the industrial dispute in the coal industry and
the cutback in oil supplies by producer countries.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of petroleum and the
extraction of natural gas, are under public ownership. In 1974 the Department
of Energy (see p. 48) was set up to assume general responsibility for the
effective and co-ordinated development of fuel and power resources in Great
Britain; in Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for
electricity. The Government’s energy policy has been to ensure the best use
of indigenous resources and so reduce the dependence on imported oil. The
importance of this approach was illustrated by the shortfall in oil supplies in
late 1973 and reinforced by the effect of increased oil prices in 1973-74 on
the balance of trade and the cost of living (see pp. 385 and 193).

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
253
COAL
The National
Coal Board
The nationalised fuel and power industries in Britain employ in total some
650,000 people, or 2*5 per cent of the working population; their capital invest¬
ment in 1973 was over £700 million; their annual turnover is about £4,000
million; and the value of their net output is about 4 per cent of the national
product. The nationalised industry boards’ investment is financed through
internal resources and borrowing from the Government (long term), the
clearing banks (short term), and from overseas sources (long term). Research
is undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using industries. The Secretary of State
for Energy also has an Advisory Council on Research and Development. An
Energy Technology Support Unit was set up in 1974 to help the Secretary of
State to assess the need for further research into non-nuclear forms of energy.
A Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee advises on nuclear safety issues and
a Nuclear Power Advisory Board advises on other nuclear power matters. In
each of the nationalised fuel industries there are statutory bodies set up to
protect the interests of consumers.
Following Britain’s entry into the European Community in January 1973
its fuel industries are co-operating to an increasing extent with those of the
other member countries. The coal industry now conforms to the rules of the
European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, see p. 77); under the arrange¬
ments for British accession to the ECSC tariff barriers between the coal
markets of Britain and the other members were removed on 1st January 1973.
Britain’s entry meant a doubling of the Community’s coal industry to a
combined annual production of some 266 million tons in 1973.
A Community energy policy is in the early stages of development with the
basic aim of guaranteeing certain and lasting energy supplies under satis¬
factory economic conditions.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. In 1913—the peak production year—the industry
produced 287 million tons of coal, exported 94 million tons and employed over
a million workers.
In 1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as
a statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The National Coal Board (NCB) consists of a chairman and between eight
and fourteen members appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy. The
NCB has, with minor exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of coal
in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work small
pits and open-cast sites. It has no monopoly in distribution, and retail sales
remain largely in private hands, although it makes bulk sales to large industrial
consumers.
Two holding companies, wholly owned by the NCB, came into operation in
April 1973, taking over the NCB’s non-mining activities. NCB (Ancillaries)
Limited took over responsibility for certain retail fuel distribution operations,
computer services, non-operational land and brickworks (the brickmaking
interests were disposed of in the course of 1973-74). NCB (Coal Products)
Limited took over responsibility for solid smokeless fuel manufacture,
chemical and by-products plants and North Sea exploration.
The NCB is responsible for the day-to-day running and the commercial
management of the industry, but is answerable to the Secretary of State (and
COAL
Consumption
Production and
Productivity
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES 255
through him, to Parliament) for its efficiency. The Secretary of State has power
to issue general directives on matters affecting the national interest, and to
authorise borrowings to finance capital investment.
At the end of March 1974 there were 259 NCB collieries in operation, each
on average producing some 375,ooo1 tons of coal, compared with 192,000 in
1947. Of these, 256 were grouped into 15 areas (reduced to 12 at the beginning
of 1974-75) each controlled by a director responsible to the NCB. The remain¬
ing three collieries (in Kent) are controlled by a general manager who is also
responsible to the NCB.
Total consumption of coal was over 121 million tons in the year ended March
1974, a decrease of 5-5 per cent over the previous year. This reduction
stemmed from fuel conservation measures introduced during a labour dispute
in the industry. Consumption in the previous year had been 131 million tons,
an increase of 8-5 per cent over 1971-72. This increase came after a period of
about 15 years during which coal consumption declined steadily. Between 1947
and 1956 coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of
nearly 4 million tons; sales fell sharply, however, between 1956 and 1959 and
the decline in demand continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.
Growing competition from oil, increasing efficiency in the use of coal and
reduced requirements of the gas, steel, railway transport and other industries
contributed to the fall in demand. The competitiveness of coal in the domestic
energy market has been improved by the greatly increased price of oil at the
end of 1973 (see p. 193).
Consumption by the electricity industry has increased by about 35 per cent
since i960 to 70-3 million tons in 1973-74 when the industry accounted for
about 57 per cent of total coal consumption. The requirements of most other
classes of consumer have declined. Coke ovens consume over 15 per cent but
only a further 19-9 per cent is consumed by industrial and domestic users
combined. Consumption by the gas industry has fallen rapidly to less than
0-3 per cent of the total. The fall in consumption of coal by domestic users has
been slightly offset by increased purchases of solid smokeless fuels.
Coal exports in 1973-74 were 2-i million tons, the largest customer being
the Federal Republic of Germany; almost all of the exports go to Western
European countries. In 1973 imports amounted to i-6 million tons.
Total output in 1973-74 was 107-2 million tons, a decrease of over 22 per cent
compared with 1972-73. The fall in demand during the 1950s and 1960s was
accompanied by increases in productivity in the industry and resulted in a
rundown of the labour force from some 700,000 to about 242,500 at the end of
1973-74, about 21,100 fewer workers than at the end of 1972-73. Productivity
as a whole has risen by over a half since 1961 to 2-1 tons per manshift in 1973-
74; at the coal face it has more than doubled over the last 20 years to 7-2 tons
per manshift in 1973-74. The increases have been obtained largely by con¬
centration on the more productive mines and faces, by increasing mechanisa¬
tion at the face, and by the use of multi-shift working. Mechanised faces
account for more than 90 per cent of output. About 90 per cent of all faces
are equipped with powered supports.

Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out due to the
early development of the industry, there are still abundant reserves estimated
at 160,000 million tons of which about 4,000 million tons were estimated to be
economically viable at the last assessment in 1973 and there is considerable
scope for opening up new collieries. A new mine is planned to exploit the
Selby coalfield in North Yorkshire where total reserves are estimated at 1,000
million tons. Exploration in the Selby area is part of a national programme to
prove new reserves either for the establishment of new mines or to extend
existing collieries as part of the NCB’s plan to maintain total output. There
are also development plans to exploit north-east England’s offshore coalfields.
The main coal-bearing areas are shown in the map on p. 254.
The NCB raises capital, including working capital, by borrowing from the
Secretary of State for Energy or with his consent and the approval of the
Treasury from overseas sources. Within certain limits the board may also,
with the permission of the Secretary of State for Energy, borrow temporarily
(by way of overdraft or otherwise). The greater proportion of investment is
financed from internal resources.
Under the Coal Industry Act 1973 some £450 million, being the NCB’s
accumulated deficit at the end of March 1973 together with the amount by
which the board’s capital assets were overvalued, was written off; the statu¬
tory limit on the NCB’s borrowing was set at £550 million in the first instance,
with provision for extension to £700 million if necessary and a limit of £50
million was imposed on the NCB’s accumulated deficit to be increased to £100
million if necessary. The Act also provided for government assistance to the
industry in the form of improved redundancy terms, contribution to better
pensions and various operational grants. In i973~74 these grants were: social

costs ^i2-7 million, contribution to increased pensions ^8-3 million, pro¬
motion of coal sales to generating boards £15*4 million, coking coal subsidies
^15 million, regional grants £75 million. However, in the year ending
March 1974 the NCB made an operating loss of about ^112 million following
the labour dispute in 1973-74. This deficit has been met by additional govern¬
ment grants.
A major investment programme is planned by the NCB, with government
support, to end the contraction of the coal industry. The programme, called
Plan for Coal, involves new capital investment of some £600 million over the
period to 1985 in order to provide 42 million tons of new capacity to replace
that lost by depletion. This investment is over and above the requirements of
some £70 million to £80 million a year for ordinary continuing capital
expenditure. The Government has given an assurance that short-term
fluctuations in the price and availability of competing fuels should not be
allowed to interfere with the implementation of the programme. The Govern¬
ment accepted the NCB’s plan after its adoption had been recommended in
the interim report of the tripartite examination (by the Government, NCB
and trade unions) of the future of the coal industry.
The NCB has two research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, concerned with the
processing and utilisation of coal; and a Mining Research and Development
Establishment, near Bretby, Derbyshire, for research on mining methods and
equipment, the underground environment and coal preparation. There are
also scientific control staff throughout the coalfields and a large operational
research organisation.
The NCB, with the British Steel Corporation and others, supports research
on carbonisation at the British Carbonisation Research Association. Much of
the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establishment
(SMRE), is closely related to the board’s problems; the SMRE carries out
research on explosions and fires, pneumoconiosis, engineering and metallurgy.
In 1973-74 the NCB spent £5 *2 million on research.
Seismic prospecting in the British sector of the North Sea for natural gas and
oil has been going on since the early 1960s and full-scale exploration activities
since 1964, following the enactment of the Continental Shelf Act 1964, and the
subsequent award of a first round of licences. Further licences were issued in
1965, 1970-71 and 1971-72. The total area now under licence is 42,234 square
miles (109,413 square kilometres) out of a total area, over which Britain has
exercised its rights to explore and exploit the seabed and subsoil, of 171,000
square miles (443,000 square kilometres).
Work on the development and production of natural gas and oil discovered
in the British sector of the North Sea is proceeding rapidly. By the end of 1973
342 exploration or appraisal wells and 198 production wells had been drilled;
of these 61 and 21 respectively were drilled in 1973. The total number of
drilling rigs used rose from 19 to 25 in 1973 and the maximum number of rigs
in use at any one time rose from 14 to 18. As a result of this high level of
activity five oilfields were declared commercial in 1973.
The first oil from the British sector of the North Sea is expected to be pro¬
duced by the end of 1974. Other fields are expected to start production in

first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and
Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In
the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting,
provided by a growing number of company and municipal undertakings. How¬
ever, between the two world wars it was displaced from this function by
electricity and it is now mainly used for heating purposes, supplying over
13*5 million customers. The discovery and subsequent use of natural gas was
preceded by a switch from coal-based to cheaper oil-based town gas.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
100,000 people are at present employed, under public ownership and control
in 1949. The industry’s structure was adapted under the Gas Act 1972 to take
account of the change from manufactured to natural gas necessitating more
centralised control of production and transmission. The British Gas Corpora¬
tion came into operation in 1973 taking the place of the Gas Council, the former
central co-ordinating body in the industry, and assuming the responsibilities
of the 12 area gas boards formerly carrying out the local manufacture and the
distribution of gas to consumers. Members of the corporation are appointed
by the Secretary of State for Energy. In connection with its main duty of
developing and maintaining an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system
of gas supply and of satisfying reasonable demands for gas, it has powers: to
search for and extract natural gas and to extract any petroleum discovered in
the course of searching for gas; to manufacture or acquire, transmit and dis¬
tribute gas; to manufacture, supply, or sell byproducts; and to manufacture,
install, maintain or remove gas plant and fittings.
A National Gas Consumers’ Council, and 12 Regional Gas Consumers’
Councils, are appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy to protect con¬
sumer interests.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
The main single source of gas in Britain is now natural gas, supplied either
directly (over 80 per cent) or as feedstock for town gas manufacture, and
accounting for about 90 per cent of total consumption. Between i960 and 1973
the quantity of gas available increased by about 450 per cent to reach a figure of
11,600 million therms.1
The first commercial gas discovery in the British sector of the North Sea
was made in 1965. Five major gasfields are now in production: Leman Bank,
West Sole, Hewett, Indefatigable and Viking. Two other fields, Rough and
Frigg, the large field which straddles the boundary between the British and
Norwegian sectors, are expected to come into production in 1975 and 1976
respectively. A number of smaller structures have also been found and explora¬
tion continues. Total proven gas reserves from British discoveries already made
amount to 27-8 million million cubic feet and total possible reserves amount
to 41 - 5 million million cubic feet.
The first pipeline to pump natural gas to the shore, at Easington in York¬
shire, was put on flow early in 1967. Since then further pipelines have been laid
to bring natural gas to the terminals at Bacton, Norfolk, and Theddlethorpe,
Lincolnshire.

amounted to 12,282 million therms, an increase of 1,284 million therms (12
per cent) over the previous year.
In 1973-74 quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was about
34 million therms, most of it for household use.
The pipeline system commissioned in 1964 for the delivery of liquefied
natural gas from Algeria has been expanded to form a national high-pressure
pipeline system for distribution of natural gas derived mainly from British
fields in the North Sea. By March 1974 some 2,239 miles (3,603 kilometres) of
pipeline were in operation. This virtually completed the system required for
handling natural gas from fields off the eastern coast of England. The central
distribution system is supplied by eight feeder mains from the three North
Sea shore terminals, and from the Canvey Island terminal for liquefied
Algerian gas.
Over half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation is for industrial and
commercial purposes and the remainder for household use. Total consump¬
tion increased steadily during the 1960s and then rapidly rose by over 84 per
cent between 1970 and 1973. Sales reached a level of 10,770 million therms in
1973-
Gas has traditionally been used extensively in industries which require the
control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery
industry and in certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products.
Natural gas not required by the fixed tariff domestic, commercial and small
industrial markets is being used as a chemical feedstock and in bulk fuel
markets. In 1973 sales of gas to industry totalled 4,832 million therms, 13 per
cent more than in 1972; sales to commercial users increased by nearly 9 per cent
to reach nearly 1,100 million therms.
About 45 per cent of the domestic load is used for central heating, with gas
fires and cookers accounting for a further 45 per cent. There are some 11
million gas cookers, 10 million space heaters, 3 million central heating installa¬
tions, over million water heaters, and over 1 million refrigerators. In 1973,
4,815 million therms were sold to domestic users.
The borrowing limit for the British Gas Corporation has been fixed by the
Gas Act 1972 at £2,500 million, to be raised by order if necessary up to
£2,700 million. Within this limit the corporation may borrow (long term)
from overseas sources.
The industry had been spending about £50 million a year on capital invest¬
ment in the period 1955 to 1961 but since 1961-62 expenditure has increased
sharply. Capital needs over the four years to March 1975 are estimated at over
£1,200 million, of which the largest items are £531 million on bulk trans¬
mission and distribution and £371 million on conversion to natural gas. About
half of the total is being met from internal resources.
The British Gas Corporation is constructing a terminal at St Fergus near
Peterhead in Scotland for the reception of gas from the Frigg field and a new
transmission pipeline will be laid to bring the gas into the national network.
First supplies are expected in 1976.
A phased programme of converting the 40 million gas appliances is in
progress. Some 75 per cent of consumers had had their appliances converted
at the end of March 1974. It is expected that the switch over to natural gas will

be completed by 1978. Investigations are being made into projects involving
various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions.
Liquefaction and storage facilities for natural gas have been constructed near
Coatbridge, Scotland, and other facilities are under construction or planned.
The British Gas Corporation has a research committee which advises on
research policy at four research centres. The engineering research station at
Killingworth, Northumberland, has concentrated on large-scale distribution
problems. Research is also done on behalf of the corporation at a number of
universities and colleges. Work is being carried out on processes for manu¬
facture of substitute natural gas, in which there is wide interest overseas,
especially in areas where natural gas is running short. The corporation’s total
expenditure on research, development and testing amounts to over £8 million
a year.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962. With the rapid growth of oil consumption during this
century, however, Britain has become almost totally dependent on imported
supplies. With the recent discoveries of oil in the British sector of the North
Sea Britain has the opportunity to reduce or even eliminate this dependence.
The first important find of oil in the British sector, the Forties field, was made
in 1970. Oil from the field, believed to be one of the largest in the world, is to
be brought ashore by a m-mile (177-kilometre) submarine pipeline. A
further nine commercial fields have been discovered and several other signi¬
ficant finds may prove to be commercial after further appraisal. First oil from
the British sector is expected to be brought ashore by tanker from the Argyll
field before the end of 1974. The Forties, Piper, Beryl and Auk fields are
expected to start production in 1975.
Latest government estimates indicate a production rate in 1980 of between
100 million and 140 million tons a year from existing fields and allowing for
further discoveries. Proven reserves of the commercial fields amount to 895
million tons but possible reserves from present and future finds under existing
licences total 2,950 million tons.
Annual production of crude oil (including natural gas liquids) from land-
based oilfields in Britain now totals about 87,000 tons. Prospecting for crude
petroleum has so far led to the establishment of several small oilfields, notably
in Nottinghamshire (Egmanton and Bothamsell), in Leicestershire (Plungar),
in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough) and in Dorset (Kimmeridge).
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East, Africa and Caribbean areas.
Today production by these companies amounts to about 17 per cent of total
world production and they operate a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and
partly on charter) amounting to over one-fifth of the world’s tanker tonnage.
(British registered tanker tonnage is over 12 per cent of the world’s total.)
In 1973 Britain’s net imports of crude oil were 112*6 million tons (despite
a shortfall in supplies in the last quarter) valued at £1,297*6 million, the largest

single item among imported products. Saudi Arabia supplied approximately
23 per cent, Iran 19 per cent, Kuwait 18 per cent and Libya 11 per cent. Other
major suppliers were Nigeria, Qatar and Venezuela.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1973 totalled about 97-8 million tons, having more than
doubled since i960. Fuel oil consumption in 1973 constituted about 40 per
cent of the total. Demand for gas and diesel oils (including derv fuel used in
road vehicles) remained fairly constant at over 20 million tons between 1972-
73. Sales of motor spirit expanded by nearly one million tons to 16-6 million
tons in 1973.
The most important uses of gas and diesel oils in 1972 were for non¬
industrial central heating, electricity generation, building and the railways.
Electricity generation accounted for 41 per cent of fuel oil consumption, fol¬
lowed by the iron and steel industry with 11 per cent, and non-industrial central
heating with a further 7 per cent. Of the remainder, the largest users were the
chemical, paper-making, glass, engineering and textile industries.
Before 1939 three-quarters of Britain’s supply of petroleum products was
refined overseas, as it was considered more economic to refine at the source of
production. Following the second world war refineries were mostly sited in the
consuming areas, but there have recently been proposals for the construction
of large refineries in some producer countries.
In 1974, refinery capacity in Britain amounted to 146 million tons a year.
Of the 21 refineries in operation, four have a capacity of under o-6 million
tons. The 15 largest are situated at Fawley, near Southampton (19*5 million
tons); Stanlow, in Cheshire (18 million tons); Isle of Grain (10-4 million tons),
Shell Haven (10 million tons), and Coryton (8-3 million tons), all three on
the Thames Estuary; Teesport, North Yorkshire (6 million tons), North Tees,
Cleveland (5 million tons); Grangemouth, east Scotland (8-7 million tons);
three at Milford Haven (15*2 million tons, 5-1 million tons and 3-9 million
tons) and one at Pembroke (9-3 million tons) in Dyfed; Llandarcy near
Swansea (8-2 million tons); and two at Killingholme near Grimsby (8-6
million tons and 4-2 million tons). The other two refineries are at Ellesmere,
Merseyside (1 -6 million tons) and Heysham in Lancashire (2 million tons).
Further refineries are planned in Scotland, Kent and on Canvey Island, Essex.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) has
risen steadily to over 104 million tons in 1973. There is a substantial external
trade in refined products which tends to follow trading and seasonal require¬
ments and the commercial arrangements of the major oil companies. Exports
from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products to European countries,
were valued at £316 million (f.o.b.) in 1973. Imports of refined products
amounted to £344 million (c.i.f.).
Four main crude oil pipelines are in operation in Britain between harbours
capable of berthing very large tankers and refineries: in west Scotland, from
Finnartto Grangemouth; in South Wales, from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to
Llandarcy; in north-west England, fromTranmere to Stanlow and Heysham;
and in the Humber area from a single buoy mooring in the Humber estuary
to Killingholme. A fifth, from an off-shore mooring, off Amlwch, Gwynedd, to
Stanlow is under construction (see p. 310). A 131-mile (211-kilometre) pipe¬
line is to be built from Cruden Bay, Scotland, to Grangemouth, for oil from
the Forties oilfield in the North Sea (see p. 261). Pipelines also carry refined
264 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
products to major marketing areas; for example, from the Humber to the
Manchester area, from Fawley to Staines, Surrey, and Heathrow Airport,
London, and from the Isle of Grain to Walton-on-Thames and Heathrow
Airport. A 245-mile (394-kilometre) pipeline feeds refined products to north
London and the Midlands from refineries and installations on the Thames and
Mersey; a similar line 300 miles (480 kilometres) long from Milford Haven to
the Midlands and Manchester is in operation. The pipeline from Fawley to
Severnmouth originally used for ethylene has been extended to Avonmouth
and is now used for refined products. Pipelines carrying petrochemical feed¬
stocks run from Stanlow to Carrington, near Manchester, and from Teesside
to Fleetwood, Lancashire, and Runcorn, Cheshire. The Pipelines Act 1962 is
designed to secure the orderly development of privately owned industrial
pipelines.
Research Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock,
in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon, in Oxfordshire (Esso). The first of these covers
the full range of petroleum research and development, from geology and
production to product utilisation and petroleum chemicals. In general, the
remainder are concerned with the evolution of new and improved fuels and
lubricants and the development of new uses for petroleum products and of
new products based on petroleum, especially chemicals.
ELECTRICITY
Present
Structure
England and
Wales
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at Godai¬
ming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has been a
feature of the industry. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were created as
a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a national scale through
voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity Board was set up to
construct and operate a national grid inter-connecting individual power
stations, thus co-ordinating generation and transmission. In 1943 the North of
Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was established as a public corpor¬
ation to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands. In 1948 all
municipal and private undertakings (other than those in Northern Ireland)
were acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Elec¬
tricity Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where
they became the responsibility of the NSHEB. Two subsequent Acts (1954
and 1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and gave the industry its
present structure. Electricity supply employs about 195,000 people, including
6,000 in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales, electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and distributed by 12 separate area
electricity boards; co-ordination is effected by the Electricity Council. In
Scotland, two boards—the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB)—both generate and distribute electricity. In Northern Ireland
these functions are carried out by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
The Electricity Council is the central body of the supply industry with a
general responsibility for promoting electricity supply and for advising the
Secretary of State for Energy; it is also responsible for a number of common
services, principally capital financing, research and industrial relations. The

council consists of a chairman and two deputy chairmen, the chairman and
two designated members of the CEGB, the chairmen of the 12 area electricity
boards and not more than three other members. The CEGB controls the
operation and maintenance of power stations and the main transmission
system (the national grid) and supplies electricity in bulk to the 12 area boards.
The CEGB consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and between six and
eight members. Each of the 12 area electricity boards acquires bulk supplies
of electricity from the CEGB and is responsible for distribution networks
and sales of electricity to its area consumers.
Area consultative councils were set up under the Electricity Act 1947 in
the area of each board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen
are ex officio members of their respective area boards. The Secretary of State
for Energy appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the
Electricity Council, the CEGB, the area boards and the consultative councils;
approves each board’s capital development programmes and the industry’s
research programme; and approves, in consultation with the Treasury, the
industry’s borrowing requirements.
The boundary separating the areas covered by the two Scottish boards runs
roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of
Tay. Members of both boards and of the respective consumer consultative
councils are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland; each board
comprises a chairman and between four and eight members, one of whom is
the chairman of the other board. The Secretary of State’s responsibilities in
relation to the boards are similar to those of the Secretary of State for Energy
in England and Wales.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. The Northern Ireland Electricity Service
came into operation on 1st April 1973. The new body is the result of the
amalgamation of four former electricity undertakings—the Northern Ireland
Joint Electricity Authority, the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland, and the
Electricity Departments of Belfast Corporation and Londonderry Develop¬
ment Commission. It has fixed assets valued at £211 million and a capital
expenditure programme for 1974-75 of £40 million. A consumers’ council
has also been set up.
Total sales of electricity in 1973 amounted to 225,057 gigawatt hours (GWh),
an increase of nearly 7 per cent over the previous year. Domestic users took
over 40 per cent of the total, industry nearly 39 per cent and commercial and
other users about 21 per cent. The electricity industry supplies about 21-5
million consumers of whom about 19 million are in England and Wales; of the
remainder over 1*5 million are supplied by the SSEB, over 490,000 by the
NSHEB and 500,000 by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
Most of the CEGB’s output capacity (over 60 per cent) is accounted for by
coal-fired steam generating stations. Oil-fired stations account for about 20
per cent and nuclear power stations for about another 6 per cent. The remainder
is made up of natural gas, gas turbine, diesel and hydro-electric plant. Nuclear
energy has become increasingly important since 1965. Water power resources
are relatively small and in remote areas.
Generation for the public supply in Britain reached nearly 259,000 GWh
in 1973; conventional steam power stations provided 89 per cent of the total
and nuclear and hydro-electric stations about 9 per cent and 2 per cent respec-

tively. A high rate of expansion of output has been a feature of the industry
since its earliest years; though the rate has slackened recently the total of
electricity generated in 1973 was still over 13 per cent higher than in 1970.
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Britain at the end of 1973 totalled 67,719 megawatts (MW), an increase of
4 per cent on the previous year.
Between 1965-73 nearly 30,000 MW of generating capacity was commis¬
sioned in England and Wales, including 2,882 MW in 1973, bringing total
generating capacity to 58,369 MW. The SSEB’s total installed capacity in 1973
was 6,260 MW and the NSHEB’s total installed capacity is 1,832 MW. In
Northern Ireland total generating capacity was 1,509 MW in 1973, of which
some 1,025 MW was installed in oil-fired stations and the remainder in coal-
fired stations.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
—23,221 GWh in 1973. The major sources outside the fuel industries them¬
selves are the chemical, iron and steel and paper industries and the nuclear
power plants of the Atomic Energy Authority.
An analysis of electricity generation in Great Britain is given in Table 22.

The electricity authorities account for 57 per cent of the British consumption
of coal and about 18 per cent of the consumption of oil.
Oil-fired stations of 2,000 MW have been commissioned at Pawley, on
Southampton Water (one of the most fully automated stations in Europe), and
at Pembroke, South Wales, and others are under construction at Inverkip,
Renfrewshire (1,980 MW), Isle of Grain, Kent (3,300 MW) and Ince,
Cheshire (1,000 MW). Preparatory work on the sites of two other oil-fired
stations started at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire (1,320 MW) in 1973 and Little-
brook, Kent (1,980 MW) in 1974.
A dual-fired station to burn either coal or oil has been commissioned at
Kingsnorth, Kent, and two stations involving some 1,500 MW of plant have
been converted to dual natural gas/coal-firing. Average thermal efficiency
(that is, the ratio of the electrical energy output to the heat energy input of the
fuel consumed) of conventional steam stations in England and Wales rose
from 2075 per cent in 1947 to 29-84 per cent in 1973-74 as new plant was

brought into use. The 20 most efficient stations, containing much of the
newest plant, had an average thermal efficiency of 33-68 per cent in 1973-74.
Striking advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant.
The installation of 49 single-shaft units of 500 MW in 14 stations has been
substantially completed. Station capacities are also increasing. Ten stations,
each with capacities of 2,000 MW, with four 500 MW single-shaft generating
units, are now in service. Twenty-three 660 MW single-shaft generating
units are on order for installation; three for Drax I, North Yorkshire, where
two have already been synchronised; five for Isle of Grain, Kent; three for
Inverkip, Renfrew; two for Peterhead, Aberdeenshire; and two each for five
nuclear power stations under construction (for locations see map, p. 265).
Units of 1,300 MW are under consideration. A 2,400 MW station at Longannet,
Fife, with four 600 MW cross-compound units, was commissioned in 1970.
Large gas turbine units of 55 MW and 70 MW, based on aero jet engines,
have been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and
SSEB have installed 916 MW of such units and a further 3,400 MW are
planned. Many others of 17 to 35 MW capacity are being used in new stations
to safeguard the auxiliary supplies to the large new steam units, and also to
provide capacity for peak operation. Auxiliary units of this kind in service at
the end of 1973 totalled 1,174 MW.
In 1973 nuclear power stations provided some 23,657 GWh of electricity or
9 per cent of Britain’s electricity generation by the public supply system.
Britain accounts for about 17 per cent of world nuclear generation (excluding
the Soviet Union). Since 1962 Britain has produced over 260,000 gigawatt-
hours of nuclear-generated electricity, as much as the United States and much
more than any other country, and about 34 per cent of total world generation
from nuclear sources. Nuclear capacity forms about 6 per cent of total output
capacity of the public supply system.
The stations that generate nuclear electricity are owned by various authori¬
ties. The original prototypes built by the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) at
Calder Hall, Cumbria (198 MW)—the first in the world to operate on a com¬
mercial scale—and at Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire (198 MW), are owned and
operated by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (see p. 406). This company, which
along with the Radiochemical Centre Ltd. was set up in 1971 and took over
from the AEA the manufacture and reprocessing of nuclear fuels for Britain
and other countries, is closely associated with the new single company set up
by the Government to design and construct steam supply systems for nuclear
power stations (see p. 406).
The AEA has four experimental or prototype stations which also produce
electricity for the national grid: the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) at
Windscale, Cumbria (14 MW electrical output); the experimental fast breeder
station (14 MW) and the prototype fast breeder station (250 MW) at Doun-
reay, Caithness; and the Steam Generating Heavy Water Moderated Reactor
(SGHWR) at Winfrith, Dorset (100 MW).
Most of Britain’s nuclear-generated electricity is, however, supplied by
stations owned and operated by the electricity authorities. These, like Calder
Hall and Chapelcross, are all magnox stations—graphite-moderated, carbon-
dioxide cooled, using natural uranium metal fuel elements canned in magne¬
sium alloy. Under the first commercial programme, originally announced in
1955 but since twice modified, nine magnox stations with a total design capacity
of 4,500 MW were in operation by 1972: Berkeley, in Gloucestershire (276
MW design capacity), and Bradwell, in Essex (300 MW), were both com-

missioned in 1962; Hunterston ‘A’, in Scotland (300 MW), in 1964; and in the
following year Hinkley Point ‘A’, in Somerset, Trawsfynydd, in Wales (both
500 MW), and Dungeness ‘A’, in Kent (550 MW); Sizewell, in Suffolk (580
MW), was commissioned in 1966; and Oldbury, in Gloucestershire (600 MW),
in 1968. A ninth station, Wylfa, in Anglesey (1,180 MW), was commissioned
in 1971.
Under a second programme announced in 1964 and extended in 1965, a
further 8,000 MW of nuclear capacity was planned, of which about 6,500 MW
will be commissioned by 1978. The reactor design chosen for the programme
is based on the AGR at Windscale, a logical development of the magnox
system, which uses slightly enriched uranium dioxide fuel canned in stainless
steel. The first five AGR stations under construction are Dungeness ‘B’
(1,200 MW); and Hinkley Point ‘B’, Hunterston ‘B’, Hartlepool, County
Durham, and Heysham, Lancashire (each of 1,320 MW capacity).
A third programme using the SGHWR was announced in July 1974. In the
initial four-year phase a further 4,000 MW of nuclear capacity, based on
reactor units of 600-660 MW to reduce the problems of scaling-up from the
prototype at Winfrith, is planned. Thereafter it is intended to build up orders
for further nuclear plant as rapidly as progress with the initial stations allows.
A large prototype fast reactor (PFR) of 250 MW capacity was commissioned
by the AEA in 1974 at Dounreay (where in 1962 the experimental fast reactor
became the first of such type to produce electricity for public use and to
operate at a high power level). It is expected that the first full-scale order
for a Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor will be placed in the late 1970s, and that
from the mid-1980s a major part of nuclear orders will be for this type of
station.
In 1973 a new single nuclear design and construction company, the National
Nuclear Corporation, was set up to replace the two construction consortia set
up in 1968.
Hydro-electric generation is at present confined to Scotland and Wales. Most
of the water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with their
own natural catchment areas. The setting up of the NSHEB in 1943 marked
the beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the High¬
lands.
In 1973-74, 3,197 GWh were sent out by the NSHEB from water-power,
compared with 322 GWh in 1949. At the end of March 1974 there were 53
main hydro-electric conventional stations in operation in the north of Scotland
with a total installed capacity of 1,053 MW and the largest—the Loch Sloy
station—has a capacity of 130 MW. The Cruachan pumped storage section of
the Awe scheme, with an installed capacity of 400 MW from four reversible-
pump-turbines, came into full operation at the end of 1967. (In pumped-
storage schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump water
to higher levels from which it descends at peak periods to operate turbo¬
generators.)
Construction of a 300 MW pumped-storage project, with two 150 MW
reversible-pump-turbines, at Foyers, Loch Ness, began in 1969. In addition,
there are stations generating electricity by water power in the south of Scot¬
land (123 MW) and in Wales (470 MW). The latter includes the 360 MW
pumped-storage station at Ffestiniog. Work has started on a 1,500 MW
pumped-storage station at Dinorwic, North Wales.
Main electricity transmission lines—the national grid—supply most of the
country. By 31st March 1973 those of the CEGB totalled over 9,000 circuit

miles (14,500 kilometres), of which 6,600 miles (10,600 kilometres) were at
400,000 volts, and 2,400 miles (3,900 kilometres) at 275,000 volts. Primary dis¬
tribution in England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, comprising 11,000 circuit
miles (18,000 kilometres) of lines, with secondary distribution at 33,000 volts,
tertiary at 11,000 volts and general low voltage distribution at 415/240 volts
(standardisation of supply to consumers at 240 volts is almost completed). In
Scotland there were some 5,000 circuit miles (8,000 kilometres) of main trans¬
mission lines at the end of March 1973, of which 1,700 circuit miles (2,800 kilo¬
metres) operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary
distribution in Scotland is at 33,000 volts. Energy movements on the grid in
England and Wales are controlled through the seven operational areas, set up
for that purpose and distinct from the regions in which the generating side of
the industry is organised; each area has a separate control, and the operations
are co-ordinated by a National Control in London. The grid in Scotland is
operated from the control centres at Pitlochry (NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch
(SSEB).
The development of the grid system has made the British system the largest
fully interconnected power network under unified control in the world. Twin
cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, capable of
transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current), have been in
operation since 1961; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
In England and Wales the area electricity boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the CEGB, supplemented from other sources,
such as industrial plants, and the nuclear power stations of the AEA. There
are 19 million consumers. The NSHEB has about 488,000 consumers, many
in remote areas. The SSEB supplies more than 1-5 million consumers.
Industrial concerns are the biggest users of electricity. The principal domestic
uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking and for space and water heating, but
the demand for numerous other domestic purposes is rising steadily.
Some 4 per cent of Britain’s annual gross fixed capital formation in 1973 was
attributable to the electricity supply industry. The industry’s plans for new
capital investment are based on a growth in demand estimated at an annual
average rate of about 4*5 per cent up to 1979-80.
Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry expanded rapidly
from 3^249 million in 1956 to £720 million in 1966 but has since fallen to
£500 million in 1973-74. About one-half of the industry’s capital requirements
has been financed from internal resources. The statutory limit to borrowings
by the industry in Great Britain is £6,150 million, with provision for extension
to £7,700 million. The Gas and Electricity Act 1968 empowered the industry
to borrow (long term) from overseas sources.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for
Energy, is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research,
comprising direct research carried out by the electricity boards themselves,
supported by co-operative research with selected industrial research associa¬
tions and by research contracts placed with universities and other organisations.
The council itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the
Electricity Supply Research Council. Collaboration on research between the
supply industry and the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power
Engineering Research Steering Committee set up in 1966.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the CEGB and

comprise the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead,
Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in Gloucestershire, concerned with nuclear
problems, and the Engineering Laboratories at Marchwood, on Southampton
Water. Research on distribution technology and electricity utilisation is under¬
taken at the Electricity Council Research Centre at Capenhurst, Cheshire, and
by the area boards.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity authorities. The
SSEB undertakes a wide range of research and development work, both in¬
dependently and in conjunction with the universities and manufacturers and,
with the NSHEB, is associated with the activities of the Electricity Council
and CEGB.
An energy conservation programme was announced by the Government in
June 1974. The programme includes the following measures: the establish¬
ment of an Advisory Council on Energy Conservation to advise the Secretary
of State for Energy on the promotion of energy efficiency; the commissioning
of a feasibility study of the use of sea-wave power to generate electricity; an
examination of the economies of combined generation of heat and electricity;
the monitoring of overseas work on new and alternative sources of energy by
the Energy Technology Support Unit (see p. 253); amendments to building
regulations to double the thermal insulation requirements of new buildings;
consideration of the use of house improvement grants (see p. 182) to encourage
high standards of insulation in existing buildings; extension of the use of more
efficient heating systems in government buildings; exploration of prospects
for more efficient vehicles to give lower fuel consumption; promotion of
informed public debate with special encouragement to universities and pro¬
fessional institutions to include fuel efficiency more prominently in their
syllabuses; a programme of consultation with major engineering and trade
institutions, the fuel industries and other interested bodies to stimulate greater
action on energy economy; the establishment of an ‘energy thrift’ committee
by the Department of Industry to co-ordinate research and development work
aimed at a more efficient use of energy in manufacturing industry; and the
pursuit of an active policy of international co-operation on major issues of
energy policy.
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has
been assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and
by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National
Coal Board, solid fuel distributors and appliance manufacturers and distri¬
butors. Originally formed in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users on the
best use of solid fuel, including the choice of installation and the operation of
solid fuel appliances.
NON-FUEL MINERALS
Although Britain’s requirements of raw materials are met mostly by imports,
non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make a useful contribution to the
economy. Output of non-fuel minerals increased by 69 per cent in terms of
quantity and 127 per cent in terms of value between 1963 and 1973. Capital
expenditure in the non-fuel mining and quarrying industry in 1972 amounted
to £37 million, most of which was on plant and machinery and the remainder
on land and buildings. The total number of employees in the industry was

41,700 in 1973. The geographical locations of some of the more important
minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on p. 272.
Under the Mineral Exploration and Investment Grants Act 1972 the Secretary
of State for Industry can encourage exploration for mineral resources by pro¬
viding financial assistance of up to 35 per cent of the cost of searching for
mineral deposits in Great Britain and on Britain’s Continental Shelf, and
evaluating them for commercial purposes. Minerals included in the scheme
are the ores of non-ferrous metals, fluorspar, barium minerals and potash. By
the end of March 1974, 30 companies had sought assistance totalling £13
million in respect of 124 exploration projects, mainly for non-ferrous metals.
Work on 36 projects has been completed. The assistance is to be repaid with
interest if a project leads to the extraction of minerals in commercial quantities.
An exploration programme aimed at providing preliminary information on
areas with potentially economic mineral deposits in Great Britain is being
undertaken by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) on behalf
of the Department of Industry. Under a three-year programme costing ^1-3
million the Institute of Geological Sciences, a component body of NERC, is
carrying out work aimed at providing basic geological information on five
identified areas which may yield economic deposits of minerals.
In 1973 Britain imported ^815 million worth of non-ferrous metals (ores,
concentrates and scrap), an increase of 40 per cent over the previous year,
reflecting mainly the sharp rise in world commodity prices. Britain’s imports
of unwrought metals in 1973 were worth £559 million, an increase of 46 per
cent over 1972. Imports of semi-manufactures of non-ferrous metals (for
example rods, tubes, sheets and bars) were worth £91 million. Exports of
minerals were worth ^60 million, unwrought metals ^3^6 million and mineral-
based semi-manufactures ^145 million in 1973.
The approximate value of non-fuel minerals produced in Britain in 1973
reached £399 million, an increase of 18 per cent compared with 1972. In
quantity terms output increased by 12 per cent.
Sands and gravel are second only to coal in terms of tonnage of minerals pro¬
duced in Britain. They are primarily used as an aggregate or bulking material,
in the main for concrete (accounting for about 75 per cent of total production)
and road construction. In 1973 136 million tonnes of common sand and gravel
worth over j£ioo million were produced; 16 million tonnes or 12 per cent of
the total were marine-dredged. Britain is the world’s largest producer of
marine-dredged aggregates. Total past production is about 2,500 million
tonnes, of which over half has been raised in the last 15 years. It is estimated
that about 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) are worked each year.
More specialised sands used in glass-making and metal-founding are also
produced. In 1973 production of these special silica sands amounted to 6-4
million tonnes. Virtually all glass produced in Britain is made from domesti¬
cally produced silica sands.
Limestone, igneous rock, sandstone and chalk are all quarried for use in the
construction industry. (Limestone is also used by the steel industry.) Produc¬
tion in 1973 included: 106 million tonnes of limestone, valued at £94 million;
49 million tonnes of igneous rock valued at £58 million; 17 million tonnes of
sandstone (including silica stone and ganister) valued at about £21 million;
and 23 million tonnes of chalk (including chert and flint) valued at about £12

million. The production of slate has declined steadily in recent years to a level
of about 60,000 tonnes a year.
In 1973 Britain produced 41 •! million tonnes of clays, valued at £49 million.
Britain is the world’s main producer of china clay, which is used mainly as a
filler and coater for fine quality paper, for making high quality pottery and
also in the paint, rubber, plastics, insecticide, and fertiliser industries; output
in 1973 was 3-4 million tonnes, most of which was for export. Other main
types of clay produced included ball clay, used in the pottery and ceramics
industries, and fireclays, used for bricks and refractory products.
Production of iron ore in 1973 was estimated at 7*1 million tonnes. Although
indigenous iron ore was important to Britain’s industrial development, the
remaining low-grade domestic ores are not competitive with high-grade ores
and concentrates from overseas and production has been falling in recent
years.
The most important non-ferrous metal produced in Britain is tin, which was
first worked in Cornwall over 2,000 years ago. Production was at its highest
in the early 1870s, amounting to about 15,000 tonnes a year of dressed ore,
but by the early 1950s production had fallen to about 1,400 tonnes a year.
Increasing demand for base metals since then has brought about a recovery in
production, which has more than trebled since 1970 to reach 10,138 tonnes of
dressed ore in 1973. Cornish mines supplied Britain with nearly 20 per cent
of its tin ore requirements in 1973. There are now four mines and a fifth one
is being developed. Some copper, zinc and silver are produced in association
with the tin. Production of lead ore has remained fairly constant over the past
few years in the range of 6,000-7,000 tonnes of dressed ore a year.
Among other domestically produced minerals Britain is a major world pro¬
ducer of salt, fluorspar, gypsum, anydrite, and celestite. Britain is virtually
self-sufficient in salt, the value of production being nearly £20 million in 1973.
The value of fluorspar produced in 1973 was £5 million while that of gypsum
and anhydrite combined was ^7 million. Potash production started in North
Yorkshire towards the end of 1973; output is expected to be over 1 million
tonnes by 1975 and to exceed domestic consumption, about 95 per cent of
which is accounted for by fertiliser manufacturers.
Britain also produces small amounts of talc, mica clay, diatomite and
mineral pigments.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements. The sources of water are, however,
often distant from the areas where supplies are needed. Supplies are obtained
partly from surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in
upland gathering grounds and river intakes, and partly from underground
sources by means of wells, adits and boreholes.
The householder receives his domestic water supply at a comparatively
small charge, varying in different areas, which he usually pays by way of a
water rate levied, like other rates, on the net annual value of his house. Indus¬
trial users are charged in most cases according to actual metered consumption.
Evolution
The provision of water supplies became a general public service in Britain in
the nineteenth century, largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick (a well-

known social reformer) and his colleagues who demonstrated the dangers to
health arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation. Under the Public
Health Act of 1848, which laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing
with public health, a number of statutory water undertakings were established
to provide water to the expanding urban population and the water supply
system developed rapidly although in piecemeal fashion with some over¬
lapping and waste. Where no commercial undertaking was willing and able to
do so, the Public Health Act 1875 empowered local authorities to provide
water supplies.
The Water Act 1945 laid a structural basis for the water supply industry,
and while embodying the principle of mixed public and private ownership of
water undertakings, gave more central direction to the industry’s development
and fostered amalgamations. The Water Resources Act of 1963 created river
authorities to administer, and a Water Resources Board to review, national
water resources and requirements in England and Wales. There were similar
arrangements in Scotland under the Water (Scotland) Act 1967 (see p. 276).
Water supply continued to be provided mainly by some 180 statutory water
undertakings.
A further radical reconstruction of the administrative arrangements for water
supply in England and Wales under the Water Act 1973 came into effect in
1974 alongside the new arrangements for local government (see p. 64). (For
the position in Scotland see p. 276 and in Northern Ireland p. 277).
Responsibility for promoting a national policy for water in England and Wales
rests with the Secretary of State for the Environment, the Secretary of State
for Wales and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Water
Resources Board has been abolished and its function taken over by a Central
Water Planning Unit.
Under the Act, nine regional water authorities have been set up in England and
a Welsh National Water Development Authority in Wales. Each water
authority consists of a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State, members
appointed by the Secretary of State and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and a majority of members appointed by local authorities. The
functions of the water authorities include water conservation; water supply;
sewerage and sewage disposal (district and London borough councils usually
act as agents, on behalf of their water authorities, for the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of public sewers in their areas); control of river
pollution; maintenance; development and improvement of fisheries; land
drainage; and recreational amenities relating to water.
The Act provides for the continued supply of water by statutory water com¬
panies for the water authorities both within and outside their limits of supply.
It makes special arrangements governing the relationship of statutory water
companies to the water authorities and for control of the latter over them.
A National Water Council has been set up to advise and assist ministers and
water authorities. The council consists of a chairman appointed by the
Secretaries of State, the chairmen of the water authorities, and ten other
members with special relevant knowledge, of whom eight have been appointed
by the Secretaries of State and two by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food.

A Water Space Amenity Commission has been established to advise the
Secretary of State for the Environment, the National Water Council and the
water authorities on the discharge of their functions relating to recreational
and amenity use of water space in England. The commission consists of a
chairman appointed by the Secretary of State, the chairmen of the water
authorities and not more than ten other members appointed by the Secretary
of State—one in consultation with the Countryside Commission.
Public water supplies in England and Wales—reaching over 99 per cent of
the total population—now total some 3,190 million gallons (i4-5 million
cubic metres) a day, out of a total estimated abstraction of nearly 5,320 million
gallons (24-2 million cubic metres) a day (excluding water used for cooling
in connection with electricity generation). Capital expenditure on water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal is estimated at £330 million in 1973-74.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1971. By
March 1974 schemes costing over ^555 million had been completed or were
in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.

Wales published in 1974 (see Bibliography p. 276) considers that no more than
five new strategic reservoirs need be built in England and Wales this century
and recommends the development of the Dee Estuary for water storage and
the enlargement of a number of existing reservoirs.
The administrative arrangements for water supply and distribution in Scot¬
land were reorganised by the Water (Scotland) Act 1967 under which the
functions of 200 local water authorities were transferred to 13 regional water
boards in 1968. The Act also established the Central Scotland Water Develop¬
ment Board to supply water in bulk to its seven constituent regional water
boards; it does not supply direct to individual consumers. All the members of
these boards are members of town or county councils.
The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in England and
Wales except that there is not the same need to allocate water between com¬
peting interests and requirements are met almost entirely from surface
sources. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for general over¬
sight and co-ordination and has a general duty to promote the conservation of
water resources in Scotland; and to require regional water boards to provide
supplies of wholesome water everywhere in their regions, where this can be
done at reasonable cost; at present, they supply over 98 per cent of the total
population. A survey of currently available supplies and likely demands to the
end of the present century and of potential services to be developed was
carried out by the Scottish Development Department in consultation with the
water boards (see Bibliography, p. 276). The Scottish Water Advisory Com¬
mittee advises the Secretary of State on general questions relating to resources
and supplies and the organisation of the water service. The Rural Water
Supplies and Sewerage Act 1944, as amended, makes available to Scottish
regional water boards and to local authorities grant assistance up to a maxi¬
mum of £60 million towards the cost of water supplies and sewerage schemes.
The 12 new regional and island councils to be set up in Scotland in 1975 to
carry out local government functions (see p. 65) are to be responsible for
water supply and sewerage; separate river purification authorities will con¬
tinue to be responsible for the regulation of the discharges of effluent to rivers
and certain tidal waters. The Central Scotland Water Development Board will

be reconstituted to carry out co-ordinating functions and administer water
schemes supplying more than one regional council in central Scotland.
Northern Ireland has abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic
and industrial consumption. Over 90 per cent of the population has a piped
supply. Between 1945 and 1973 over j£ioo million was expended on water and
sewerage services—over £50 million by way of government grants. The
Government, responsible for water conservation and pollution control under
the Water Act (NI) 1972, took over from local authorities, on 1st October 1973,
responsibility for water supply and sewerage services. The Water and Sewer¬
age (NI) Order 1973 requires the Department of Environment to provide
these services.
The largest new source for water supply is Lough Neagh and in order to
conserve the potential and to co-ordinate the various interests and demands on
this water resource system a comprehensive water management programme
has been prepared.
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s water re¬
sources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain, and in
the Ground Water Year Book for England and Wales published annually by
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. Detailed studies of the resources and use of
water in specified areas have been published in the series of hydrological
surveys which cover approximately half of England and Wales. General
information on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the res¬
ponsibility of the Meteorological Office.
A Water Research Centre has been set up to co-ordinate water research in
the whole of Britain (see p. 396). The Water Research Centre’s station at
Medmenham and the Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of the
Environment at Wallingford carry out research into problems of the design
and calibration of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of surface
water, and into other hydraulic problems.
Barrage projects involve dams across or within tidal estuaries to form a lake
of fresh water, and studies have been carried out for several estuaries in
Britain. A report on a study for Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, published early
in 1972, put forward several suggested schemes, including a barrage and
storage reservoirs. A three-year survey is being carried out into plans for the
Wash, and a report has been published on the estuary of the Dee.
The regional water authorities in England and the Welsh National Water
Development Authority in Wales are responsible for the control of pollution
in rivers and certain tidal water in their areas and their approval must be
sought before polluting effluents are discharged. In Scotland river pollution
is controlled by either river purification boards or local authorities. In Northern
Ireland it is the responsibility of the Department of Environment.
The Government’s aim is to improve the quality of water in all the main
rivers by the early 1980s. The River Pollution Survey records in detail progress
already made in reducing river pollution.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory at Stevenage, part of the Water
Research Centre, investigates problems connected with the treatment of
polluted water, the treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial waste
water, and the effects and prevention of pollution of surface water and
underground water.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest
and most important industries. It occupies 704,000 people or 2*9 per cent of
the total in civil employment, provides about 3’3 per cent of the gross national
product, and uses 47 million of the 60 million acres (19 million of the 24
million hectares) of land.
THE LAND AND The soils of the country are varied (see p. 5). Land used for farming is
ITS USES conventionally divided into land suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and
rough grazing. In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is
usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
In Britain there are 30 million acres (12-1 million hectares) under crops and
grass. Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodlands (ancillary to farming) and
other land used for agriculture together represent 79 per cent of the land area.
The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area
available for farming is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing and
industry; so far, the loss has been offset by the increase in output from what
remains. The ratio of rough grazing—used for stock, mainly sheep—to better
quality agricultural land varies considerably throughout Britain. In the
southern half of England, for example, it constitutes only about one-sixth of
the total acreage, increasing to one-fifth in Northern Ireland, about a third
in the hill regions of England and Wales and nearly three-quarters in Scotland.
Size of Farms There are about 280,000 statistically significant farming units in Britain. Some
41 per cent are very small units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for
less than a tenth of the industry’s total output. Of the 164,000 full-time farm
businesses some 39,500 are classified (by standard man-days) as large farm
businesses (capable of employing four or more men full-time): these, account¬
ing for some 14 per cent of the number of holdings, produce more than half the
industry’s total output. There are 55,300 medium-sized (two-three men) and
69,300 small farm businesses. The total is falling by about 6 per cent a year.
Amalgamation of small farms into larger, more viable units has been en¬
couraged by successive governments. The average size of full-time holdings
in Britain is 237 acres (96 hectares) of crops and grass (including rough
grazings).
Some 35,000 of the total of significant farming units are in Northern
Ireland: over half of these provide a full-time occupation for the owner and
produce over four-fifths of the total output. The average farm size is 55 acres

(22 hectares). Other holdings, of which there are about 16,000, are either
extremely small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or grazing).
The increasing use of intensive methods of production both in crops and in
animal husbandry has led to greater specialisation. Three-fifths of the full¬
time farms in Britain are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep.
One in six is a cropping farm and the remainder specialise in pigs, poultry or
horticulture or are mixed farms. In England the farms devoted primarily to
arable crops are in the eastern part of the country—in East Anglia, Kent,
Lincolnshire and Humberside. In Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast
are also primarily arable. Potato and vegetable growing on a substantial scale
marks the farming of the Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the
alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in
south Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important crop in Dyfed and the south¬
west. Elsewhere, horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural
crops.
Dairying occurs widely, but there are concentrations in south-west Scot¬
land, the western parts of England and south-west Wales, where the wetter
climate encourages the growth of good grass. Sheep and cattle are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening takes place partly on better grassland areas and partly
in yards on arable farms.
In Northern Ireland dairying is the main occupation on 40 per cent of the
full-time farms, while a further 35 per cent concentrate on beef and sheep
production. The remainder are either specialised cropping and horticultural
holdings, intensive pig and poultry units or mixed farms with no predominant
single enterprise. Oats and barley are widely grown, mainly for livestock
feeding, and the only important cash crop is potatoes.
The increase in production which has occurred over the past decades is a
result of the effort of individual farmers, of farmers’ organisations, of research
workers and advisers and of government action. The role of the Government
is described on pp. 287-91.
The steady expansion in production and in yield per acre of arable land which
has taken place since 1936 is summarised in Table 23. Apart from a slight
decline between 1961 and 1964, and another in 1968, total cattle stocks have
risen each year since 1957, to reach a record figure of nearly 14-7 million at the
end of 1973. Over the past decade the beef herd has grown considerably, but
expansion in the milk-producing herd has been less marked. Numbers of sheep
and lambs reached their highest level in 1966; although they later declined,
steady expansion is now evident again. Numbers of pigs have increased by
over one-quarter during the past decade, as have those of poultry. Arable
production has shown a greater diversification since the second world war.
Total cereals production has increased considerably since i960, reaching over
15 million tons in 1973-74. Potato production is susceptible to weather con¬
ditions but, on average, adequate supplies are maintained from a steadily
declining area. Between 1963 and 1972-73 output of pigmeat increased by one-
quarter and eggs by one-tenth; these increases, together with those in beef
and milk, resulted in higher consumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home
resources. Between 5 million and 6 million tons of concentrated feeds are
imported each year, depending on the size of the home crop of cereals.
The index of agricultural net product (all holdings) at constant prices has

risen steadily. By 1953-54 it was some 56 per cent above the immediate pre¬
war average; it rose a further 36 per cent between 1954-57 and 1964-67.
With the average of 1968-72 as a base, the index for all commercially signi¬
ficant holdings reached no in 1972-73; 114 is forecast for 1973-74.
The British climate suits grassland farming. Grassland forms an important
section of the economy of most farms, whether as permanent grass, mostly
occupying land less suitable for cultivation, or as sown grassland (leys), often
part of the arable rotation. A wide range of herbage species and varieties are
used, over half the total supply of herbage seed being produced in Britain.
Grassland production has been enhanced over recent years by the develop¬
ment and application of new techniques, notably the increased use of fertilisers
(especially nitrogenous), methods of grazing control, improved herbage con¬
servation for winter feed and irrigation. Rough grazings remain as semi¬
natural grassland used for extensively grazed flocks and herds, producing
young animals for fattening elsewhere.
Wheat is grown mainly in the eastern half of England. About 4-9 million tons
were harvested in 1973, with average yields estimated at i'74 tons per acre
(4-37 tonnes per hectare). Between one-third and one-half of the wheat crop
is used for flour milling, the remainder going mainly for animal feed.
Since 1961 the area under barley has increased by nearly 50 per cent and in
general production has risen faster because yields have also increased. The
malting and distilling market currently absorbs about one-sixth of the crop;
most of the remainder is retained by farms or sold for animal feed.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often
used on a co-operative basis.
In Great Britain the total area of fodder crops has fallen because in many
cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically by increased grass
production and improved methods of conservation. The principal fodder crops
are beans and kale in England and turnips and swedes in Scotland.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire under contract to the
British Sugar Corporation (see p. 289), which also provides technical advice
and assistance. The whole crop is mechanically harvested.
Potatoes are grown in most parts of Britain. First supplies of early potatoes
normally come at the end of May, and the lifting of main crop varieties usually
starts in September. Seed potato production for Britain and for export is
chiefly centred in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Britain is normally self-sufficient in main-crop potatoes. As yields are
increasing, requirements, including the increased demand for processed
potatoes, can be met from a declining acreage. The area planted in 1973 was
556,000 acres (237,000 hectares) and the average yield per acre was 11-7 tons.
This resulted in an overall balance of supply and demand. Although potato
production is becoming increasingly mechanised, much hand labour is still
needed.
Milk is more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when con¬
verted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk is
produced primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the greater
part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Average consumption of
liquid milk per head is 4-8 pints (27 litres) a week.

Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by about
13 per cent and now average some 876 gallons (3,892 litres) a year. Freedom
from tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate
brucellosis is under way. The Friesian breed is dominant in the dairy herds of
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Ayrshire breed in Scotland.
Average herd size is 36 cows. Milk production has been stimulated by advances
in grassland management, intensive grazing techniques and new methods of
making high quality hay and silage. Most dairy farmers practise some degree
of intensive grass management, but hay or silage of the traditional type supple¬
mented with purchased concentrates remain the basic winter feeds.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers seeking to replenish and improve their herds and flocks.
British breeds have recently been joined by a number of continental breeds.
Artificial insemination plays an important part in cattle breeding, about
two-thirds of the dairy herd in Great Britain being bred in this way, through
centres operated by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organisations.
In the hill regions hardy herds of beef cattle are kept, especially of the Gallo¬
way and Welsh Black breeds and their crosses; in marginal land and lower
areas the sires used are predominantly of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford
breeds. About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the dairy
herds, some females being mated to beef sires. There is a large and complex
trade in store cattle (increased by animals imported from the Irish Republic),
a typical movement being from the upland west to grazing areas in the Mid¬
lands. The demand for lean tender beef at an economic price has stimulated
the development of intensive and semi-intensive systems of production.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production. More than 30 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a particular area. Research has provided vaccine and sera protection
against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages; first, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more rapidly
maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on to the more genial low¬
land conditions, where they become crossed again with Down rams for fat
lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the lowland sires
fecundity and early maturity. Fat lamb production provides the main source
of income for sheep farmers but wool is also of considerable importance,
especially to farmers in hill areas.
Pig production is carried on in most parts of Britain but is particularly
important in the eastern and southern counties of England and in Northern
Ireland, where numbers have doubled since about 1950. There is an increasing
concentration into specialist units and larger herds. The most frequently used
breeds are the Large White and the Landrace though considerable cross¬
breeding takes place. Pig improvements are fostered through research by the
Meat and Livestock Commission and by leading commercial firms. Artificial
insemination is available nationally.
About 30 per cent of the pig meat is used for bacon and 70 per cent for
pork and manufacturing into sausages and other processed forms.

The British poultry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, aided by
the application of improved husbandry and management techniques in
intensive production units and to genetic improvements in stock. Only a small
proportion of total production is in the hands of the smallest producers—72
per cent of the laying birds on farms are in flocks of 5,000 or more and 72 per
cent of the broilers are in flocks of 50,000 or more. The average yield of eggs
per bird is about 230 a year and nearly all eggs consumed in Britain are home-
produced. About 340 million broilers and other special table chickens were
slaughtered in 1973. Turkey production has been increasing annually.
The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
flower crops which are together worth nearly 11 per cent of the total from
agriculture as a whole—an estimated £403 million in 1973-74 out °f a total
of ^3.773 million.
At the June 1973 census the land on which these crops were grown amounted
to nearly 693,000 acres (280,000 hectares), just over 2 per cent of the land used
for crops and grass. Of crops in the open, fruit accounted for 185,000 acres
(74,900 hectares), vegetables, excluding potatoes, for 462,000 acres (187,000
hectares), and flowers, bulbs and nursery stock for 40,000 acres (16,200
hectares). Crops under glass, including mushrooms, occupied 6,000 acres
(2,400 hectares).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings where soil,
climate, skilled labour and water can produce maximum yields of high quality
crops and where access to markets or good roads enable them to be sold at
economic prices. Most horticultural enterprises are expanding with the help
of improved planting material, new techniques of cultivation and environ¬
mental control and the widespread use of machinery. Some horticultural crops
form parts of general farm rotations but the returns from increased specialisa¬
tion favour separate horticultural enterprises. Traditional market gardening,
which once flourished around the large centres of population, has declined over
the years, mainly due to the growth in the field-scale production of vegetables
to meet the demands of the processing industries.
Of the land used for fruit growing in 1973, 45,000 acres (18,200 hectares) were
devoted to small fruit and the remainder was under orchards. The acreage of
apple orchards (excluding cider apples), some 91,000 acres (36,800 hectares),
continues to decline, but yields have increased to some 5 tons per acre on
average. Dessert apples are the most widespread fruit crop, grown mainly in
Kent and neighbouring counties, in East Anglia and to the north and south of
Bristol. Recent plantings are largely of the autumn and winter variety of Cox’s
Orange Pippin; many of the new orchards consist of closely planted dwarf trees
which can be efficiently pruned, sprayed and picked. England and Northern
Ireland are among the few countries which grow varieties of apples especially
suitable for cooking, the best-known of which is Bramley’s Seedling. There
are 12,300 acres (5,000 hectares) under varieties of cider apples.
Although pears thrive best in the warmer continental climate, in the east
and south-east of England where somewhat similar conditions prevail the
Conference pear and a few other high quality varieties are produced. Cherries
and plums are grown in Kent, and plums also in the Vale of Evesham and
parts of East Anglia. Around Perth in Scotland is the largest concentration of
raspberry plantations in the world. This forms the basis of an important
processing industry.
Strawberries are the most widespread small fruit, accounting for some 19,000
acres (7,700 hectares), the main-crop areas being in Kent and East Anglia.

Blackcurrants are also widely grown in Britain, mainly for the preparation of
juice for the manufacture of soft drinks and flavours for confectionery. Other
fruits include gooseberries, red and white currants, loganberries and black¬
berries. Almost all the nuts consumed in Britain are imported but a few cob
nuts and filberts are still grown in parts of Kent.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re¬
equipped since the mid-1960s with the aid of grants. There are now, in many
parts of the country, large units with automatic control of light, heat, ventila¬
tion, water and the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. Tomatoes form
the most important glasshouse crop, either as a single crop or in rotation with
others, and together with lettuce and cucumbers represent some 95 per cent
of the total value of glasshouse vegetable output. There is increasing demand
for sweet peppers and aubergines, two crops which were formerly hardly
grown or consumed in Britain. Cucumbers are extensively grown in the
traditional glasshouse area in the Lee Valley to the north of London. Mush¬
rooms, whose farmgate value is forecast at over £23 million for 1973-74, are
grown in specially constructed sheds in several parts of the country. Produc¬
tion in Northern Ireland, in particular, is steadily increasing each year.
Bulbs and hardy nursery stock each occupied some 18,000 acres (7,300
hectares) in June 1973; flowers in the open took 4,000 acres (1,620 hectares).
Many nurseries concentrate on the production of plants in containers for sale
through the garden centres which have been established on the outskirts of
many towns.
Cut flowers are grown and bulbs cultivated in many areas but particularly
in the Holland area of Lincolnshire, Norfolk, the east of Scotland, Cornwall
and in the Isles of Scilly where more than 50 per cent of the cultivable land is
devoted to bulbs which flower there from November to May.
Vegetables and outdoor salad crops are grown in the traditional areas of the
Thames Valley, north Kent, Vale of Evesham, south Lancashire and West
Yorkshire, but newer areas, especially suited through soil type or climate to
production of a particular crop, have come into prominence. West Cornwall,
south Devon, Dyfed and Kent send winter cauliflowers and spring cabbage
to most urban markets while almost half the summer and autumn cauliflowers
come from the intensive horticultural holdings in Lincolnshire. The light soils
of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire are especially suitable for carrots and onions,
and the Holland area of Lincolnshire accounts for just over a quarter of the
onion acreage. Brussels sprouts are grown extensively in Bedfordshire; their
production has also extended from the Vale of Evesham into Gloucestershire
and well up the east coast of England wherever freezing factories are sited for
the processing of fish as well as vegetables. Peas and dwarf beans are largely
sold frozen, canned or dried and so are grown close to factories in the east of
England and in Scotland. Celery is mainly grown on the deep soils of south¬
east Lancashire, Norfolk and the fens of Cambridgeshire. Nearly three-quarters
of the early rhubarb is produced in West Yorkshire, where plants grown in the
open are then forced in unlit sheds.
Hops for the brewing industry are grown in Kent, East Sussex, Hampshire,
Berkshire, Surrey, Hereford and Worcester. They occupy only about 17,000
acres (6,800 hectares) but have a very high yield per acre and value by weight.
Britain now produces just over half of its total food requirements or nearly
70 per cent of those supplies that can be produced in temperate climates.

Home production of the principal foods is shown as a percentage by weight
of total supplies in Table 24. Table 25 shows how the level of the main food
supplies passing into consumption has changed since the end of war-time
rationing. Rising living standards have led to increased consumption of high
protein foods. More recently the pattern of food consumption has tended to
stabilise but with a more pronounced trend towards partly prepared and
‘convenience’ foods.

r 973-74. The figures given in Table 26 show that Britain’s farming is pre¬
dominantly based on livestock enterprises. Over seven-tenths of total farm
output is in the form of livestock or livestock products.
Of all farm expenses, purchased feedingstuffs amount to nearly two-fifths,
wages to nearly one-fifth and machinery (including depreciation) and equip¬
ment to nearly one-fifth. Since i960 male agricultural earnings have more than
doubled, offsetting the manpower economies made possible by mechanisation
and larger farms, while labour productivity has risen by about 6 per cent a
year since 1964-65.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.
In 1973 provisional ‘fixed capital’ totalling £213 million was added to the
value of buildings and works and £219 million was invested in new plant,
machinery and vehicles. The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the
farms is provided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an important source of
outside capital, both fixed and working; about two-thirds of the total bank
advances to agriculture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural
merchants are also an important source of short-term credit. Mortgage loans
form the chief source of long-term credit and are provided by specialised
financial institutions (see p. 290) and private sources.
Accounts of some 3,000 farms in Britain, collected by agricultural economists
in 1973, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging from about £7
per acre (£17-3 per hectare) on hill farms with extensive rough grazings to over
£100 per acre (£247 per hectare) on some lowland farms. On all types of farm
investment in machinery is a heavy item: on dairy and arable farms it averages

about ^20 per acre (£50 per hectare); on stock-rearing farms it may amount to
£8 per acre (£20 per hectare).
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 506,000
tractors in 1973 or one to every 35 acres (14-2 hectares) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements now characterise arable farming; and some 60,000
combine harvesters were in use in 1973. A wide variety of machines for
harvesting and preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are
installed on all except the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply and
accompanying equipment. There are about 1,700 farmers’ machinery syndi¬
cates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment without
tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out by
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering.
The range of net incomes between individual farms is very wide, varying with
the type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the occupier.
The average net income for farms in England and Wales of different types is
generally within the range of £20 to £40 per acre (^49 to -£98 per hectare) with
the exception of pig and poultry farms and horticultural holdings, which are
more intensive in their use of land. Net income per acre on dairy and arable
farms has nearly always been higher than on stock-rearing farms, which are
generally larger than the other types and are situated on poorer land.
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers; for England and Wales the Minister of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales, for Scotland
the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland. The Advisory Council for Agriculture and Horti¬
culture in England and Wales exists to provide the Minister and his depart¬
ment with independent advice on any agricultural or horticultural subjects
remitted to it.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food operates through func¬
tional divisions. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly
through its local offices, grouped in England in regions, with regional man¬
agers. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary with similar
functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.
In 1966 an Economic Development Committee for agriculture was estab¬
lished, comprising representatives of farmers, workers and landowners, as well
as official and independent members.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission (see p. 291) and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the
conservation and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy. It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for which it acts as agent in the administra¬
tion in Northern Ireland of United Kingdom agricultural schemes.
Britain began to take part in the European Community system of agricultural
support under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on 1st February 1973.
The Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce was set up in 1972 to

administer the system; although administratively separate from the agricul¬
tural departments, the board maintains close working links with them and is
responsible to the agricultural ministers, who remain responsible for policy.
In February each year, the agricultural ministers review the economic condi¬
tion and prospects of the industry in consultation with representatives of
agricultural producers (in practice, the three farmers’ unions in Britain). They
consider such factors as production trends and market requirements, world
market prospects, the cost of subsidies, income trend in the industry as a
whole, the increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in production
costs. The conclusions drawn from the review form the background for the
determination of guaranteed prices in Britain and contribute towards the
formulation of policy in respect of the CAP and of other aspects of the Com¬
munity support system.
The cost of government support to the industry in 1973-74 is estimated at
£309 million. Expenditure under the CAP arrangements is estimated at about
^102 million, of which some £83 million is likely to be reimbursed from the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA).
The objectives of the CAP are to increase agricultural productivity and earn¬
ings, to stabilise markets and to provide adequate supplies at reasonable prices
to the consumer. For most commodities there is free trade within the Com¬
munity with a common system of variable levies to regulate imports from third
countries, and common price levels within the Community designed to give
producers an adequate return from the market. For these products market
prices are maintained by variable import levies which keep import prices up to
a minimum or ‘threshold’ price, while in most cases the internal market is
supported at an intervention price, slightly below the threshold price, at
which any surpluses are bought by the Community’s agricultural fund.
Britain has introduced intervention prices which will be gradually increased to
full Community levels over the five-year transitional period. During this
period there will be free trade between Britain and the other Community
members in the main agricultural products subject to arrangements to com¬
pensate for the differences in price levels and currency values. For fresh fruits
and vegetables the market organisation is similar, although third country trade
is subject to a common customs tariff and not to variable import levies. Items
of particular importance to Community producers are covered by a market
intervention system and a form of minimum import prices.
The principal tasks of the Intervention Board in administering this system
are the issue and control of export/import licences and the payment of
export and import refunds; market support for certain commodities, in¬
cluding support buying, aids to private storage and the payment of denaturing
premiums. The board also pays the minor Community production and pro¬
ducer subsidies not administered by the agricultural departments.
In the light of the Annual Review the agricultural ministers determine guaran¬
teed prices for the coming year for cereals, potatoes, fat sheep, fat pigs, milk
and wool. By the end of the transitional period (31st December 1977) the
guarantees for all commodities for which the Community has a common
market organisation will have been ended. The guarantee for eggs ended on
30th March 1974 and that for sugar beet on 30th June 1974.
The guarantee system operates by means of deficiency payments to stabilise
Other Grants
and Subsidies
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 289
prices to farmers at appropriate levels. These payments make up the deficit
between the open market price of a commodity and the price guaranteed by
the Government.
For cereals payment is made by the agricultural departments on the
acreage harvested. Deficiency payments for fatstock are made weekly to
producers on certified sales on a liveweight or deadweight basis.
For milk and wool in the United Kingdom, potatoes in Great Britain and fat
pigs in Northern Ireland, the Government operates the guarantee through the
appropriate marketing boards which take account of any payments from or to
the Government in deciding what to pay producers for their produce. In the
case of milk there are five boards; the Government pays full guaranteed price
on a ‘standard quantity’, which for 1974-75 will be broadly the same as total
production. Any milk produced in excess of this would be sold for manufac¬
turing and the returns from these two sources averaged by the boards to give
the ‘pool price’ paid to producers. Recent government decisions to subsidise
the retail price have resulted in a deficit which is being met by the Exchequer.
For potatoes, ministers fix each year a target acreage designed to achieve self-
sufficiency. In Great Britain the Potato Marketing Board ensures, as far as
possible, that this acreage is planted and undertakes support buying of any
surplus, re-selling as much as possible for stockfeed. In Northern Ireland the
Department of Agriculture undertakes any support measures. Most of the cost
is met by the Government.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to fix in
advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality, after
making allowance for the board’s marketing costs.
The British Sugar Corporation Ltd. contracts to buy sugar beet from an
acreage agreed with the National Farmers’ Union. For the 1974 crop this was
488,000 acres (197,500 hectares). For the beet which makes sugar within its
maximum quota under the CAP (974,400 long tons [990,000 tonnes] of refined
sugar in 1974-75), the corporation must pay not less than the CAP minimum
prices. Any additional sugar must, except in case of shortage, be exported
outside the European Community and the price paid will reflect prices on the
world market.
Under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA) the Government is
committed to take certain quantities of sugar annually from Commonwealth
exporters, mostly in developing countries, at a price negotiated periodically.
The sugar is bought by the Sugar Board on the Government’s behalf and sold
to refiners at the ruling world price. On import into Britain the sugar is
adjusted to a fixed price so as not to prejudice the marketing of Community
sugar. The CSA is due to expire at the end of 1974 and to be replaced by
arrangements negotiated between the European Community and the develop¬
ing countries concerned.
The relative importance of the price guarantees has declined in recent
years. The Government does, however, offer to farmers a wide range of other
inducements to increase productivity. The cost amounted to £195 million in
1973-74 and is estimated at £184 million in 1974-75. Of the total for 1974
-75 some £94 million was provided to maintain breeding herds of cattle
and sheep, particularly in upland areas and to retain calves suitable for beef
production.
Agreement was reached under the CAP in 1974 for Britain to introduce
certain special consumer and producer subsidies. The cost of the producer
290
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
subsidies over a full year for beef and pigmeat is estimated at ^38 million and
£30 million respectively.
Grants are available under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme 1973 towards
capital expenditure incurred on a wide range of work and facilities, such as farm
buildings, farm waste disposal systems, the supply of gas and electricity, and
field drainage (any expenditure in respect of egg and poultry enterprises is in¬
eligible for grant and there are special limitations on grant aid for pig enter¬
prises). The standard rate of grant is 20 per cent but for field drainage the
maximum rate is 55 per cent on lowland farms. Under the Farm Capital Grant
Scheme 1970, which remains in operation for certain hill land applications,
the rate for field drainage is 70 per cent and for land improvement 50 per cent.
The estimated cost in 1974-75 of grants under the two schemes and earlier
schemes which they have replaced is £777 million. The Farm and Horti¬
culture Development Scheme, which is assisted from FEOGA funds, makes
grants available for farmers and growers where income per labour unit is below
the average level in non-agricultural industry and can be raised to that level
by a programme of investment. Another form of assistance for the modernisa¬
tion and improvement of horticulture is the Horticulture Capital Grant
Scheme, through which the Government provides grants of 15 or 25 per cent
for horticultural investment. Nationally financed grants for horticulture are
expected to cost some £7-3 million in 1974-75. addition, the Apple and
Pear Growers (Special Payments) Scheme provides for payments to com¬
mercial producers who wish to give up growing apples and pears. The esti¬
mated cost of this scheme for 1974-75 is j£500>000-
To promote the improvement of farm structure, grants are available to
farmers who carry out approved amalgamations to farms or expand com¬
mercial units and to outgoers who give up their holdings for this purpose. The
cost of these grants in 1974-75 is estimated to be .£3 *6 million.
In 1973 the Community’s scheme for subsidising conversion from dairying
to beef cattle or sheep came into effect.
The FEOGA also provides grants for certain substantial projects that
promote the objectives of the CAP.

ASSISTANCE
AND ACTION
Agricultural
Credit
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
land and buildings is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. whose funds are derived mainly from public issues of stock, with some
government support. Loans for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural
land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corpora¬
tion Ltd. which works on a similar financial basis to the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation Ltd.
Loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and buildings are
also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement Company.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Department of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds. Short-term finance for agricultural machinery is arranged on a
hire purchase basis, whilst medium- or long-term loans are arranged for such
purposes as the purchase of livestock, the erection and improvement of farm
buildings and farm dwellings, and the purchase of land for amalgamation and
subsequent restructuring
The Government can make loans in Great Britain to help finance the pur¬
chase of land acquired for approved amalgamations of small farms and appro¬
ved remodelling expenditure. These loans may be granted up to 90 per cent
(100 per cent for certain small amalgamations) of the valuation of the com-

bined unit determined by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd. in
England and Wales and the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.
in Scotland, which act as the Government’s agents.
In England and Wales, about 10,700 smallholdings are provided by local
authorities and about 900 lettable holdings by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. For financial assistance in improving smallholdings,
authorities can obtain the amalgamation and capital grants available to farmers
generally. The minister and local authorities may make loans of up to 75 per
cent of required working capital to their smallholding tenants.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 416,000 acres (168,000
hectares) of land settlement estates, comprising some 3,080 crofts and holdings.
In the seven Scottish crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Orkney,
Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland and Shetland—much of the land is held by
crofters or tenants whose holdings are generally either rented at a cost of not
more than ^50 a year or have an area not exceeding 75 acres (30 hectares).
The Crofters Commission, with headquarters in Inverness, is responsible
for the administration and regulation of crofting. Its functions are to re¬
organise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to promote the
interests of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to crofting. The
commission’s statutory powers include supervising the letting of crofts and
collaborating with other organisations whose activities affect crofting interests.
It also acts as the Secretary of State’s agent in administering grants to crofters
for cropping and land improvement.
On 1st April 1974, responsibility for land drainage (including flood preven¬
tion) in England and Wales was transferred from the former river authorities
and catchment boards to ten new regional water authorities. There are no com¬
parable authorities in Scotland, where arterial drainage of agricultural land is
the owners’ responsibility.
The work of the water authorities includes, in both urban and agricultural
areas, the improvement of land drainage, the prevention of inland flooding,
and the construction and maintenance of defences to protect low-lying coastal
areas from tidal flooding. Most of the funds needed for this work are obtained
from local authorities, but the Government pays grants toward the cost of im¬
provement schemes varying from 10 per cent to 80 per cent according to the
financial position of the authority, with an additional premium for sea defence
works.
Within the water authority areas, in low-lying areas where there are special
local problems of land drainage, there are about 320 internal drainage districts
administered by internal drainage boards who carry out work for the special
benefit and protection of their districts. These boards finance their work from
drainage rates levied on owners and occupiers. They also receive Government
grant at a flat rate of 50 per cent for improvement schemes.
Local authorities in England and Wales also have general land drainage
powers and may receive government grant of between 20 per cent and 50 per
cent of the cost of improvement work. In Scotland 60 per cent grants (70 per
cent if for the benefit of hill land) are available to owners or occupiers of
agricultural land.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is the drainage authority

for watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or minor water¬
courses and also has responsibility for urban drainage.
In Great Britain more than half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms are
owner-occupied. In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and
tenants and to eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of
landlord and tenant relationships has been written into legislation.
Legislation provides for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings, to continue in force from year to year until
terminated by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can
contest it by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes in¬
operative unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and
Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land
Court) that his claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate manage¬
ment or good husbandry or that the land is required for certain specified
purposes.
There is a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on termina¬
tion of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and
tenant and may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing agreement, by
arbitration.
Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private trade channels,
through producers’ co-operatives or through marketing boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 or Northern Ireland legislation. The
practice of selling under contract is growing. The marketing boards are
producers’ organisations with statutory powers to regulate the marketing of
particular products. The schemes under which they are constituted and
operate must be approved by Parliament and, except in Northern Ireland,
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most board members are elected by the
producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or ministers con¬
cerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other interests
affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which are sole
buyers of the regulated product from all producers not specially exempted or
those which exercise a comparable influence by controlling all contracts
between producers and first buyers; and, secondly, boards which maintain
only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving producers free other¬
wise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for hops, milk and wool and
the Northern Ireland pigs and seed potato boards fall into the first category
and the Potato Board into the second.
For certain other commodities there are broadly based organisations
representing producer, distributor and independent interests.
The Home-Grown Cereals Authority was set up to improve the marketing
of home-grown cereals. It provides market intelligence and promotes research
and development of value to the cereals market. It also acts as agent for the
Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce in respect of the support buying,
storage and disposal of cereals and oilseed rape.
The Meat and Livestock Commission is charged with improving the pro¬
duction, marketing and distribution of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It
has a range of executive functions extending from breeding to retail distribu¬
tion, including acting as agent for the Intervention Board. It is not empowered
to trade in either livestock or meat.
The Eggs Authority, which represents the industry and consumers, was set

up with the general duty of improving the marketing of eggs. It provides market
intelligence, carries out promotional work and undertakes research and
development projects.
Grants of up to one-third are available for the modernisation of major
wholesale horticultural markets; Covent Garden is being moved to a new site,
which is under construction, in south London.
Under the CAP a wide range of fresh horticultural produce and also cut
flowers and flowering bulbs are subject to common quality standards which,
with certain minor exceptions, apply at all stages of distribution. The Com¬
munity standards apply to all produce entering Britain. For British produce
sold on the domestic market they are being phased in over a two-year period
ending on 1st February 1975.
Community regulations prescribe grades consisting of a range of up to four
classes and specify requirements concerning colour, sizing, etc., and relating to
packing, presentation and labelling. All fruit and vegetables subject to the
standards which are exported from or imported into the Community must meet
the requirements of at least Class II.
The Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation was
established to promote and develop co-operation in agriculture and horticul¬
ture and to administer a scheme of grants. The Agricultural and Horticultural
Co-operation Scheme 1971 provides grants for co-operative production and
marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce, including capital grants
on similar terms as are available under the schemes for individual producers
(see p. 290). The Federation of Agricultural Co-operatives represents British
co-operatives both in Britain and in the Community.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
practising veterinary surgeon. Control of animal disease nationally in accord¬
ance with the Government’s policy is the responsibility of the State Veterinary
Service, centred on London and Edinburgh, which is incorporated in the uni¬
fied Agricultural Development and Advisory Service. The Veterinary Service
is also responsible for the administration of legislation providing for the wel¬
fare of farm livestock.
For many years Great Britain has been free from many serious animal
diseases including rinderpest, contagious bovine pleuro pneumonia, sheep pox,
glanders and rabies, except for two isolated cases of rabies in imported dogs
in 1969-70. Sheep scab, eradicated in 1952, reappeared in 1973: control
measures reduced the disease to a low level by the end of the year. The
campaign to eradicate swine fever was successfully completed in 1966 and
although three cases of the disease occurred in 1971 the infection was quickly
eliminated. An epidemic of a previously unknown swine vesicular disease
began in December 1972; it is being combated by a stringent slaughter policy.
A major epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease was experienced in 1967-68 but
was successfully eradicated. In i960 the whole of Britain became a bovine
tuberculosis attested area. The incidence of the disease is now very low; cattle
(except for certain categories) are tested at regular intervals and reactors to the
test are slaughtered, compensation being paid to the owners. Voluntary
schemes for the eradication of brucellosis have been in operation since 1967;
compulsory eradication on an area basis began in 1972. Newcastle Disease
(fowl pest) which had declined considerably since 1963, reappeared in serious
epidemic proportions in a series of outbreaks in 1970 and early 1971 in
England and Wales and then declined again to a low level.
294 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The work of the service is backed by the extensive facilities of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and those of its subsidiary
laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 24 investiga¬
tion centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales. These
centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on disease
problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is provided by
the investigation centres of the three Scottish agricultural colleges.
In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to those
in Great Britain but are administered separately by the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland. Animal health control policies and the
geographical situation have kept the country free from nearly all the major
epizootic diseases, including swine vesicular disease. A Brucellosis Eradica¬
tion Scheme has been successfully carried out and in December 1971 Northern
Ireland was declared a brucellosis-free country. The full-time veterinary
service is supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory at Stormont,
Belfast.
Plants The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are
responsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from
abroad. They also issue the health certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material imported from Britain. Voluntary certification
schemes are operated to encourage the development of healthy vigorous and
true-to-type planting stocks. The Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden,
Hertfordshire, and the Agricultural Scientific Services Station, East Craigs,
Edinburgh, provide scientific and technical advice on which statutory controls
and certification schemes are based.
Pests and Storage The Ministry of Agriculture’s Pest Infestation Control Laboratory provides
scientific and technical advice on harmful mammals and birds and on insects,
mites and moulds associated with grain and other stored food products. The
laboratory’s headquarters is at Slough, Berkshire, where storage problems are
studied; vertebrate pests are studied at Tolworth, Surrey, and Worplesdon,
Surrey. The laboratory works closely with Regional Pest Officers who advise
farmers, local authorities and others on control techniques.
Agricultural Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
Chemicals pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Regulations pro¬
vide protection for workers using the more toxic chemicals. The voluntary
Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme ensures that new pesticides intended for
use in agriculture and the home garden, forestry and food storage, or new
methods of using existing pesticides, are not introduced until enough experi¬
mental work has been done on their possible hazards (including those of users,
consumers of treated produce, livestock or domestic animals and wild life) to
allow the Government to make recommendations for their safe use. Products
cleared for safety under the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme may then be
submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme for efficiency
approval. The purpose of this scheme is to enable users and advisers to choose
efficient proprietary brands of agricultural chemicals.
A key role in the administration of the safety scheme is played by the
Government’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals
which also reports on topics of current concern. In 1969 it concluded that there
was no evidence that the use of certain persistent organochlorine pesticides

(including DDT, aldrin and dieldrin) had any adverse effects on human beings,
but it is recommended that certain uses of these chemicals for which adequate,
less persistent alternatives were available should cease in order to reduce
amounts of them in the environment. This recommendation was implemented
during 1971.
The Medicines Act 1968 provides through a system of licensing for the control
of the manufacture, sale and supply of both human and veterinary medicinal
products (including those used in animal feedingstuffs). These controls are
being brought into operation in stages. The licensing authority (the British
health and agricultural ministers) is advised by the Medicines Commission,
the Veterinary Products Committee, on the safety, quality and efficacy of
veterinary medicinal products, and by other expert licensing committees.
Until the Medicines Act is fully in operation, existing controls restricting the
use of certain antibiotics in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine will be
kept in force.
The Safety Inspectors of the agricultural departments advise farmers and
workers about safety, including their obligations under the Agriculture (Safety,
Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956 and regulations made under it; these
cover such matters as the guarding of field and stationary machinery, the safe¬
guarding of work-places, and the fitting of safety cabs to tractors.
In England and Wales technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural
matters is available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which operates mainly from the ministry’s regional and
divisional offices. The service provides free and impartial advice to landowners,
farmers and growers, but charges are made for certain laboratory and other
services, such as drainage design work. When possible the ADAS concen¬
trates more on group than individual advice.
In Scotland the agricultural advisory service is provided by the three
regional independent colleges which are financed almost entirely by public
funds. The nature of service is similar to that provided by the ADAS and
covers all branches of advice.
Advisory work in Northern Ireland is under the direction of the Chief
Inspector of the Department of Agriculture and Advisory Centres are located
in the main provincial towns. The resources of the agricultural colleges, the
research centres and the specialist divisions of the department are available to
the advisory service.
Agricultural research and development in Britain, including that carried out
by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and the universities, is men¬
tioned on p. 404. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carries out
research and development at its own laboratories and on the 22 experimental
farms and horticulture stations operated by ADAS, and has funds which are
used to commission work from the ARC, the Natural Environment Research
Council and outside research organisations. In England and Wales, research
in agricultural economics is undertaken by 12 university departments of
agricultural economics. Ten of these conduct work on farm incomes and the
economics of particular products for the ministry (see p. 286). In Scotland,
agricultural economists are on the staff of the three agricultural colleges and
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.

Agricultural
Education and
Training
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture has an Economics and
Statistics Division and eight other research divisions.
Eleven universities in England and Wales, three in Scotland and one in
Northern Ireland provide degree and postgraduate courses in agriculture or
agricultural sciences. The National College of Agricultural Engineering at
Silsoe, Bedfordshire, offers degree and postgraduate courses. Sandwich courses
leading to a Higher National Diploma are available at eight agricultural
colleges in England and Wales and there are nearly 50 local authority and
other agricultural colleges providing full-time courses on different aspects of
agriculture, horticulture, forestry and farm management. A centre for Euro¬
pean agricultural studies is based at London University’s Wye College at
Ashford. In Scotland the three agricultural colleges which provide the advisory
services are also teaching establishments, associated with the agricultural
departments of the neighbouring universities. They mainly provide sandwich
courses leading to Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas, post-diploma
courses and certain short courses. In Northern Ireland degree courses in
agriculture and food science are provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Courses below this level are provided at three residential colleges run by the
Department of Agriculture.
Local education authorities throughout Britain provide full-time, block-
release, day-release and other part-time courses for farmers, farm workers and
horticulturists, as well as an advisory service for domestic producers.
The Agricultural Training Board, established under the Industrial Training
Act, provides a training advisory service and organises training courses in
agricultural and horticultural subjects. The board pays grants towards the
cost of career training for new entrants, for attendance at approved short
courses, training groups and schemes of training at places of work for those
already engaged in the industry.
FISHERIES
The industry falls into three main divisions, concerned respectively with white
fish, herring and shellfish. The major element of the catch (about 78 per cent
by weight) is white fish: the catches of herring comprise about 15 per cent
and shellfish 7 per cent of the total catch. The principal white fish (in terms of
value) are demersal species which live near the sea bed, such as cod, haddock,
plaice, coalfish (saithe), whiting, soles and skate. The pelagic species live mainly
in midwater or near the surface: they include herring, sprats and mackerel, of
which herring is the most important and constitutes a separate fishery. Shell¬
fish include Crustacea (such as lobsters, nephrops and crabs) and molluscs
(such as escallops, mussels, cockles, queens and oysters).
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups: the
distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The distant
waters are those round Iceland, Greenland, Bear Island, the north coast of
Norway, the Barents Sea and in the west Atlantic; the middle water grounds
lie around the Faroe Islands and Rockall; and the near water grounds are those
in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around Britain. The
herring fishing grounds are mainly in Scottish waters. The inshore waters also
yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
British fishermen have the exclusive right of fishing in the coastal belt
around Britain out to the six-mile limit. Under the terms of the Treaty of
Accession to the European Community, vessels registered in member states

can fish within certain areas of the 6-12 mile (Q'y-iQ’S km) belt. A number of
European countries also enjoy ‘historic rights’, which allow them to fish for
designated species in those areas of the belt where they had traditionally
fished before 1964, when the limits for Britain were extended to 12 miles.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, North Shields, Lowestoft and Milford Haven. In Scotland the chief
centres for white fish are Aberdeen, Granton, Peterhead, the Moray Firth, the
west coast and Shetland Islands; herring landings are made mainly at the east
coast port of Fraserburgh, the west coast ports of Stornoway, Ullapool,
Mallaig, Oban and Ayr and in the Shetland Islands. In Northern Ireland the
main fishing ports are Kilkeel, Portavogie and Ardglass.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining and ring
netting. Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant and near
waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for catching demersal
fish all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the Minches, the Firth of
Clyde and the Irish Sea. There are about 460 Scottish seiners, and about 195
operating from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring based
on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland and the north-east coast ports
of England. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of Scotland, in
the Isle of Man area and off southern Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland,
north-east England and in the Irish Sea there are valuable catches of nephrops
(‘Norway lobsters’ or Dublin Bay prawns).
Distant water trawlers, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleet-
wood, number about 168. They are over 140 feet (42*5 metres) in length and
most of them make voyages lasting from 17 to 40 days to fishing grounds off
Iceland, in the Arctic Circle, Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland and the
Norway coast. Freezer trawlers and factory ships, which spend from one to
six months at sea and freeze much or all of their catch, in some cases as
fillets, have become an important part of the distant water fleet in recent years
and number about 46. Excluding seiners, there are about 325 near and middle
water vessels of between 80 and 140 feet (24-5 and 42-5 metres) long and most
of them work nearer home, making voyages lasting from a few days up to more
than two weeks, although some of the larger vessels fish regularly off the
Faroes and seasonally as far afield as Iceland. Included in the near water group
are vessels engaged in fishing for herring which normally make daily landings.
The inshore group consists of some 1,400 vessels of over 40 feet (12-3 metres)
and over 4,000 smaller vessels, many of which do not fish regularly. The
majority are seldom at sea for longer than two or three days and more usually
make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land, although some seiners
operate for eight days or more.
In the British fishing industry in 1973 there were about 18,500 fishermen
in regular employment and some 4,200 occasionally employed; about two-
fifths of the former and one-third of the latter were from Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 600 regular fishermen and 200 part-time.

fishing vessels totalled 997,000 tons (652,000 tons of demersal fish, 275,000
tons of pelagic and 70,000 tons of shellfish), valued at £152-2 million. Cod
accounted for 47 per cent of the total value of demersal and pelagic fish landed
by British vessels; haddock (20 per cent) and plaice (7 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Imports of all fresh, frozen and cured fish and shellfish totalled 125,000 tons
valued at nearly £57 million. Imports of canned and preserved fish and shell¬
fish amounted to 80,000 tons valued at nearly £74 million. Imports of fish meal
amounted to 258,000 tons, worth £51 million, and those of fish oils to 215,000
tons, worth over £27 million. Exports and re-exports of fish and fish products
amounted to 184,000 tons and were worth over £46 million.
Weekly disposals of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and
imported canned fish) in Britain averaged about 14,000 tons landed weight in
1973. Total fish consumption, which has declined from its peak of 28*7 lb.
(13 kg.) per head in 1948 on an edible weight basis, was running at a level of
approximately 17-6 lb. (7*9 kg.) a head in 1973. Home production provided
about 85 per cent of supplies.
Processing and packaging of fish are the subject of continuing research and
development. The growth of quick-frozen fish production has altered radically
the structure of the industry. With the increase in quick-freezing (which now
processes just over a quarter of all white fish landings), new export outlets have
opened up for white fish, which account for almost half the total exports of
fish and fish preparations. Experiments are being carried out in the catching
and processing, for human consumption and fish meal, of previously under¬
exploited species of fish of which large stocks are known to exist in the sea
adjacent to the British Isles.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and, to a much lesser extent, for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal in 1973 was 82,000 tons.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in a wide area around the British Isles outside exclusive
fishery limits. Within the limits drift netting and certain other methods are
prohibited off the coast of Scotland but are permitted under licence off Eng¬
land, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, where salmon fishing is a
private right, the main commercial methods are fixed nets on the coast out¬
side estuaries and sweep netting within estuaries and in rivers. Water authority
licences are required for the limited amount of estuary and river netting carried
out in England and Wales. In England and Wales the landed value of the
salmon catch is approximately £600,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to
about £2-4 million, and in Northern Ireland to some £300,000. In Northern
Ireland, eels worth £630,000 were captured in 1973 by long lines and by eel
nets placed in river weirs.
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate
Market in London, which handles about 180 tons a day, but other large cities
also have central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is through
wholesalers, located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell to inland
wholesalers as well as directly to retail outlets; the port wholesalers prepare the
fish for onward shipment. Fish lorries, including insulated and refrigerated
vehicles, transport the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, although
rail transport is still used from some ports. Retail sales are handled by fish-

mongers and fish friers; the latter use about a third of the landings of white
fish.
Trawler-owning companies have entered into the marketing and distribu¬
tive system. This process has been encouraged by the growing popularity of
quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold mainly by other retail outlets.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts administered by
the Department of Trade. Research is carried out by the fisheries departments.
From ist February 1973 the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy of
the European Community, based on the establishment of a common organisa¬
tion of the market and a common structural policy, have applied in Britain. The
common organisation of the market aims at assisting in the adaptation of
supplies to marketing requirements while ensuring, as far as possible, a
reasonable return to producers, by means of the establishment of a common
grading and price system, and common rules on competition. The responsi¬
bility for market organisation is placed largely in the hands of the industry
itself through producers’ organisations established on the initiative of the
industry. Tariff adjustments for intra-Community trade in fish and trade with
third countries are to follow the general agricultural timetable (see p. 288).
The common structural policy covers measures aimed at promoting the
harmonious and balanced development of the fishing industry and the rational
exploitation of resources. It covers access to waters under the jurisdiction of
member states, conservation in coastal waters and common measures for the
financing of the improvement of the structure of the fishing industry and the
provision of an equitable standard of living for those engaged in it.
The Herring Industry Board was set up to reorganise, develop and regulate
the herring industry and consists of a chairman and two other members, all
part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed jointly by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The board, whose activities are
financed partly by levies and licence fees and partly by government grants
and loans, is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, which repre¬
sents all sections of the industry and consumers.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry, including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distributing herring. The board administers the government grant and
loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels, and the improvement of existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain
loans from the board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under
80 feet in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st March
1974 about ^5*1 million in loans and £5’3 million in grants had been approved.
The function of the White Fish Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate
the white fish industry, and that of its Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland is to advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The authority is composed of a
300
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
chairman and six members, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Committee
of five members and a chairman who is a member of the authority; member¬
ship is by appropriate ministerial appointment. The White Fish Industry
Advisory Council, which represents the various interests of the fishing
industry, advises the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan schemes
for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improvement of
existing vessels. It administers loans for the purchase of nets and gear and
loans are made available to processors, co-operatives, etc., to acquire, recondi¬
tion or improve facilities. Up to 31st March 1974 about ^40 million in loans
and .£49 million in grants had been approved. Its other activities are financed
by levies on first-hand sales of most white fish, and a government grant to¬
wards research and development. In 1973 the Herring Industry Board and
White Fish Authority formed a unified administration for the expected
development of fisheries administration under the common fisheries policy.
FORESTRY
The estimated total area of woodland in Great Britain is 4-9 million acres
(1-98 million hectares), or about 8^ per cent of the total land area; nearly half
of the area is in England, two-fifths in Scotland, the remainder in Wales.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
1-94 million acres (0-78 million hectares) represents 40 per cent of the total.
The annual rate of productive forest expansion is currently about 50,000 acres
(20,000 hectares) by the commission mainly in Scotland, and a similar area by
private woodland owners. The commission’s programme includes consider¬
able planting in upland areas, and consists mainly of conifers because of the
difficult site conditions encountered and because over 90 per cent of industrial
demand which the commission is primarily charged with supplying is for
softwoods. The major species used are Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine, Scots
pine and Norway spruce. In the older woodlands and taking the country as a
whole, the most common coniferous trees are Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway
spruce and the larches; among the broadleaved, beech and oak occur widely.
Total employment in state and private forests was 22,000 in 1973 and a
further 12,000 were engaged in the transport and milling of home-grown
timber.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s consumption of wood and wood products, as only some 25
per cent of the commission’s woodlands are yet in production. Britain imports
92 per cent of its needs by volume and a higher proportion still by value, the
total import cost of wood and wood products including pulp and paper being
nearly £1,200 million in 1973, of which £670 million was for timber imports.
The Forestry The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
Commission promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the
and Forestry production and supply of timber in Great Britain. The commission consists of
Policy a part-time chairman, a full-time director general, three full-time executive
commissioners and five part-time commissioners. The commissioners comply
with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland has its own separate organisation (see p. 302). New policies,

AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
resulting from an earlier forestry review, were announced in 1973. In future,
alongside timber production, environmental and employment criteria are to
be the main objectives of forestry in Great Britain.
The commission’s total estate covers some 3 million acres (i*2 million
hectares) and includes 2-2 million acres (0-89 million hectares) of forest land,
of which nearly 1*9 million (078 million hectares) are under trees in 250
forests distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales. All these forests
are covered by management plans which provide for such work as planting,
road construction, thinning, fire protection and timber production, facilities
for public recreation, wildlife conservation and the landscaping of plantations.
Much of the Forestry Commission’s new planting in Scotland is in the
Highland counties, where poorer types of land, such as sour, peaty soil which
is unsuitable for agricultural purposes, are used, having become suitable for
forestry as a result of deep ploughing and fertilisation.
As more of its coniferous woods reach the production stage the commission,
as managers of the National Forestry Enterprise, has assumed an increasingly
important role as a timber seller and has encouraged the setting up of some 20
major new timber-using industries since the mid-1960s.
Production of felled and thinned timber from commission woodlands
amounted to i-6 million cubic metres in 1973-74. Some of this produce is
meeting traditional requirements of the coal mines but much is taken by the
paper pulp industry and by factories established to make chipboard, fibreboard
and wood wool.
The Forestry Fund was constituted under the 1919 Forestry Act; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
amounts voted annually by Parliament, together with the commission’s
receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources. In the period ending
31st March 1973, drawings from funds voted by Parliament amounted to
^15*4 million, and receipts were £12'2 million.
Privately owned woods comprise nearly 60 per cent of the total forest area in
Great Britain and contain most of the mature and semi-mature timber. The
size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few acres to several
thousand acres, and some 40 per cent of the private woodland area is in small
ownerships—that is, owners of up to about 250 acres (100 hectares).
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged by the pro¬
vision of grants. A single woodlands dedication scheme in 1974 replaced the
three earlier schemes. Under the new arrangements once-for-all planting
grants, based on acreage, are made available, in return for which owners accept
a continuing obligation to manage their woodlands in accordance with sound
forestry practice. There are premium rates of grant for planting hardwoods.
The Forestry Commission consults with the agricultural departments and
local planning authorities before administering grant aid for private forestry.
Woodland owners are represented, in their relations with the Forestry Com¬
mission, by the Forestry Committee of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the
work of two associations of woodland owners: the Timber Growers’ Organisa¬
tion (for owners in England and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners
Association.
Under the Forestry Act 1967, the Forestry Commissioners have set up for
Great Britain the Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee (HGTAC) to
advise on certain statutory functions, including promoting the interests of
302

forestry and the production and supply of timber. The HGTAC includes
representatives of associations of woodland owners, timber merchants, pro¬
cessors, and other major timber users and the trade unions, under an inde¬
pendent chairman. The HGTAC maintains a technical sub-committee to
advise it on subjects such as harvesting, transport and utilisation of home¬
grown timber.
The Forestry Commissioners also maintain National Committees for
England, Scotland and Wales, which act in an advisory capacity, particularly
on the social, recreational and amenity aspects of the commissioners’ activities
and relationships with other land users. The commissioners also maintain a
regional advisory committee for each conservancy, whose members represent
local amenity and planning interests as well as the forestry industry, and,
because of its special nature, a consultative panel for the New Forest.
Forestry education is the responsibility of the education departments. Degree
courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at four universities
(Aberdeen, Bangor, Edinburgh and Oxford) and supervisory level courses
are run at Newton Rigg, near Penrith in Cumbria.
The Forestry Training Council, whose membership is representative of
forestry employers (both commission and private) and the trade unions, the
education services, the forestry societies and the relevant industrial training
boards, makes recommendations to the industry for meeting requirements for
training and associated further education, and encourages co-operation at all
levels between the agencies and authorities concerned. The Furniture and
Timber Industry Training Board is concerned with training for private sector
employees in the home timber trade.
Research at the commission’s Southern Forest Research Station at Alice
Holt Lodge in Surrey is largely concerned with the study of hardwood trees,
especially in connection with lowland forests and landscaping and amenity
problems. Work at the Northern Research Station at Roslin near Edinburgh
is linked to the needs of forest management and upland forestry. Expenditure
on research work in Great Britain amounted to 1 *37 million in 1972-73. This
sum included grants for special forestry research work to various institutions
and to university departments including the Commonwealth Forestry Insti¬
tute at Oxford, which is also financed by the university, the Ministry of Over¬
seas Development and overseas governments. Research into the qualities of
home-grown timber is carried out by Princes Risborough Laboratory, and also
by grant-aided research associations.
The Department of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland. It
can acquire and manage land, and give financial and technical assistance to
private planting. It has introduced measures for the protection of all woodlands
against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. Over 157,000 acres (63,500 hectares) have been acquired, of which over
113,000 acres (45,700 hectares) have been planted.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and from
receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,600 people are em¬
ployed in the state forests. There are also about 36,000 acres (15,000 hectares)
of privately owned forests, and private planting is assisted by schemes for the
supply of young trees from the department’s nurseries at a low cost, by grants
towards the cost of the establishment and maintenance of plantations and by
free technical advice.
15 Transport and
Communications
Transport and communications accounted for 7 per cent of the employed
labour force in Great Britain in June 1973—some 1-5 million people. Of these,
465,000 employees were engaged in road passenger transport and road haulage
contracting, 223,000 in railways, 436,000 in postal services and telecommunica¬
tions, 77,000 in port and inland water transport, 88,000 in sea transport,
77,000 in air transport and 135,000 in other transport services and storage.
Transport and communications contribute nearly 9 per cent of the gross
national product and are responsible for a rather higher proportion of the
nation’s gross domestic fixed capital formation.
SEA TRANSPORT
SHIPPING Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over, some 10
per cent is registered in Britain, making the British merchant fleet, at 30-2
million gross tons, the third largest in active employment after those of Liberia
and Japan. The oil tanker fleet, at 14-1 million gross tons, is the world’s third
largest, and the ore and bulk carrier fleet, at 7 million gross tons, the fourth
largest.
The British fleet has grown steadily, particularly over the last few years;
since 1968 it has increased by 38 per cent, much of the new tonnage consisting
of purpose-built container, tanker and bulk carrier vessels. British shipping
meets severe international competition and, with the fleets of other traditional
maritime nations, encounters difficulties from practices such as flag dis¬
crimination and the use of ‘flags of convenience’.
Relations with The Department of Trade is the government department responsible for most
the Government matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant Shipping
Acts, it administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare, for
instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is
not overloaded; ensuring that standards of safety are observed in ship con¬
struction; ensuring the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and
radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline, professional standards,
health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the work which these respon¬
sibilities entail is carried out by the staff of the Marine Survey and Mercantile
Marine Offices at the ports. There is also a Registrar General of Shipping and
Seamen, in whose office at Cardiff a complete record of all British ships is kept.
The Merchant Navy Establishment Administration, an organisation managed
by the shipowners, records information on British seafarers actively employed
at sea. Overseas, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts are administered
by British Consuls and by officers of Commonwealth Governments.
1 One gross ton (g.t.) = xoo cubic feet (2'83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton (d.w.t.)
= 1 long ton (2,240 lb. or 1,016 kilogrammes). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity
of the enclosed space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which
a vessel can carry before submerging the load-line.

BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Much of the law relating to employment at sea has been brought up to date
under the Merchant Shipping Act 1970. Arrangements for the welfare and
safety of seamen have been improved and disciplinary provisions revised.
In June 1973, 28 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons and
over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 These ships are usually
employed as follows: 5‘6 million gross tons as foreign-going passenger and
cargo liners; 7*7 million gross tons as foreign-going tramps; 14 million gross
tons as foreign-going tankers; and 715,000 gross tons in coasting and trade with
ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades). Rapid technological change in
the merchant fleet is reflected in the current composition. Vessels are becoming
obsolete over a shorter period and as they do so are being replaced by larger
ships, with generally lower building costs per ton. Labour-saving devices,
greater speeds and faster turn-round facilities are stabilising operating costs.
The tendency to greater average size has been most marked in tankers and
dry bulk cargo ships. Vessels are specially built to carry ore and various kinds of
chemicals. Many ships have been designed to carry fully loaded road vehicles,
pallets and containers and the use of these on door-to-door journeys can result
in speedier, safer and cheaper carriage of a wide range of goods.
There were some 89,000 seamen employed by the merchant fleet in 1971,
according to a census of seamen, of whom some 55,000 were domiciled in
Britain.
The Department of Trade holds examinations for, and issues certificates of
competency to, ship’s officers as master, first mate and second mate of foreign-
going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class engineer
and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board ships in
these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Home Office on the results of an open examination.
A seaman may not be rated as AB (Able Seaman) in British registered ships
unless he holds a certificate of competency as AB granted by the Department
of Trade, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certificate a seaman must,
among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on deck, have
obtained a certificate of efficiency as lifeboatman and have passed a qualifying
examination. Seamen qualify by seniority and efficiency for promotion to the
rating of petty officer. Service as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of
admission to the examination for a second mate’s certificate.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies
of apprentices, cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations for
the various certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment of the majority of seafarers are nego¬
tiated by the National Maritime Board. Minimum wages and holidays with
pay are guaranteed for both officers and ratings. The Merchant Navy Estab¬
lished Service Scheme, introduced by the board in 1947, removed a great
deal of the uncertainty formerly associated with a seafaring life. Under the
latest scheme seafarers are employed either as ‘registered seafarers’ or they may
enter into a company service contract, for a minimum of one year, for employ¬
ment on the ships of a particular company. Registered seafarers receive special
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft, Ministry
of Defence vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries.

benefits between voyages in addition to the normal state benefits. The benefits
paid to company service contract seafarers must be at least equivalent to those
paid to registered seafarers.
Most of the foreign-going cargo liners, including container ships, owned and
registered in Britain, are operated by large groups. Many operate wide net¬
works of scheduled conventional or container services which, between them,
cover every ocean. Foreign-going tramp ships are operated by a large number
of private owners, some having only a small number of ships and some only
one ship. The greater part of the total tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies,
although there are a few important independent British tanker-owning
companies.
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 371) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety
and operational efficiency. It accepts responsibility for surveying and giving
technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of building, at
regular intervals during their service, and after casualties. A satisfactory
Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an underwriter that he may accept the
risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between the Register and the
Society of Lloyd’s.
The representative body speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) is the Chamber of Shipping of the
United Kingdom. The British Shipping Federation is the employers’ organisa¬
tion concerned with labour relations and the regulation of employment. The
two bodies are merging to form the General Council of British Shipping,
a national organisation representing the interests of British shipowners; it
becomes fully operative on 1st March 1975. Other organisations represent
companies specialising in a particular trade or type of cargo.
The British Shippers’ Council, formed in 1955, represents the shipping
interests of exporters and importers in matters of both national and inter¬
national concern.
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of the shipowners and seafarers’ unions and is responsible for negotiation
of wages and conditions of service.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a
series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates,
and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle
of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or
passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets from
time to time to review and revise existing rates and practices. Some of the
conferences are connected by rate agreements, or have joined together to form
wider groupings. There are about 100 conferences dealing with trade to and
from Britain.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market

for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet there to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world. In addition sale
and purchase of ships, chartering of aircraft and trade in certain commodities
are carried on there.
The Department of Trade’s responsibilities for safety include administration
of the Coastguard Service, and certain administrative functions concerning
lighthouses and pilotage. The department makes regulations to ensure safety
of navigation and to prevent oil pollution, and conducts enquiries into shipping
casualties and accidents.
The Coastguard Service co-ordinates search and rescue measures for vessels in
distress off the coasts of Britain, and gives direct assistance where appropriate.
There are some 550 regular coastguards and about 7,000 part-time auxiliary
coastguards. Constant watch is maintained all the year round at certain main
stations and where necessary at a number of others. During 1973 life-saving
action was taken on 4,811 occasions.
The Coastguard Service calls upon shipping, the lifeboats of the Royal
National Life-boat Institution, and Service aircraft to assist as necessary. It
may call upon the services of long-range civilian helicopters based at Aberdeen
in Scotland. The Royal National Life-boat Institution is supported entirely by
voluntary contributions, and depends for its operation on voluntary workers.
From its foundation in 1824 to the end of 1973 it saved 98,392 lives. Lifeboats
were launched 2,641 times in 1973 and rescued 1,757 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first
Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a board of Elder
Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. Lighthouses
in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the Northern
Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These authorities
control about 180 lighthouses, many minor lights and buoys, and a number of
lightships, some of which are being replaced by unattended sea marks or by
light towers.
Trinity House is the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 720 pilots in
41 districts in England and Wales, including London, Southampton and
Milford Haven. In some cases the harbour authority or local council is the
pilotage authority. In Britain there are 47 pilotage authorities for the 92
pilotage districts and over 1,600 licensed pilots.
Eevry day there are some 350 vessel movements, including up to 200 in peak
summer periods of cross-Channel ferries, in the Dover Strait, one of the most
congested seaways in the world. The first traffic separation scheme adopted
by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation (IMCO—a
United Nations agency with headquarters in London) was introduced in the
Dover Strait on a voluntary basis in 1967. It was revised, extended and made
mandatory in 1972, and now stretches from the Greenwich meridian in the
Channel as far as other separation schemes operating in the southern North
Sea. It consists of inshore traffic zones on each side of the Channel for coastal
shipping, and main traffic lanes in the centre. Britain and France operate radar
surveillance services which keep watch on ships not conforming to the traffic

separation scheme and broadcast navigational information to ships in the
Dover Strait. The two countries have joint plans to develop these services with
the establishment of further radar stations in the Dover Strait area.
The discharge of oil into British territorial waters was first restricted in 1922.
Britain is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of the
Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954. Amendments to the convention agreed upon
in 1969 prohibit the discharge of persistent oil or mixtures containing any oil
anywhere at sea except at a rate which has been shown not to cause harmful
pollution; no oil whatever may be discharged from cargo spaces of tankers
within 50 miles (80 kilometres) of land. Britain enforces these restrictions on
British registered ships through the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971.
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
1973, concluded in London, will eventually supersede the 1954 convention.
The Department of Trade is responsible for the prevention of oil pollution at
sea.
Dumping at sea is controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the appropriate departments in Scotland and Northern Ireland,
through the Dumping at Sea Act 1974 which gave statutory backing to
voluntary arrangements which had been operated for several years. The Act
enables Britain to ratify and implement the Oslo and London Conventions,
which permit dumping at sea on the basis of scientific criteria set out in annexes
to the conventions. Under the Act dumping is prohibited unless a licence has
been obtained from the appropriate department.
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 1,400 other undertakings engaged in various harbour operations, such as
stevedoring, towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port authorities are of four
main types: nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and statutory
companies. The present Government intends that the entire industry should
eventually be brought under public ownership and control.
Over a quarter of total port capacity is run by nationalised undertakings; the
majority of these ports, including Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Newport,
Cardiff and Swansea, are owned by the British Transport Docks Board. In
1973 shipping arrivals and departures at the board’s docks totalled over 137
million net registered tons (including fishing vessels) and total cargo handled
was 897 million tonnes. The British Railways Board controls certain ports,
which are largely used for the cross-Channel services of the railways (for
example, Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay at
Harwich) while the British Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester)
and Weston Point (Manchester).
The constitutions of public trust port authorities vary considerably. Tra¬
ditionally they consist of representatives of shippers, importers, exporters,
shipping companies, local authorities and trade unions. Examples of such
public trusts are the Port of London Authority, the Tees and Hartlepool Port
Authority, and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. The reconstitution of a
number of port trusts is in progress. The main features are fewer members, a
greater proportion of executive members and the appointment of non-executive
members by the Government. The Forth Ports Authority and the Ipswich
Port Authority have been reconstituted on these lines. Local authorities own
about one-third of Britain’s ports, including Bristol, Preston and Sunderland.
Port undertakings owned by statutory companies include Manchester, Liver¬
pool and Felixstowe. Many private ports deal with the traffic of individual

industrial firms in commodities such as petroleum, china clay and paper pulp.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and responsibili¬
ties set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the British
Ports Association which aims to further the common interests of port autho¬
rities in their relations with the Government, shipowners and traders.
The National Ports Council (NPC), set up as a statutory body under the
Harbours Act 1964, is financed by a levy on port authorities. It advises the
Government on major port developments and has various responsibilities in
relation to research, training, statistics and charges. It has encouraged the
amalgamation of harbour authorities in certain estuaries into single port
authorities, as on the Forth, Clyde and Tees.
Large-scale modernisation of the port transport industry has been taking place
in recent years, as a result both of the increase in Britain’s trade, especially
with other European countries, and of technological changes affecting sea¬
going traffic. The growing size of tankers and bulk carriers has necessitated
more deep-water berths, while development of mechanical handling methods,
packaging of general cargo, containers and ‘roll-on/roll-off’ services has created
a demand for new types of port facilities. There are some 72 lift-on and 76
roll-on berths in operation in Britain.
A major development at Tilbury, Port of London, costing £30 million over
a number of years, has provided 12 deep-water berths, four of them for
container traffic, and a riverside grain terminal. Another major scheme has
been the construction of the new £50 million Royal Seaforth dock complex at
Liverpool which provides ten deep-water berths including four container
berths, a grain terminal and refrigerated meat berth, and two timber berths.
A new dock under construction at Bristol at a cost of some ^20 million will
provide six berths and have the largest entrance lock in Britain; it is due to
open in 1975-76. Container facilities have been expanded at a cost of some
£14 million for the Far East traffic at Southampton, where a computer-linked
harbour surveillance and shipping information system has been installed to
provide radar and VHF radio coverage over 20 miles (32 kilometres) of port
area. Deep-sea container facilities have also been constructed at Felixstowe, the
Clyde, and Manchester. A £20 million deep-water harbour at Port Talbot,
south Wales, serves as an ore terminal for the British Steel Corporation. Other
ore terminals have been built at Redcar and Immingham and another is
planned at Hunterston on the Clyde. The discovery of oil in the North Sea has
resulted in major developments at harbours on the east coast of Scotland and
in the Shetland Islands to provide facilities for vessels servicing the drilling rigs.
About 80,000 people are employed in Britain’s port transport industry; of
these, 35,000 dockers, responsible for the physical and mechanical handling
of cargo, were registered with the National Dock Labour Board at the end of
1973-
The system of casual labour common among dock workers in the past has
gradually been superseded. In 1947 the National Dock Labour Board was
established to administer a scheme under which registered dock workers
received a minimum wage for attendance even when no work was available.
In 1967 each registered dock worker was placed in employment on a per¬
manent basis with an employer licensed by the port authority, under the
provisions of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966. In recent years there has been
a continuous decline in employment opportunities in the industry, due to

improvements in cargo-handling methods, and voluntary redundancy schemes
have been in operation since 1967 to encourage surplus workers to leave the
industry.
About 350 million tonnes of cargo a year pass through the ports of Great
Britain. Of this total, coastal traffic accounts for nearly 100 million tonnes
consisting mainly of petroleum and coal. Of over 200 million tonnes of imports
from overseas some 126 million tonnes consist of petroleum and petroleum
products. Manufactured goods form about two-fifths of exports.
A large proportion of the general cargo traffic through British ports is
handled by unitised transport methods in containers and roll-on goods
vehicles, which carried 22 million tonnes of goods in 1972. London, Dover,
Felixstowe, Southampton and Liverpool all handled large amounts.
Britain’s largest port is that of London. In 1973 some 57 million tonnes of
goods were handled, including 28-1 million tonnes of petroleum and 4-6
million tonnes of coal. Southampton is Britain’s second seaport by value of
trade, the chief port for ocean passenger traffic and the main trading port on
the south coast. In 1973 it handled 31-3 million tonnes of goods. It has the
advantages of deep water and double tides. Medway is an important port for
petroleum and petroleum products. Some of the ports in the South East and
East Anglia, particularly Dover, Felixstowe and Harwich, are growing rapidly
with modern facilities especially for roll-on/roll-off and container traffic.
Dover is Britain’s leading passenger port.
Liverpool is a very important export outlet, especially to countries outside
Europe and the Mediterranean. The inland port of Manchester, reached from
the Mersey via the 36-mile (58-kilometre) Manchester Ship Canal, exports
manufactured goods and chemicals.
The port of Tees and Hartlepool handles petroleum products, chemicals,
iron and steel, and iron ore. The port of Tyne and some other north-east coast
ports, such as Blyth and Sunderland, have an important outward trade in
coal. Grimsby and Hull are Britain’s two main fishing ports; with Immingham
they also serve the industrial areas of northern England and the Midlands,
especially in trade with Scandinavian and Baltic ports. Immingham handles
imports of iron ore and crude oil and exports of coal and petroleum products.
Milford Haven, handling 53 million tonnes a year, is Britain’s major oil port
and now Britain’s second seaport in terms of tonnage handled. Much of the
traffic through the other south Wales ports is connected with the local steel
industry—imports of iron ore and exports of iron and steel, and tinplate.
In Scotland the Clyde is the principal port, serving the central industrial
area; there is a crude oil terminal at Finnart. On the Forth, Grangemouth is
associated with petroleum, petro-chemicals and timber.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and with Larne handles
the main traffic across the Irish Sea.
Most of the oil tankers coming to Britain to discharge crude oil are berthed at
special tanker terminals owned and operated by the oil companies to serve
their own refineries.
British ports offer the deepest water access in Northern Europe for fully
laden tankers to pipe crude oil direct to refineries. Milford Haven can accom¬
modate fully laden vessels of up to 275,000 deadweight tons on all tides at five
private oil company terminals. Finnart on the Clyde will accept vessels of
325,000 deadweight tons; it is frequently used in lightening operations to

allow part-laden vessels to proceed with shallower draft to other ports in
Northern Europe. At Tetney Haven off the mouth of the Humber, fully laden
tankers discharge at Britain’s first offshore mooring monobuoy, a large buoy
anchored in deep water with a connecting pipeline to the shore. A single-buoy
deep-water mooring is under construction at Amlwch, Gwynedd, to accom¬
modate tankers up to 500,000 deadweight tons. A ^9 million crude oil terminal
to handle tankers of 250,000 deadweight tons is under construction at Hound
Point, near Edinburgh. The terminals are connected to the refineries by pipe¬
lines (see p. 263).
The hovercraft, a vehicle invented in Britain which rides on a cushion of air
over both land and water surfaces, has been in regular public passenger service
around the coasts of Britain since 1965. Services are run by several privately
owned firms including Hoverlloyd Ltd., which has a purpose-built hoverport
at Pegwell Bay in connection with its car and passenger ferries between
Ramsgate and Calais, and Hovertravel Ltd., which operates across the Solent
to the Isle of Wight and has a subsidiary which does training and charter work.
Two publicly owned bodies, the British Railways Board and the Scottish
Transport Group, have hovercraft interests. British Railways’ subsidiary,
British Rail Hovercraft Ltd. (‘Seaspeed’), was set up in 1966, and is the world’s
largest commercial hovercraft operator. It runs regular services across the
Channel between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and Calais, carrying
passengers and accompanied cars. It also operates two services across the
Solent, and takes on charter work. A privately operated hovercraft service
between Greenwich and Westminster is primarily intended for commuters; it
is being financially assisted by the Government and the Greater London
Council.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain is carried mainly by road.
However, rail, coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, pipelines and inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly bulk
goods. A small proportion of freight goes by air.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is publicly owned:
the railways, a large proportion of road passenger and some road haulage
services, most of the inland waterways and some of the vessels on them. Road
haulage is largely, and coastal shipping almost entirely, in the hands of private
enterprise.
In the third quarter of 1973 there were 17 million vehicles licensed for use
on the roads. Of these 13*5 million were motor cars, one million motor cycles,
scooters and mopeds and 1 *7 million road goods vehicles; about two-thirds of
the 77,000 public road passenger vehicles (excluding taxis) were publicly
owned. Private ownership of cars has been growing rapidly for many years and
the car is now the most popular form of travel within Great Britain.
In 1973 about 64 per cent of freight, in terms of ton-mileage,1 travelled by
road, 18 per cent by rail, 16 per cent by coastal shipping, and 2 per cent by
pipeline and inland waterway.
The railways first came under government direction during the first world
war, and afterwards some 130 private companies were amalgamated into four

British Railways. Under the Transport Act 1962 the British Railways Board
was set up and came into existence in 1963 with sole responsibility for managing
railway affairs.
Although the railway system was modernised and streamlined in the mid-
1960s the board’s financial position remained unsatisfactory and the 1968
Transport Act made far-reaching changes in its financial structure. The board’s
capital debt was reduced and a system of grants introduced to support specific
loss-making passenger services considered necessary for social and economic
reasons; about £91 million was so paid in 1973.
These measures helped the board to make an operating profit in 1969 and
1970, but its financial situation deteriorated in 1971 and 1972. In 1972 the
Government announced that the deficit would be met by grants while the
long-term future of the railways was reviewed (see below).
In 1973 the railway network operated by British Rail amounted to 11,326
route-miles (18,227 kilometres) of which 2,151 miles (3,462 kilometres) were
electrified. A total of 728 million passenger journeys was made and 194 million
tons of freight traffic carried by rail. Total railway receipts amounted to
£582 million (excluding grants). The board made a loss of ^51’6 million
following interest payments of £57’3 million. Capital expenditure amounted
to about £100 million. At the end of 1973 it employed 250,000 people and
operated 3,639 diesel and 333 electric locomotives, 3,468 diesel and 7,173
electric passenger multiple-unit vehicles, 7,152 passenger carriages and a fleet
of 248,700 freight vehicles. Several companies also own or lease rolling stock.
In recent years the most important developments have been the replacement
of steam by diesel and electric traction completed in 1968; the improvement
of inter-city passenger services with the emphasis on speed, reliability, com¬
fort and better train connections; and an increase in freight trainload traffic,
allowing higher speeds, and greater mechanisation in the carrying of coal and
other bulk commodities, and including containers.
In 1973 British Transport Hotels Ltd. owned 32 hotels of which it managed
31. It controls Travellers-Fare, responsible for catering facilities on trains and
at stations. British Rail’s Shipping and International Services division, which
carries more sea-going passengers than any other fleet in the world, operated a
fleet of 64 vessels in 1973, providing passenger and freight services on most of
the important routes between Britain and the Irish Republic and on the short-
sea routes to the continent of Europe, as well as on some domestic routes.
British Rail Hovercraft Ltd. runs regular hovercraft services (see p. 310). In
1973 British Rail Engineering Ltd. had 14 main workshops, employing about
32,400 people, mostly on the repair and construction of British locomotives,
rolling stock and containers, although some manufacturing work is done for
export.
The Railway Technical Centre at Derby employs about 2,000 people and
controls a comprehensive research and development programme costing over
j£4 million a year, half of which is met by direct government grants.
The board’s second five-year corporate plan was produced in 1972 and was
followed in 1973 by a comprehensive review of railway policy. Following this
the Government decided to retain and improve the railway network at roughly

its present size. Under the Railways Act 1974 a new system of government
support for the passenger network will replace the present system of grants for
loss-making services from 1st January 1975.
Further improvements to commuter and inter-city passenger services and
freight services will be made and the standards of track and signalling will be
raised to allow faster running speeds and higher levels of safety and operating
efficiency.
Although passenger route-mileage and rolling stock have been reduced since
1963, the number of passenger journeys has declined less and rolling stock is
used more intensively. This has been achieved during a period of substantial
growth in car ownership. Passenger services have been concentrated increas¬
ingly on the high-speed inter-city network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain, and on commuter routes in and around the large conurbations,
especially London and the South East. The board’s plans for inter-city
services include a programme to replace old passenger coaches by new air-
conditioned stock. The high speed train (HST) is due to enter regular
service on the route from London to Bristol and south Wales in 1977, operating
at a sustained speed of 125 mph (201 kph). Work is in progress on track
improvements and signalling, which already permit speeds of up to 100 mph
(161 kph) in certain sections. Development work is proceeding on an experi¬
mental advanced passenger train (APT), capable of speeds up to 155 mph
(250 kph). Train speeds of up to 100 mph (161 kph) are also possible on parts
of the London-Edinburgh line and the electrified west coast route from London
to Glasgow. This electrification scheme was the largest capital investment
project ever undertaken by the British Railways Board and included station
reconstruction, bridgeworks, new colour-light signalling and new rolling stock.
The first stage between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool was
completed in 1967 and led to an approximate increase of 150 per cent in
numbers of passengers. The second stage of the electrification scheme, an
extension of 235 route-miles (378 kilometres) to Glasgow, was completed in
May 1974.
Motorail services (carrying both passengers and their cars) have an annual
capacity of 125,000 cars on 40 services. Six new services were added during
1974.
The board’s proposals for commuter services include the development of new
multiple-unit trains to replace old stock. The first of these, the Prototype
Electro-Pneumatic Train, is being tested in the London area. Urban railway
projects include a scheme to electrify the north London commuter lines to
Royston. On Merseyside a £14 million scheme, due for completion in 1976,
will provide an extension of the Mersey underground railway in central
Liverpool and an .£11 million scheme to provide an underground link between
Liverpool’s main railway stations will be completed in 1977.
The most important freight commodities handled in 1973 were coal and coke
(99-4 million tons) and iron and steel (35 million tons). A decline in the
carriage of these products, particularly coal and coke, has been accompanied by
a small increase in other traffic, especially petroleum products, cars and motor
components, refuse, roadstone and construction materials, and containers.
The efficiency of freight operations is being improved as new types of
wagon are introduced with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds. The
board has begun a programme to concentrate freight traffic at fewer and
better equipped and sited marshalling yards and terminals. A computer-based
314 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
total operations processing system, allowing constant control of all consign¬
ments and freight train and wagon movements, was introduced in south-west
England in 1973 and will be extended to the whole of Great Britain by 1975.
The board is concentrating on traffic particularly suitable for carriage by rail,
especially long-distance and bulk trainload traffic, often between specialised
company terminals. Long-term contracts are in operation for the carriage of
cars, oil, china clay, milk, newspapers, grain, chemicals, coal, steel, refuse,
and sand and gravel aggregates. The ‘merry-go-round’ system, whereby trains
are loaded and discharged automatically while in motion, is being used in¬
creasingly where there are heavy flows of mineral traffic, such as the carriage
of coal to power stations and iron ore to steelworks. Express container services
are growing in importance. The freightliner services, introduced in 1965 by
Freightliners Ltd., now serve a network of 28 main terminals throughout
Great Britain, with connections to the continent of Europe.
National Freight The National Freight Corporation was set up under the 1968 Transport Act.
Corporation It operates the depots, vehicles, warehouses, containers and other equipment,
though not the actual trains used, in the freightliners and sundries services, and
has a large road haulage fleet of 23,800 vehicles. It has a capital of about ,£110
million, and employs 50,600 people; annual turnover amounts to some £223
million.
Freightliners Ltd., a company jointly owned by the National Freight
Corporation and the British Railways Board (with 51 per cent and 49 per cent
of the shares respectively), is responsible for the marketing and management
of freightliner services. The British Railways Board makes a charge for
providing and hauling the trains, and profits are divided between the board and
the corporation in proportion to their holdings.
Freight
Integration
Council
A Freight Integration Council, set up under the 1968 Act, advises the Depart¬
ment of the Environment and the Secretary of State for Scotland on the pro¬
vision of integrated freight services by publicly owned bodies. It consists of
several independent members with an independent chairman, the chairmen
of the National Freight Corporation and the British Railways Board, and
members representing union interests.
Railways in The Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the Northern
Northern Ireland Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway service on 200
miles (322 kilometres) of track. Improvements to the rail system under a
modernisation scheme involve the re-opening of several stretches of line I
closed in earlier years and the introduction of new rolling stock. The Belfast
Central Railway is being rebuilt for passenger traffic and should be open by
mid-1975.
Channel Tunnel Following completion of final studies into the financial and technical feasibility
of a bored rail tunnel under the Channel, the British Government announced
in 1973 that it intended, subject to Parliamentary approval, to proceed with
the project in association with the French Government and an international
group of banking and other interests. Initial works are in progress. The present
Government has decided that there should be a full re-assessment of the
project before any decision is taken to embark on the main construction works.
The Channel Tunnel would run from Cheriton, near Folkestone, on the
British side, to Frethun in France. There would be three tunnels—two single

track railway tunnels linked by crossovers and a separate service tunnel con¬
nected to the other tunnels by cross passages. An electrified rail link, suitable
for very high-speed running, would be built from Cheriton to London.
Services through the tunnel would include through rail passenger and freight
services—freightliner-type and bulk trainload traffic—motorail services and
ferry train services for road vehicles. The total cost, excluding the rail link,
has been estimated at £468 million at 1973 prices. This would be shared
equally between Britain and France.
Public road passenger transport in Britain is provided mainly by publicly
owned operators but partly by private firms. In the public sector in Great
Britain 25,000 vehicles are operated by the National Bus Company and the
Scottish Transport Group, 11,000 by the Passenger Transport Authorities,
6,500 by London Transport and over 6,000 by local authority undertakings.
There are about 5,000 privately owned fleets (of which the majority have five
vehicles or less) comprising some 25,000 vehicles.
The Road Traffic Act 1930 (consolidated in the Road Traffic Act i960) ended
the licensing of public service vehicles (that is, buses and coaches) by local
authorities and set up instead traffic areas each under the control of three
traffic commissioners. The commissioners are responsible for ensuring the
fitness of vehicles used in public road passenger transport, and for licensing
services in order to secure proper co-ordination and to eliminate unnecessary
competition; to this end they may fix routes, timetables and fares.
Capital grants may be made by the Government towards the cost of invest¬
ment in public transport, at rates of up to 75 per cent of approved cost. Eligible
schemes include improvements or extensions of railway lines, new fixed track
rail and bus systems, interchanges, stations, car parks, urban and suburban
railway rolling stock, resignalling, train control systems and automatic fare
collection. Local authorities may assist unremunerative bus services in rural
areas and where they do so the Government reimburses half their expenditure.
From 1 st April 1975 in England and Wales both types of grant will be replaced
by a new unified system of central government support for local transport
expenditure, under which grants will be paid to county councils to enable
them to carry out comprehensive transport policies and programmes.
Grants at the rate of 50 per cent are available towards the cost of new buses
complying with specifications approved by the Department of the Environ¬
ment. The Government also makes grants to offset the duty charged on fuel
used on local bus services.
The National Bus Company operates in England and Wales through locally
based subsidiaries such as the Western National Omnibus Company, Ribble
Motor Services Ltd. and Crosville Motor Services Ltd. At the end of 1973 it
owned some 20,000 vehicles and employed 68,000 people. In 1973 passenger
journeys on the company’s buses amounted to 2,314 million.
The Scottish Transport Group operates bus services in Scotland and
shipping services on the Clyde and to the Western Isles. It has 4,500 vehicles.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd. operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd. operates most
of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland.

BRITAIN 1975: an OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Transport Act 1968 enables Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs) to
be set up to control and co-ordinate the different forms of transport in any
particular area. PTAs have been set up in England and Wales in the conurba¬
tions of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands, Tyne and Wear,
South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. In each case the PTA is the metro¬
politan county council, which is also responsible for land use policy and
transport matters in general. The PTAs are responsible for policy as a whole,
and appoint professional Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) to be
responsible for day-to-day management and operations. The PTEs operate
their own bus services and enter into agreements with other bodies, such as
the British Railways Board and the National Bus Company. In 1972 four of
the English PTAs became responsible for local rail services in their areas and
subsequently reached agreement with the British Railways Board on their
future operation.
The Greater London Council (GLC) is the transport planning authority for
London as a whole and is responsible for the central bus and Underground
rail services, managed and operated by the London Transport Executive
which is appointed by the GLC. The buses serving areas around London and
the long-distance Green Line coach services are run by London Country Bus
Services Ltd., a subsidiary of the National Bus Company. Some 10,500 taxi¬
cabs that ply for hire in the streets are privately operated by companies or
owner-drivers and are licensed annually by the Metropolitan Police. There
are about 15,000 licensed cab drivers. In addition, numerous car-hire firms
are in operation.
London Transport’s railway network stretches over 20 miles (32 kilometres)
from north to south and 35 miles (56 kilometres) from east to west. In January
1974 the total length of the railway over which London Transport trains
operated was 252 miles (406 kilometres), of which 99 miles (159 kilometres)
were underground. London Transport trains serve 278 stations and its buses
travel over 1,731 miles (2,786 kilometres) of roads. To carry traffic over all this
area London Transport owns 4,379 railway cars and 6,534 buses. The total
staff employed is over 54,000.
Improvements being carried out by London Transport have included
extension and modernisation of parts of the Underground system, and the
introduction of automatic fare collection and automatic trains. Work is in
progress on the construction of the first stage of the new Fleet Line, which is
projected to link the north-west and south-east suburbs of London, and on a
scheme to link Heathrow airport with the Underground railway system which
should be completed in 1976.
One-man operation of buses is being steadily extended over a period of
years although certain heavily used routes in central London will continue to
be operated by two-man crews. The first one-man-operated double decker
buses were introduced in 1969; some 1,000 of these buses had been delivered
by mid-1974. Experimental ‘minibus’ services are in operation in some
suburban areas.
London Transport operates an international advisory service for city trans¬
port.
Development
Improvements to public transport services and passenger facilities are being
undertaken in many areas of Britain. Plans in Greater Glasgow are centred on
a complete modernisation of Glasgow’s underground system and, in associa-

tion with British Rail, integration of rail services on the north and south banks
of the Clyde in the ‘Clyderail’ scheme; in addition, the city’s bus network is
being improved. A light rapid transit system under construction on Tyneside
involves the electrification of two suburban railway lines, linked by new
tunnels under Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, and a new bridge over
the Tyne. The system, which should be operating in 1980, will be 34 miles (55
kilometres) long with 46 stations. The project is the largest provincial urban
transport scheme to have been prepared in Britain in the twentieth century.
An extensive road-building programme has been in progress since 1955. Public
expenditure on the construction and improvement of roads in Great Britain is
estimated at over £600 million in 1974-75.
Roads are classified according to their traffic value. Trunk roads provide a
national network of routes for through traffic; other roads are divided into
principal and non-principal roads. Motorways are roads specially designed for
high-speed traffic only.
In mid-1974, Great Britain had about 212,000 miles (341,500 kilometres)
of public highway. There were 9,500 miles (15,300 kilometres) of trunk roads,
of which 1,120 miles (1,802 kilometres) were motorways; 20,400 miles (32,800
kilometres) of principal roads, of which some 46 miles (74 kilometres) were
motorways; and 182,300 miles (293,000 kilometres) of other roads, including
unsurfaced roads.
In Northern Ireland in mid-1973 there were 14,189 miles (22,835 kilo¬
metres) of public roads comprising 317 miles (510 kilometres) of trunk roads,
1,026 miles (1,651 kilometres) of Class I roads, 1,737 miles (2,795 kilometres)
of Class II roads, 2,887 miles (4,646 kilometres) of Class III roads and 8,222
miles (13,232 kilometres) of unclassified roads.
At the end of March 1974 in England 988 miles (1,590 kilometres) of motor¬
ways had been opened for traffic and construction had started on a further 197
miles (317 kilometres). Schemes for an additional 574 miles (924 kilometres)
were being prepared. In Wales 27 miles (43 kilometres) were in use. In
Scotland about 95 miles (153 kilometres) of motorway had been opened and
construction had started on a further 15 miles (24 kilometres), while schemes
for an additional 55 miles (89 kilometres) were being prepared. About 60 miles
(97 kilometres) of motorway were in use in Northern Ireland. (See map on
p. 368.)
A government trunk road programme aims to provide a comprehensive net¬
work of strategic routes of high quality to link the major centres of population
and to serve the most important ports and airports. By early 1974 some 1,700
miles (2,740 kilometres) of strategic routes were open to traffic.
A large programme of bridge and tunnel building has been undertaken in
recent years. The bridges include the suspension bridge across the Firth of
Forth, the Severn Bridge incorporating major advances in suspension bridge
design, and the 7,000-ft (2,134-metre) bridge across the Firth of Tay. The new
^5-5 million London Bridge over the river Thames was officially opened in
1973. A £26 million bridge across the river Humber, with a span of 4,626 feet
(1,410 metres)—longer than any existing bridge span in the world—is to be
completed in 1976-77. A £10 million bridge over the river Foyle in London¬
derry should be completed in 1977.
Among major recent tunnel schemes has been the second Mersey crossing
of which the first twin tunnel was opened in 1971 and the second in February

1974. A second crossing of the Thames at Hartford, Kent, is under con¬
struction.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is the highway authority for
trunk roads in England and on these roads he administers expenditure, which
is provided wholly from central government sources, although for many pur¬
poses he employs local authorities as his agents. The Secretary of State for
Scotland has corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland and the
Secretary of State for Wales for roads in Wales. Work on major trunk road
schemes in England, including motorways, is controlled by regional road con¬
struction units, manned jointly by Department of the Environment and county
council staff. The highway authority for non-trunk roads in England and Wales
is, in general, the county council in whose area the roads lie. The Secretary
of State makes specific grants towards approved expenditure on construction
and major improvement of principal roads. From 1st April 1975 expenditure
by local authorities on building and maintaining the non-trunk roads will be
eligible for grants under the new support system (see p. 315). In Scotland the
highway authority for principal roads is the county or large burgh council;
from May 1975 it will be the regional or islands council.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment is directly
responsible for the trunk road system and bears the entire cost of maintenance
and construction work on these roads; in October 1973 it became responsible
for the other roads, formerly the responsibility of the local road authorities.
Research on roads is carried out at the Department of the Environment’s
Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL). The laboratory provides
technical and scientific advice and information to help in formulating, develop¬
ing and implementing government policies relating to roads and transport,
including their interaction with urban and regional planning. Work is con¬
cerned with planning, design, construction and maintenance of roads and
structures such as bridges and tunnels; safe, efficient and convenient move¬
ment of people and goods, including road layout and transport networks,
control of traffic flow, study of road accidents and methods of reducing their
frequency and severity; assessment of existing and projected passenger or
freight transport systems and investigation of technical developments and their
environmental effects. The TRRL employs over 1,000 people of whom about
half are scientists and engineers.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933 established a system of licensing for
road haulage vehicles designed to restrict vehicle operations to proved needs.
A new goods vehicle licensing system, aimed solely at improving safety, has
been introduced as provided under the Transport Act 1968. Those operating
vehicles of over 3^ tons gross weight (with certain special exemptions) now
require an operator’s licence, obtained on showing ability to maintain vehicles
properly and control loading and hours worked by drivers. It may also be
necessary to demonstrate adequate financial resources for compliance with
these conditions. Licences are granted by independent, quasi-judicial licensing
authorities, and may be revoked, suspended or curtailed if necessary. Regula¬
tions concerning the fitness and loading of vehicles have become more stringent
under recent legislation. Holders of operators’ licences may carry their own or
other people’s goods and are free of statutory control over their charges. Over
900,000 goods vehicles not exceeding 3^ tons gross laden weight are exempt
from operators’ licensing. In Northern Ireland there is a separate licensing
320
Road Safety
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
system for road haulage operation. About 1,760 operators and 3,940 vehicles
are licensed, the biggest single operator being Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd.,
owned jointly by the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company and the
National Freight Corporation.
European Community rules setting new requirements for drivers’ hours,
rest periods, records and daily distances applied in Britain from April 1973 to
commercial vehicles on international journeys. Journeys entirely within Great
Britain, regulated under the Transport Act 1968, are due to become subject to
the Community rules from 1st January 1976 with the exception of most bus
services. The European Community rules limit drivers in general to eight
hours’ driving a day. The tachograph, an instrument automatically measuring
vehicle travelling activity, is due to become a compulsory fitting on all goods
vehicles of over 3% tonnes gross weight—for new vehicles from 1st January
1976 and for vehicles already in operation from 1st January 1978.
Britain has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the world but a rela¬
tively good accident record, the fatal accident rate per vehicle being lower
than that in most other European countries. In 1973, 7,400 people were killed
on the roads, about 89,400 seriously injured and 256,900 slightly injured. Road
accident statistics are compiled and published by the Government Statistical
Service from reports made by the police.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. There are speed limits of 30 mph
(48 kph) in most built-up areas, 40, 50 and 60 mph (64, 80 and 97 kph) on
selected roads where appropriate and 70 mph (113 kph) on other roads in¬
cluding motorways where no lower limit applies. In Northern Ireland there is
no speed limit on motorways. Other measures directed primarily towards road
safety include the provision of pedestrian crossings and the system of road
markings and traffic signs which are being replaced by improved signs in
accordance with general European practice. A centrally controlled, com¬
puterised signalling system is being installed on motorways to warn motorists
of advisory speed limits in certain conditions and of lane closures.
The design of vehicles, their use on the roads, and the maintenance of their
mechanical condition are controlled by regulations. The regulations are kept
under constant review, and amended whenever necessary in the interests of
safety or for control of pollution and noise. The fitting of seat belts to the front
seats is compulsory for cars first registered in or after 1965 and for light goods
vehicles first registered in or after 1967. In Great Britain private cars and light
vans which are three or more years old must be tested annually at private
garages authorised as test stations. In Northern Ireland a scheme to test
private cars, initially ten or more years old, at vehicle driving test centres will
be introduced in October 1974. Heavy goods vehicles are tested annually at
government test stations. Public service vehicles must be specially approved
before being licensed to carry passengers, and are tested at regular intervals.
Any vehicle may be stopped on the road at any time by the police and examined.
All drivers of motor vehicles, unless they have either held a full British
licence or passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the
test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test they
must obtain a ‘provisional’ licence and display ‘L’ (Learner) plates on their
vehicle. In Northern Ireland a driver having passed the test is required to
display an ‘R’ (Restricted) plate for a one-year period during which he must
not exceed 45 mph (72 kph). With the exception of solo motor-cycles and
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
321
motor-cycle combinations, where vehicles are constructed to carry passengers,
learner drivers must be accompanied by a qualified driver. (Newly arrived
residents of Britain may drive under their overseas driving licences for three
months before becoming subject to these rules.) Professional driving instruc¬
tors must be approved by the Department of the Environment. There is a
scheme for special licensing and testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles. A
new Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre at Swansea began operating in
1973; it will eventually deal with all licensing and registration of vehicles and
drivers in Great Britain.
The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 26
most serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users and a summary of the requirements of
the law are set out in easily understandable form in the Highway Code. A failure
to observe the code does not of itself render a person liable to criminal pro¬
ceedings but may be taken into account in any such proceedings. The Road
Safety Act 1967 made it an offence to drive with more than a prescribed level
of alcohol in the blood, at present 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 milli¬
litres of blood. The wearing of safety helmets by all riders of motor-cycles,
scooters and mopeds was made compulsory in 1973.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads are
conducted by the Department of the Environment and the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Accidents with assistance from the local authorities, which
also help by arranging courses of instruction, especially courses for children.
In recent years major publicity campaigns have been undertaken to increase
the wearing of seat belts and reduce pedestrian casualties.
Control of Traffic The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967 empowers traffic authorities to make
orders regulating traffic and imposing parking control. With the exception of
trunk roads, which are the concern of the central Government, traffic is the
responsibility of local authorities. Extensive schemes are being undertaken
for the improvement of road safety and the relief of traffic congestion particu¬
larly in the centres of cities. These include: ‘fly-overs’ at road junctions; new
outlet roads from cities; provision of parking spaces at railway stations to
encourage motorists to travel to work by train; and traffic management mea¬
sures, including comprehensive control of street parking, ‘one-way’ systems,
peak hour ‘clearways’ prohibiting waiting on busy roads, the restriction of
traffic in some streets to buses, taxis and delivery vehicles, and ‘tidal flow’
arrangements. Lanes reserved for buses are being introduced in many large
towns—in Greater London there were 62 bus lanes in use in July 1974. A
Traffic Advisory Unit within the Department of the Environment advises
local authorities. In most town centres street parking is permitted for limited
periods only; in London and many other towns schemes for payment at park¬
ing meters or residents’ parking spaces are under the supervision of traffic
wardens. Disc schemes providing free but limited parking facilities are in
operation in some towns, including Cheltenham, Devizes, Harrogate and
Ripon. The Government is identifying and acquiring a national network of
long-distance lorry parks. A computer-controlled system to regulate traffic
was installed in west London in 1968. Similar systems are operating in
Glasgow and Liverpool. The Government is devising, in co-operation with
local authorities, a system of advisory lorry routes. Local authorities are
required to complete comprehensive plans for dealing with heavy lorries by
the beginning of 1977. In the interest of environmental improvement, long-

distance and in particular heavy goods traffic, is being diverted from many
towns and villages; lorries of 40 feet (12 metres) and longer are banned from
travelling into central London except for delivery purposes.
Since 1963 control of the majority of inland waterways has been vested in the
British Waterways Board. Under the Transport Act 1968 a grant-in-aid is
being paid primarily to enable the board to maintain an extensive network of
amenity waterways; in 1973 £3-7 million was paid and a further ^1-3 million
for improving bridges.
There are about 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometres) of navigable inland waterways
in Great Britain, some 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometres) of which belong to the
British Waterways Board; the remainder are mainly in the hands of water
authorities or private companies. Many of the board’s canals are narrow water¬
ways which can generally be used only by boats not exceeding 7 ft (2*13 metres)
in width; others are broad waterways, ship canals and canalised rivers, some of
which can be used by craft of up to about 1,000 tons capacity. Of the inland
waterways under the control of the British Waterways Board some 340 miles
(547 kilometres) are commercial waterways, which are mainly canalised river
navigations. A substantial additional mileage (1,100 miles—1,770 kilo¬
metres—known as cruising waterways) is being maintained for recreational
purposes; a statutory Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council advises
the Secretary of State for the Environment and the British Waterways Board.
Engineering, commercial and estate work is directed from the board’s head¬
quarters in London. There are also principal offices at Leeds and Gloucester.
In Scotland the Caledonian Canal and the other Scottish canals are, for en¬
gineering and estate purposes, under the control of the board’s office in
Glasgow, with direction as a whole from London.
In 1973 traffic on the board’s waterways amounted to just under 5 million
tonnes, of which 2-1 million tonnes were coal, 1-3 million tonnes liquids in
bulk and 1 -6 million tonnes general cargo. Some 97 per cent of the traffic is
carried on the commercial waterways.
Although the British Waterways Board is the largest single carrying operator,
most of the traffic is handled by independent carriers or by traders in their
own craft. The board at the end of 1973 owned 427 freight-carrying craft
(including tugs) with a carrying capacity of 17,500 tonnes. It operates 2 docks
and 19 warehousing depots.
In Northern Ireland, the only inland waterway which is still used for com¬
mercial transport purposes is the Lower Bann Navigation.
The British Waterways Board is developing its cruising waterways for purposes
of recreation and amenity. Among the most popular are the Llangollen branch
of the Shropshire Union Canal, the Oxford Canal, and the Leeds and Liver¬
pool Canal. Many disused waterways are being restored in co-operation with
local authorities and voluntary societies. The principal commercial waterways
are the river navigations and broad canals in the Yorkshire-Humberside area,
the Trent Navigation, and the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. New facilities
and waterway improvements are being undertaken to increase freight traffic.
The board has devised and is already operating on some of its commercial
waterways a specially designed interlocking modular barge system. A ship
capable of carrying small, 140-ton capacity barges entered service in 1974,
initially running between Rotterdam and the Humber and Tees estuaries.
The board’s turnover in 1973 amounted to ^6-7 million, of which ^0-3
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

million arose from its own freight-carrying activities, ^i-6 million from ware¬
housing and terminal services, and ^1-4 million from the docks. The sale of
water for industrial and agricultural purposes brought in over ^1 million.
Receipts from pleasure boating were £298,700. The number of pleasure craft
licensed or registered in 1973 was 23,700.

CIVIL AVIATION
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited and this company pioneered the commercial development of inter¬
continental air routes. By 1929 there was a through service from England to
India. The first passenger service to Australia started in 1935.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), a public corporation,
took over the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways
Limited in 1940. British European Airways (BEA) was established under the
Civil Aviation Act 1946 as a separate public corporation to cover the United
Kingdom and Europe.
BOAC and BEA have become divisions of British Airways (see p. 325)
following a major reorganisation of the control of British civil aviation through
the Civil Aviation Act 1971. Under this Act were created the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) and the British Airways Board (BAB). The new bodies
became fully operative on 1st April 1972.
The Secretary of State for Trade is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with other countries, the
licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain by overseas
operators and British participation in the activities of the International Civil
Aviation Organisation and other international aviation bodies), airport policy,
amenity matters such as aircraft noise, aviation security policy and investiga¬
tion of accidents. The Secretary of State appoints the chairman and other
members of the CAA, and is empowered to give written guidance on the general
policies to be followed. The guidance must be approved by both Houses of
Parliament, and the CAA is then bound by it.
The Secretary of State may also give directions, after consultation, to the
CAA, concerning Britain’s relations with other countries, membership of
international organisations or adherence to international agreements, or to
deal with problems of noise, vibration, pollution or other disturbances arising
from the activities of civil aviation. He may also give directions, after consulta¬
tion, to the BAB concerning matters affecting the public interest. He has
powers to make funds available to the CAA and the BAB, with the approval
of the Treasury and within limits laid down by Parliament.
The Civil Aviation Authority is an independent statutory body, responsible
for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry, the
operation of Aberdeen Airport and the Scottish Highlands and Islands aero¬
dromes and the provision by the National Air Traffic Services of air navigation
services and the aerodrome navigation services at certain British airports. It
issues licences and certificates to airlines, aircraft, aerodromes and personnel,
including pilots, air traffic controllers and maintenance engineers.
The CAA has been given the objective of recovering, by 1977-78, the whole
of its costs and a reasonable return on capital from the users of its services.
Meanwhile the Government is paying the CAA a grant to meet its deficit on
revenue account, assessed annually in advance; it amounted to £33 million
in I973-74-

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Civil Aviation Authority operates an air services licensing system, within
which British operators, both state-owned and independent, apply on an equal
footing for licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or
variation of existing licences. It determines categories of licence, content of
applications, and conditions and tariff provisions of licences. It also has power
to exempt particular flights or categories of flights from licence requirements.
In issuing licences the CAA must consider the applicant’s financial resources,
staffing and organisation, the need for the proposed services, their adequacy
and possible effect on existing services, and any representations made by
interested parties. Appeals may be made to the Secretary of State for Trade.
A new CAA scheme for licensing air travel organisers came into operation in
1973. The Airline Users Committee was established by the CAA in 1973 to
assist in protecting the interests of passengers and other airline users, and to
investigate individual complaints against airlines.
The CAA is responsible for the regulation of the safety of British civil aircraft.
Its Airworthiness Division is responsible for British Civil Airworthiness
Requirements, a code with which all aircraft built in Britain are expected
to comply. Continued airworthiness is ensured by regular inspection and by
requiring aircraft to be maintained in accordance with a schedule approved by
the CAA. The authority is advised by an Airworthiness Requirements Board
representing various interests including manufacturers, operators, pilots and
insurers.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when
it is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of his
aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline
pilots) check that satisfactory operating standards are maintained by these
operators. In addition to British Airways 62 independent air transport opera¬
tors hold an Air Operator’s Certificate.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Applicants for professional
pilots’ licences are required to attend approved courses of training before
attempting qualifying examinations and flight tests. The CAA has approved
such courses at training schools at Carlisle, Oxford and Perth, as well as the
College of Air Training at Hamble. The latter was set up in i960 to increase
the supply of well-trained pilots for civil airlines. It is sponsored by British
Airways. An engineering apprentice school was set up at Cranebank, near
Heathrow, in 1970.
An Air Transport and Travel Industry Training Board has been established
under the Industrial Training Act 1964.
Responsibility for policy planning and execution of both civil and military
air traffic control over Britain and the surrounding seas rests with the National
Air Traffic Services, under the joint control of the Civil Aviation Authority
and the Secretary of State for Defence.
In 1950 a system of airways covering the main traffic routes with control zones
around the major airports was introduced. Subsequently, the airway system
has been revised and extended to meet traffic requirements, employing
principally very high frequency omnirange beacons as the primary navigation
aid. There are three main air traffic control centres: at London for southern

England, at Preston for the north of England and Wales, and at Prestwick for
Scotland and the Atlantic Ocean to 30°W.
A variety of radar installations and other equipment provides the means by
which the system can accept the increasingly heavy load of air traffic. Britain
was the first country to use radar for the control of through civil air traffic.
During the next few years virtually the whole of the airspace over Britain above
5,000 feet (1,500 metres) will be brought under surveillance by the latest types
of primary and secondary radar equipment, which will provide data to be used
in two air traffic control centres, located at West Drayton (near London) and
Prestwick. The first stage was introduced in 1971. Early in 1975 a subsidiary
centre will be opened at Manchester to deal with traffic in the Manchester
terminal control area. Extensive use will be made in these centres of auto¬
matic data processing and other advanced electronic techniques.
Britain has pioneered the development of all-weather landing systems, based
on an improved version of the standard instrument landing system used at all
major airports. The Blind Landing Experimental Unit of the Royal Aircraft
Establishment at Bedford and private industry have worked towards fully
automatic landing which is widely used on scheduled flights.
Britain is a member of Eurocontrol, a European international agency concerned
with the traffic control problems arising from the increasing use of high-flying,
high-speed jet aircraft. Set up in 1963 it provides control at the higher flight
levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft operating according to civil
procedures.
Since 1971 all new types of subsonic aircraft using British airports have been
required to hold a ‘certificate of quietness’. The noise standards for this pur¬
pose follow the recommendations of the special meeting held by the In¬
ternational Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal in 1969, subsequently
embodied in an annex to the Chicago Convention on International Civil
Aviation.
Noise abatement measures in force at various airports include limitations
on noise levels at take-off, route restrictions, limits on the number of jet move¬
ments during summer nights and other procedures designed to lessen noise on
the ground.
The board of British Airways controls the activities of the seven divisions of
British Airways—British Airways European Division, British Airways Over¬
seas Division, British Airways Regional Division, British Airways Associated
Companies Ltd., British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd., British Airways
Helicopters Ltd. and International Aeradio Ltd. The chairman and members
of the board are appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade. British
Airways’ total borrowing and investment limit is fixed at ^560 million; it may
be increased up to £700 million by statutory order. During the year 1973-74
the board’s turnover was £647 million and it made a net profit of £16-6
million. Revenue earned by the airline divisions amounted to £578 million, of
which 56 per cent was earned overseas. Some i6'i million passengers were
carried, 20 per cent more than in 1972-73. At March 1974 British Airways
employed about 58,800 staff. Its assets of £528 million included £370 million
of aircraft and spares and ^85 million of land and buildings.
British Airways has the largest route network in the world, almost 500,000
miles (800,000 kilometres), covering 200 destinations in 88 countries.
The Overseas Division is engaged on long-haul operations. Its scheduled ser¬
vices link Britain with continental Europe, the Middle East, the Far East,

Australasia, Africa and North and South America, and also provide complete
round-the-world services.
The European Division operates on short-haul and medium-haul services in
Britain and the rest of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
The Regional Division is responsible for secondary domestic services and for a
network of services to Europe operated by British Airways-Cambrian, British
Airways-Channel, British Airways-Northeast and British Airways-Scottish.
Its services in Britain include a number which meet a vital social need, mainly
the services to and from the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
British Airways Associated Companies Ltd. is responsible for the group’s
investments connected with some 40 hotel companies and nine air companies
in different parts of the world. The helicopter division—British Airways
Helicopters Ltd.—operates a scheduled service between Penzance, Cornwall,
and the Isles of Scilly, undertakes charter work, provides links between oil rigs
in the North Sea and the mainland and operates the air-sea rescue service
from Aberdeen. Engine overhaul work for British Airways and other airlines is
carried out by British Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd. International Aeradio
Ltd. plans, installs, operates and maintains airport technical services and
general communications and manufactures specialised equipment for use in
these services. British Airways also controls British Airtours which operates
charter flights. British Airways Cargo-UK was established in 1974 to control
British Airways’ cargo-handling facilities at 18 airports in Britain.
The British Airways fleet of some 220 aircraft in May 1974 is the world’s
largest passenger fleet operating international services. Aircraft in the Overseas
Division consist of Super VCios (16), VCios (9), Boeing joy-436s (9), Boeing
707-3365 (11), and 15 Boeing 747s. The European Division contains BAG
One-Elevens (18), Trident Threes (26), Trident Twos (15) and 20 Trident Ones.
British Airways has converted the Vanguard aircraft into the Merchantman
used solely for freight and nine are now in service. The Regional Division’s
fleet consists of BAG One-Elevens (7), Viscounts (35), Trident Ones (4), and
Skyliners (2). British Airtours has 9 Boeing 707-4365. Helicopters in the
helicopter division include Sikorsky 6iNs (10), Bell Jet Ranger (1) and Bell 212
(1). Major orders include five Concorde supersonic aircraft and two Boeing 747s
for the Overseas Division and nine Lockheed TriStars for the European
Division.
Although the public sector had a formal monopoly up to 1961 there has been
a significant expansion in the last 20 years not only of the number of passengers
and volume of freight carried but also in the diversity of services operated by
the independent operators. The independent companies compete with British
Airways over several domestic routes, including the busiest internal route in
Europe, from London to Glasgow. In 1973 they carried some 5-9 million
passengers on scheduled services. British Caledonian Airways, the ‘second
force’ airline, has a fleet of some 31 aircraft, used on chartered and scheduled
passenger and freight services, and carries about 1 -3 million scheduled service
passengers a year. A new type of airline scheduled service—the Skytrain in¬
volving a one-way non-reservation service—has been proposed by Laker
Airways and the CAA has granted a licence for a London to New York
service, although it has not yet been approved by the United States authorities.
In addition to the public transport operators there are a large number of
companies engaged in miscellaneous aviation activities such as crop-spraying,

aerial survey and photography, and flying instruction. About 30 companies
carry out air-taxi operations.
Total capacity offered on all services by British airlines rose by 9 per cent in
1973 to 9,003 million capacity-tonne-kilometres. In 1955, 2-5 million pas¬
sengers entered or left Britain by air, compared with 57 million who arrived
or departed by sea; in 1962 there were for the first time more air than sea
passengers, and by 1973 the figures were 31 million by air (international
terminal passengers) and 12-5 million by sea. British Airways accounts for
some 92 per cent of scheduled services flown by British airlines. The charter
market is dominated by independent companies; British Caledonian has 26
per cent of the market, other independent airlines 53 per cent and British
Airways’ charter subsidiaries 21 per cent.
Freight traffic in 1973 amounted to some 699,500 tonnes, 8 per cent higher
than in 1972. This growth is reflected in the figures showing the proportion
of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air. In 1956, 17 per cent of imports and
2-9 per cent of exports (by value) were carried by air. In 1973 the correspond¬
ing percentages were 15 for imports and 17 for exports, and the total value of
exports, imports and re-exports by air was .£4,480 million. The chief export
items are expensive machinery and parts, aircraft and vehicle parts, and
electrical and electronic products; furs and skins account for a large propor¬
tion of the total value of re-exports.
The estimated number of aircraft on the British register used for business and
private purposes is 2,218 while approximately 939 are owned by clubs, groups
and training schools. About 19,300 private pilots hold licences. About 100
companies use corporate aircraft and 65 companies are members of the
Business Aircraft Users’ Association. There are some 9,000 glider pilots.
Passenger movements at the principal airports have risen very markedly in
recent years and in 1973 Britain’s civil airports handled 44-4 million passengers.
The leading airports were Heathrow—14 miles (22 kilometres) west of central
London—207 million passengers, Gatwick 5-8 million, Luton 3-2 million,
Manchester 27 million, Glasgow 2*2 million, Belfast 1-3 million, Birmingham
i*2 million, Edinburgh 893,000 and Prestwick 657,000. Air transport move¬
ments have grown at a slower rate than passenger movements; in 1973 there
were 719,000 movements of aircraft engaged on commercial transport
operations.
There are approximately 150 civil airports in Britain; in addition, 50 Service
aerodromes are available for civil use.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body
operating on a commercial basis, was created in 1966 to own and manage
London’s two major airports (Heathrow and Gatwick), Prestwick in Scotland
and Stansted; it acquired responsibility for Edinburgh airport in 1971. Aber¬
deen and eight small airfields in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland are
controlled by the Civil Aviation Authority. Aberdeen is to be transferred to
the BAA which will establish a new organisation to administer its Scottish
airports. Most of the other public airports are controlled by local authorities.
Municipally or privately owned airports or airfields which are used for the
public transport of passengers and/or flying instruction are subject to licensing,

inspection and regulation by the CAA, which is also responsible for navigation
facilities at the BAA’s airports and a number of the main municipal airports.
For international scheduled services Heathrow and Gatwick are the main
airports and Heathrow is the busiest centre of international travel in the world.
An £8 million programme is under way for the improvement of two passenger
terminals. The London Airport Cargo Electronic-data-processing Scheme
(LACES) came into full operation at Heathrow in 1971, making Britain the
first country to control incoming cargo by computer. The airport at Gatwick,
28 miles (45 kilometres) south of London, was opened in 1958 as the second
airport for the London area. Built alongside the main London to Brighton
railway and the A23 road, Gatwick airport was the first in the world to contain
road, rail and air transport in one unit. The first stage of a £37 million expan¬
sion scheme was completed in mid-1974; the project involves the construction
of a new arrivals terminal and improvements to passenger facilities.
Work is in progress to develop facilities at many of Britain’s other airports.
A £7 million extension to Manchester airport, controlled by the Manchester
District Council and the Greater Manchester County Council, was opened in
March 1974. The extension doubled the airport’s passenger handling capacity
and enabled it to accommodate Boeing 747 (jumbo jet) aircraft. Prestwick
airport in Scotland has been developed to accommodate large jet aircraft and a
new cargo terminal has been built. It is already one of the best-equipped freight
airports in the world. An .£11 million redevelopment scheme for Edinburgh
airport involves the construction of a new terminal, which is expected to be in
operation by 1976; in addition, a new 8,400-foot (2,560-metre) runway is
under construction. A ^1-5 million scheme is being undertaken by the CAA
to strengthen and lengthen the main runway at Inverness airport. At Sumburgh
in the Shetland Islands, an important staging post for communications between
the Scottish mainland and many North Sea oil rigs, a ^1-5 million scheme is
being undertaken to improve the runway.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, public telecommunications,
data processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the
Post Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department.
The Post Office is headed by a chairman, appointed by the Secretary of State
for Industry. It has some 420,000 employees and nearly 24,000 post offices.
The Post Office has authority to borrow up to £3,800 million with provision
for an increase to £4,800 million, if necessary. At 31st March 1974 it had
borrowed £3,300 million. Over 90 per cent of total expenditure on fixed assets
is accounted for by telecommunications. The Post Office is investing some
£4,000 million in the period 1973-77.
Some 10,392 million items of correspondence and about 184 million parcels
are carried annually by the inland postal services. An increasing amount of
correspondence is sent by air, reaching 467 million items in 1973-74; 2-6
million parcels were sent by air in that year.
New highly mechanised sorting office buildings are being opened in Britain.
Letter segregating and facing machines have been installed at some 39 centres.
Postal address coding (postcode) is in operation over the whole country. Some
£50 million is being invested in an improved parcels service.

the United States.
The British Postal Consultancy Service offers professional advice on all
aspects of postal business to overseas administrators and to business organisa¬
tions. Subjects covered include management methods and systems, postal
circulation systems, containerisation, planning of buildings and mechanisa¬
tion. Work was done in 1973-74 for seven overseas postal administrations.
At the post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph
facilities, a person can draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a licence for
his dog, a licence for his television receiving set, renew his motor vehicle
licence, obtain a British visitor’s passport, buy national insurance stamps, and
use the savings and investments facilities of the National Savings Bank (see
p. 367) and the money transmission services of the National Giro (see p. 366).
In much of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government
departments and local authorities.
Britain has one of the most up-to-date telegraph systems in the world and is
directly connected to most of the principal overseas telegraph offices. With the
exception of those offered by the small number of foreign telegraph companies
licensed to operate in Britain, all international public telegram services from
Britain are operated through the provincial and London offices of the Post
Office International Telegraph Service. Direct connection is available to the
main towns in the rest of Europe and to 49 other countries throughout the
world. Although connection is mainly semi-automatic between the inter¬
national telegraph centres, a computer-based telegram retransmission centre
will be fully operational in 1974-75.
The telex service combines the speed of the telephone with the accuracy of
the printed word. Calls may be made direct between the rapidly increasing
number of telex users in Britain (estimated at 50,000 by mid-1974) and also
to well over 550,000 subscribers throughout the world. Britain is linked to
over 170 countries by telex. The British telex service is fully automatic.
Connection is made by direct dialling to any subscriber within the country,
and about 98 per cent of international calls are also directly dialled. These
include calls to virtually the whole of Europe. Calls to countries not available
through the automatic service are connected through the International Telex
Exchange in London. The Post Office is planning for a system of about 100,000
British subscribers by 1980. A radioteleprinter service extends the use of telex
to ships at sea (see p. 331).
The demand for facilities enabling digital data to be transmitted over tele¬
phone and telegraph lines has greatly increased; to meet it the Post Office has
developed a range of datel services providing for transmission at rates of up to
no bits per second over telegraph-type circuits and up to 2,400 bits per
second (to be increased to 4,800 bits per second) over speech-type circuits.
Speeds of 48,000 bits per second can be accommodated over wider bandwidth
circuits by special arrangement. Most of the services are available inter¬
nationally over telegraph or speech-type circuits. In March 1974 the number
of British Post Office datel terminals amounted to some 29,600, more than the
rest of Europe combined.

At the end of March 1974 there were over 6,200 local telephone exchanges and
19-1 million telephones. During 1973-74, 1 -5 million new lines were installed.
All London’s exchanges are now automatic. Trunk dialling by subscribers
(STD) began in Bristol in 1958; by March 1974 the facility had been extended
to 4,857 exchanges, serving nearly all subscribers. In 1973-74 some 14,906
million telephone calls were made comprising 12,707 million local calls, 2,138
million trunk calls and 61 million international calls.
Hull District Council is the only municipality to exercise its option of
operating its own service under licence from the Post Office; this service is
connected to the Post Office trunk network.
The first operational electronic exchange in Europe was opened at Amber-
gate, Derbyshire, in 1966. There are now over 400 such exchanges in Britain.
Large electronic exchanges with capacities of up to 40,000 lines are due to come
into service in major cities by the mid-1970s. Mobile electronic exchanges
were introduced in 1973.
Pulse code modulation (PCM) systems developed in Britain are being used
to increase the circuit capacity of lines on short-distance routes between
exchanges. Over 2,300 were in service by the end of 1973.
International subscriber dialling operates from London and other major
cities to most of western Europe, the United States and Canada. Britain has
two automatic international telephone exchanges in use and two more under
construction. It is expected that by 1978 85 per cent of international calls will
be dialled direct, compared with about 65 per cent in 1973.
Operator-connected calls are handled at London international exchanges,
which are connected to over 4,000 direct telephone circuits to European
countries. Direct links via transatlantic and Commonwealth cable networks,
communications satellites and high frequency radio provide service to coun¬
tries outside Europe. Almost every country can be reached from the inter¬
national exchanges, via intermediate points where necessary.
A radio tower, 620 feet (189 metres) high, in London provides microwave
radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television circuits. There
are over 100 Post Office communications masts and towers in use.
Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the ‘999’
emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as quickly
as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade services.
A public radiotelephone service operating in London and south Lancashire
enables users of vehicles fitted with suitable equipment to make or receive calls
to or from any telephone in the British netwrork; the service is being extended
during 1974 to the Birmingham area and later to four other areas in Britain.
Recorded information services include: the speaking clock, weather forecasts,
motoring information, recipes, ‘Test match’ cricket scores, Financial Times
Share Index and Business News Summary, and ‘Dial a Disc’. In London a
recorded service provides details in five languages of events taking place, and a
similar service, in English only, is provided in Edinburgh during the summer.
There are over 252,000 private circuits not connected with the public exchange
networks. These are associated with circuits rented for private use for tele¬
phone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo-telegraphy, television,
music, or for the transmission of signals which represent data for computers
or operate other devices.
There are some 23 submarine cable systems between Britain and Europe and
five between Britain and North America, covering a total of about 14,000

miles (22,530 kilometres). Cable systems using transistors in place of ther¬
mionic valves have been developed by British manufacturers in consultation
with the Post Office Research Station and are used in many new systems. A
comprehensive Commonwealth telephone cable plan was agreed upon in 1958
and carried out by Cable and Wireless Ltd. in co-operation with the Post
Office. The plan covered the construction of three long-distance telephone
cable systems: CANTAT i (2,100 nautical miles), from Scotland to Canada,
was opened in 1961; COMPAC (8,130 nautical miles), connecting Canada,
Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia, opened in 1963; and SEACOM
(7,070 nautical miles), connecting Australia, New Guinea, Guam, Hong Kong,
Malaysia and Singapore, was completed in stages from 1965 to 1967. The
submarine cables are linked overland across Canada and Australia by radio
microwave systems. CANTAT 1 was the first single-cable ocean telephone
system to use the new lightweight cable and rigid two-way repeaters, both
developed by the Post Office.
Since CANTAT 1 was laid between Britain and Canada telephone calls have
risen substantially. CANTAT 2, which entered service in March 1974, has
doubled telephone links across the Atlantic, with its 1,840 circuits. It covers
2,800 nautical miles between Cornwall and Nova Scotia.
The Goonhilly satellite communication earth station in Cornwall was brought
into operation in 1962, and took part in the first experimental satellite com¬
munications using the Telstar and Relay satellites. A second aerial was
introduced in 1968 and a third was brought into use in 1972. The three aerials
provide commercial telephone and television circuits via high-capacity, geo¬
stationary satellites positioned over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In March
1974 Britain operated some 760 satellite telephone circuits to 32 countries. The
satellites used in the global communications systems are provided by the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (see p. 408) of which
Britain is the second largest shareholder.
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in Britain which provide radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges of up to some 500
miles (805 kilometres) and 250 miles (402 kilometres) respectively. There is
also the long-distance radiotelegraph and radiotelephone station, Portishead
Radio, which communicates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with
safety of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or air¬
craft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in distress.
During 1973-74 the stations handled 669 urgency and distress calls.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radiotelegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between tele¬
phone subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships. Radio teleprinter
facilities are being introduced at selected coast stations to enable ships to be
connected to telex subscribers ashore. The stations also broadcast naviga¬
tional warnings and weather bulletins.
The stations operate a free medical advice service whereby the master of a
ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical authorities
on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard ship. During
1973-74, 554 medical cases were dealt with in this service.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Post Office is one of the largest users of automatic data processing equip¬
ment and techniques in Britain. Its computer organisation is divided into two
parts: the Post Office Data Processing Service for its own internal services,
and the National Data Processing Service for services to business firms and
other external users.
In addition to stock control and telephone billing, computer systems are
used for large-scale document and information retrieval systems, the Giro
system, scheduling of mail vans in London, the LACES import-handling
system at Heathrow airport (see p. 328), and control of revenue collection from
television licences. In its 13 regional computer centres the Post Office Data
Processing Service operates 40 computers. Techniques and equipment em¬
ployed by the staff of over 4,000, of whom some 700 are systems analysts and
programmers, include optical and magnetic ink character reader/sorters;
direct keying of data on to discs and magnetic tapes; and the direct recording of
data from magnetic tapes to micro-film.
The world’s first purpose-built system of conferences by television, ‘Confra¬
vision’, was introduced by the Post Office in 1971. Using Post Office video
circuits the service allows private communication between studios in London,
Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, and Manchester.
The Post Office is spending over £20 million a year on research and develop¬
ment, in collaboration with industry and the universities. A new £10 million
research centre is being built at Martlesham Heath, Suffolk, to replace even¬
tually the laboratories at Dollis Hill.
16 Employment
The Department of Employment, together with the Manpower Services
Commission, is principally responsible for industrial relations, pay policy,
employment, training and related manpower questions in Great Britain (see
pp. 48 and 336). In Northern Ireland employment matters are the responsibility
of the Department of Manpower Services.
MANPOWER
The total working population of Britain at the middle of June 1973 was
25-5 million, about 46 per cent of the total population. If the unemployed,
the self-employed, and the Armed Forces are omitted from the working
population, there remained 22-2 million employees (13-5 million men and 87
million women) in employment. The percentage of women (particularly those
working part time) in the labour force is rising. The great majority of the
working population work for a wage or salary, but about i‘8 million are
employers or self-employed.
Northern Ireland, which has 2-8 per cent of the total population of the
United Kingdom, has 2-3 per cent of its working population (see p. 335).
Farmers and smallholders working their own holdings account for about
6 per cent of the working population.
Growth in The working population increased slowly until 1966, and declined between
Working 1966 and 1971, since when it has been rising again (see Table 27). One reason
Population for the fall after 1966 was the increased number in full-time education. During
the late 1970s the number of males in the labour force is expected to remain
approximately constant, while the number of females is expected to continue to
increase.
Though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions may
raise the working population above the levels forecast, any increasing demand
for labour must in general be met by better deployment of manpower, im¬
proved productivity and more training. Non-employed married women form
the only substantial reserve.
Deployment of The industrial distribution of employees is shown in Table 28. Of all em-
Manpower ployees about 36 per cent are employed in the manufacturing and mining
industries and under 2 per cent in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Well over
half of those in manufacturing are in the metal, engineering, vehicles and
chemicals groups of industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men though not always for the
same types of work; for example, few women are managers and few personal
secretaries are men. It is illegal to employ women in certain jobs, such as
underground work in coal mines. Women are chiefly employed in the food,
drink and tobacco industries; the manufacture of electrical goods, textiles and
clothing; the distributive trades; the financial, professional, scientific and
miscellaneous services; and public administration.
The numbers given in Table 28 as working in an industry or service include
those engaged on administrative, technical and clerical work, so that the totals
334 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
given for the production industries are greater than the numbers on productive
processes. It is estimated that in April 1974 in manufacturing industries in
Great Britain (comparable figures for Northern Ireland are not available)
27 per cent were administrative, technical and clerical employees (the ratio
ranged according to industry from 13 per cent in clothing and footwear to
39 per cent in chemicals and allied industries).
Manpower As an aid to government manpower policies the Manpower Services Corn-
Research and mission (see p. 336) maintains a continuing study of manpower resources and
Planning requirements for both the whole economy and for some particular industries
and occupations.
The commission, through its Training Services Agency (see p. 336), also
co-operates with industrial training boards on technical problems connected
with industrial and manpower planning, recruitment, training and careers
advice.
Unemployment The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole was among the lowest in
the world during the 20 years prior to 1967—usually between 1 and 2 per cent
—but has risen since then. It has been relatively low in the south-east of
England, and consistently higher in those parts of the country which have the
greatest dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the
heavy engineering and metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scot¬
land and Wales, and north-east England and Merseyside. These areas have
been the subject of a series of measures of selective assistance to stimulate
industrial expansion; and counter-measures have been taken to limit ex¬
pansion in areas of manpower shortage (see p. 205). The general unemploy¬
ment rate in Great Britain in July 1974 was 2-6 per cent: the areas with the
highest rates were Wales and Scotland and the North and North-West regions.
Northern The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
Ireland self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 578,700 in
June 1973 (380,800 males and 197,900 females). The number of insured

EMPLOYMENT

employees was 477,300. The largest productive industries are agriculture,
engineering, textiles and clothing. Most of the agricultural work in Northern
Ireland is done without hired help.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1974 it was 57 per cent of in¬
sured employees. The Northern Ireland Department of Commerce has wide
powers (similar to those in Great Britain) to assist the development and diver¬
sification of industry. It is using these powers vigorously in an attempt to
improve the situation (see p. 208).
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
The main government employment services are provided in Great Britain
through a country-wide network of ‘jobcentres’ (see p. 337) and employment
offices. The running of them is to be transferred to the Manpower Services
Commission from the Department of Employment. The services in Northern
Ireland are run on similar lines by the Department of Manpower Services but
there are some variations related to the much smaller area of administration.
Wide ranging changes are being made in the organisation of these services in
Great Britain.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Manpower Services Commission (MSC), set up under the Employment
and Training Act 1973 to manage the Government’s employment and training
services, came into operation on 1st January 1974. Its responsibilities are
exercised through two agencies, the Employment Service Agency (ESA)
which is to be transferred to the MSC from the Department of Employment
in October 1974, and the Training Services Agency (TSA) which became
fully operational under the MSC on 1st April 1974. The agencies are statu¬
tory organisations each headed by a chief executive appointed by the MSC
with the approval of the Secretary of State. The main object of the change is to
transfer direct control from the Government to representatives of employers
and employees and of local government and educational interests, who, to¬
gether with the chairman, form the ten members of the MSC.
The main duty of the MSC is to make such arrangements as it considers
appropriate for assisting people to select, train for, obtain and retain em¬
ployment, and for assisting employers to obtain suitable employees. Its
responsibilities include running the offices of the employment service, the
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) Service, the Occupational
Guidance Service and other employment services, operating the Training
Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) and co-ordinating the activities of the in¬
dustrial training boards (see p. 340).
The MSC carries out its functions within a general policy framework
agreed with the Secretary of State, and is responsible for expenditure in excess
of £100 million a year. Most of its activities are financed from public funds,
and it receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Department of Employment.
The MSC is advised by a network of local consultative committees on which
employers, employees and other local interests are represented, so that it may
secure the full benefit of local knowledge and the co-operation of employers
and employees.
While many of the employment and training functions of the Secretary of
State have been transferred to the MSC, he retains responsibility for general
manpower policy, manpower aspects of regional policy and regional economic
planning, and for the Department’s unit for manpower studies, the race rela¬
tions employment advisory service, certain executive duties under the Race
Relations Act 1968 (see p. 144), certain functions in relation to redundancy
payments, the issue of work permits to immigrants and international aspects
of employment and training matters, the conciliation and advisory service,
and the wages inspectorate. Management of unemployment benefit has
been separated from that of the employment services and is administered
under a regional benefit manager at each of the Department’s regional
offices.
Employment offices provide a comprehensive service for employers needing
staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking jobs.
Information and advice on any employment problem is available to all. Use
of the service is voluntary. Employers and individuals alike remain free to use
general or specialised fee-charging private employment agencies and direct
recruitment by advertisement or personal introduction. There are some 1,000
local offices, which find jobs for 1 -9 million people a year (some 20 per cent of
the job changes in Britain).
The employment offices handle the full range of occupations and deal with
full-time, part-time and temporary vacancies. Details of unfilled vacancies (or
of people seeking jobs) can be circulated quickly in the ‘travel to work’ area,
or more widely if necessary.

Employment offices are being replaced by Jobcentres which provide self-
service facilities in addition to other services. The first Jobcentre was opened
in Reading in May 1973 and a network of 800 is to be in operation by the end
of the 1970s.
A commercial employment service (office and shop work) is available at all
employment offices and also at a number of commercial employment offices. In
the hotel and catering industry a specialist service is based on the Hotel and
Catering Trades Exchange in London, and 20 hotel and catering trades
sections elsewhere.
The Regular Forces Resettlement Service, in which the Department of
Employment collaborates with the Ministry of Defence and the voluntary
organisations concerned with ex-regulars, helps members of the Forces to
achieve a satisfactory transition to civilian life.
In areas where there are large groups of hospitals, there are specially trained
officers in the employment service to deal with the employment problems of
nurses, midwives and those in related occupations or who wish to enter those
professions. Elsewhere nursing employment work is done as part of the general
employment service.
In large scale redundancy situations, teams of officers from local employ¬
ment offices visit firms to assist in the redeployment of redundant workers to
new jobs or training.
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) provides a specialised service
for men and women looking for professional, managerial, technical and
scientific appointments. Each of the 38 offices is staffed by experienced con¬
sultants who can quickly identify job opportunities in any part of the country
by use of a computer assisted matching and selection system. The service is
free to candidates, while employers are charged a fee on all successful placings
based on the starting salary.
The Occupational Guidance Service is available in 44 centres of population. It
is available free to anybody over the age of 18 who has left school and who
wishes to take expert advice before choosing or changing his occupation.
Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 young people in Great Britain
have a choice of employment services. Those under the age of 18 may use
either the services of the Employment Service Agency (see p. 336)—which
will provide for their particular needs—or the Careers Service provided by
local education authorities; those over that age may continue to use the
Careers Service. In addition, all local education authorities have a duty to
provide a vocational guidance service for people attending educational
institutions (except universities) and an employment service for those leaving
them.
In Northern Ireland the functions of the Youth Employment Service are
similar to those in Great Britain but its organisation is different in that the
service is operated by a statutory board composed of representatives of local
education authorities and other educational and industrial interests.
The Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled people
to get and keep suitable work. It is available to anyone over school-leaving age
who is substantially handicapped. From October 1974, it will be run through
the Employment Service Agency (see p. 336). All aspects of the service are
under review.

Vocational guidance and help in finding jobs is given at employment offices
by specialised disablement resettlement officers (DROs) who, where necessary,
arrange for a course of industrial rehabilitation or training or both. A Register
of Disabled Persons is maintained and all employers of 20 or more persons are
required to employ a quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except
shipping in respect of the manning of ships) of registered disabled persons.
Industrial rehabilitation is provided at 26 units (including one linked with a
medical rehabilitation unit). Attendance at a unit is voluntary and main¬
tenance allowances are paid. Financial assistance is also given to various
voluntary and other organisations operating approved industrial rehabilita¬
tion.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at skillcentres (see
p. 340), educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more
seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges run by
voluntary organisations with the help of the Training Services Agency. Grants
are available to disabled people qualified to undertake study or training for
professional or comparable employment.
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making company, partly supported by public
funds, provides sheltered employment for about 8,000 registered severely dis¬
abled people who are unlikely to obtain work except under special conditions.
The Department of Employment helps local authorities and voluntary
organisations with the cost of providing facilities for sheltered employment for
3,245 severely disabled sighted workers and for 2,300 blind workers.
As part of the policy of assisting geographical mobility of labour within
Britain to balance resources and demands, the department also makes grants
and allowances to help with costs of fares, temporary lodging and acquisition
of and removal to a new home, in specified instances. They are available to
unemployed workers moving away from home to take up employment; to key
workers transferred by a firm into a development or intermediate area to
inaugurate a new plant; and to local unemployed workers recruited to new
plants in areas of high unemployment and sent to the parent works for pre¬
liminary training.
The Government offers incentives both to encourage industrial expansion and
reduce unemployment in the assisted areas (see p. 205). The incentives include
grants towards the cost of new buildings and equipment; help with training;
and a regional employment subsidy.
In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Common¬
wealth citizens who do not have the right of abode, see p. 13, but excluding
nationals of European Community countries) need a work permit issued by
the Department of Employment. This must be obtained by the prospective
employer and is issued for a specific job and for a fixed initial period not
exceeding 12 months in the first instance. People admitted as holders of work
permits may change their jobs with the approval of the department and
normally their stay is extended if they remain in approved employment. After
four years’ approved employment the time limit on their stay may be removed
and a worker may change employment without restriction. The issue of work
permits is controlled by the Department of Employment in the light of the
availability of suitable manpower from the resident population and subject to
certain conditions regarding wages.
Nationals of the European Community countries do not require permits
EMPLOYMENT
339
Race Relations
(see below) but for other overseas workers permits are in general issued only
for work requiring a professional qualification, skill or experience, where the
Department of Employment is satisfied that the worker is necessary, where
suitable resident labour is not available to fill the post offered and where the
wages and conditions are not less favourable than those generally available in
the area for similar work. Subject to an annual quota for men, unskilled and
semi-skilled as well as skilled workers may, however, be admitted for work in
the hotel and catering industry. Single men, women, and married men coming
for joint employment with their wives are admitted for resident domestic
work but permits are not issued to those known to have dependants. Common¬
wealth citizens and foreign nationals (other than nationals of European Com¬
munity countries) are generally eligible for permits on the same terms. In
addition Commonwealth citizens may be admitted for fixed periods of
training ‘on the job’ arranged in advance and approved by the Department of
Employment. Foreign nationals may also enter Britain as student employees
on a short-term basis to enable them to improve their English.
In Northern Ireland employment permits are required for non-Northern
Ireland workers. Legislation defines Northern Ireland workers and makes
certain occupations exempt.
The European Community regulations, now enforced in Great Britain,
establish the rights of workers to move freely between member states for the
purposes of employment. In Northern Ireland there is a transitional period
of about five years before this applies. Workers entering another member state
are entitled to be treated in the same way as nationals of that state as regards
facilities of the national employment services, pay and working conditions,
trade union rights, vocational training and retraining facilities, access to
housing and property, and insurance and industrial injuries benefits. Workers
who wish to remain in the United Kingdom for longer than six months must
obtain a residence permit. If they are in permanent employment the residence
permit will be valid for five years. If the employment is temporary (that is,
expected to be of less than 12 months’ duration) the permit will be valid for the
expected duration of the employment.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements for
assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in other
member countries.
Race relations employment advisers, based in the Department of Employ¬
ment’s regional offices, provide advice and information to employers, trade
unions, and other organisations with the aim of improving employment
opportunities for immigrant workers.
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING
Most industrial and commercial training has always been carried out by indivi¬
dual employers, but in recent years the Government has taken a number of
measures based on the need to provide trained manpower to sustain the growth
of the economy, and to provide opportunities for people to make the best use of
their skills in the right jobs and to acquire new skills when old ones are no
longer in demand. Since 1st January 1974, the Manpower Services Commis¬
sion (MSC) operating through its Training Services Agency (see p. 336) is
responsible for managing and developing the country’s training programme.

The framework of training in industry and commerce is mainly based on the
Industrial Training Act 1964, as revised by the Employment and Training
Act 1973. There are 23 industrial training boards and the Foundry Industry
Training Committee appointed to be responsible for the quantity and quality
of industrial training in the industry concerned; 14 million employees or about
61 per cent of those in industry and commerce are covered.
Under the Employment and Training Act 1973 most of the Secretary of
State for Employment’s previous responsibilities for exercising control over
the activities of industrial training boards have passed to the Manpower
Services Commission. Exchequer funds are available to cover the boards’
operating expenses, including advisory services and for grants for certain key
training activities; the boards also have powers to raise levies to finance other
training activities. The previous levy/grant system is replaced by a levy/grant/
exemption system and the levy rate normally limited to 1 per cent of employers’
payrolls. The boards’ plans and budgets are agreed with the Training Services
Agency for a running 5-year period.
A body sponsored by the MSC is the Industrial Training Service (ITS)
which is independent and non-profit-making and helps companies, employers’
associations and industrial training boards in any industry in the identification
of training needs, the formulation of training policy, job analysis for any
occupational categories, training programme design and the assessment of
training effectiveness.
The Government Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) is intended to
supplement the training given by industry by providing individuals over the
age of 19 with the opportunity to acquire a skill or to retrain. Training is
carried out at over 50 skillcentres (SCs) which are within easy reach of the
main industrial areas of the country. Courses are available in over 60 different
trades. Most courses last for six months but a few are longer. Training under
the scheme is also provided in colleges and employers’ establishments. For
severely disabled people training is provided at four residential training
colleges run by voluntary organisations with government financial assistance.
Trainees are paid allowances which vary according to the number of their
dependants and their former earnings. Allowances are substantially higher than
unemployment benefit.
The Government is expanding the scheme substantially. Some 40,000
people were trained under TOPS in 1973, and it is hoped to train 70,000 to
75,000 in 1976.
The Government also offers industry a wide range of training facilities outside
the scope of the TOPS. The Training Within Industry Scheme (TWI) is in¬
tended to develop the skills of supervisors in instructing and communicating,
in improving methods and in preventing accidents. Special courses are avail¬
able for supervisors employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals, and
for staff engaged in export procedures, and there is also an in-plant training
development service to aid selection and further the training of operatives and
clerks as instructors. Courses in industrial instruction techniques are available
to firms and SC staff at the Training Services Agency’s two Instructor Training
Colleges (one in England and one in Scotland) and at six Instructor Training
Units attached to SCs.
Training services at SCs, TWI courses, and courses at Instructor Training
Colleges are available to trainees from overseas under approved schemes (for
instance, those of the International Labour Organisation or technical assist-

ance provided jointly by the Department of Employment and the Ministry of
Overseas Development).
Certain training services, previously available free to firms expanding in
assisted areas, are now available to all firms; these services comprise the training
of firms’ own instructors, training of experienced workers in instructional
techniques, provision of mobile instructors to train people in employers’ own
premises, and training of supervisors.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Though Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation
for the safety, health and welfare of employees and in providing certain legal
immunities for trade unions, until recently there were relatively few legal
restrictions on the right of an employer to hire an employee on any terms which
he would accept and to dismiss him at will. The employee in general looked
to his trade union to protect him. The determination by statute of minimum
wages, holidays and holiday pay was in principle confined to those trades
and industries where the organisation of employers or workers, or both, was
inadequate to negotiate collective agreements and to ensure their observance
(see p. 345). However, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 (see
below) and other recent legislation provides considerable safeguards for the
employee in his terms of employment as well as working conditions. The
Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, as amended under recent
legislation, provides machinery, under certain conditions, for enforcing the
observance of terms or conditions established by collective agreement. The
Contracts of Employment Act 1972 requires an employer to give an employee
comprehensive information on terms and conditions of employment, and
the procedure available to him where he has a grievance about his employ¬
ment ; it also lays down the right of both employers and employees to minimum
periods of notice when employment is to be terminated. Under the Redundancy
Payments Acts 1965 and 1969 employees with a minimum period of service
of 104 weeks are entitled to lump sum payments if their jobs cease to exist (for
example, because of technological improvements or because of a fall in demand)
and their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work, the cost being
partly met from a fund subscribed to by industry as a whole. The Trade
Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 gives protection against unfair dismissal
by providing machinery under which an employee may bring an action against
an employer for unfair dismissal, and seek re-engagement or compensation;
gives legal support to the right to trade union organisation by making it
illegal to dismiss, or to discriminate against, a person because he is or proposes
to become a member of an independent trade union; gives protection on
reasonable grounds for people not wishing to be members of an independent
trade union, where a union membership agreement is in force; and lays down
that written collective agreements between trade unions and employers are
presumed to be intended to be legally binding only if they contain a provision
to that effect.
The Race Relations Act 1968 (see p. 144) makes it illegal for an employer
to discriminate on the grounds of race, colour or ethnic or national origin in
the engagement, dismissal or employment of workers.
Other legislation prescribes minimum standards of safety, health and welfare
in most places of employment (see pp. 350-4). However, it is recognised that
the causes of many accidents are not amenable to statutory control. Therefore,

voluntary action taken by employer organisations, often in association with
trade unions, is encouraged.
Minimum entitlements for many manual workers are determined by national
collective agreements or statutory wages regulation orders. For men these
range from about ^0*30 to j£i ’oo per hour. Separate rates for men and women
are less frequently specified as the date for full implementation of the Equal
Pay Act 1970 approaches. Many employers pay above the national minima.
Higher rates are also usually paid for shift-work and overtime, and weekly
earnings may be further increased by piecework rates and other incentive
schemes. Piecework rates are of declining importance in a number of industries,
where methods of production tend to dictate the output of a worker.
On the basis of the latest survey in a series conducted regularly by the
Department of Employment into earnings and hours of work in manufacturing
industries and some non-manufacturing industries throughout Britain, the
average earnings of full-time male adult manual workers in October 1973 were
j£o*9o an hour and £40-92 a week. Full-time women manual workers at the
same date earned an average of £0-56 an hour and £21 -16 a week.
Minimum time rates for women manual workers tend to be lower than the
corresponding male rate, though the gap is gradually closing. Women’s earn¬
ings are markedly lower than those of men, partly because on average they
work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates, but also because
a smaller proportion of women do skilled work. The Equal Pay Act 1970
provides that from 29th December 1975 a woman doing the same or broadly
similar work to a man will qualify for equal pay and conditions of employment.
Between October 1963 and October 1973 average weekly wage rates in¬
creased by 123 per cent and the average weekly earnings of manual workers,
before tax and national insurance deductions, by 153 per cent. Part of the in¬
crease has been offset by a rise in retail prices of about 80 per cent and by larger
national insurance contributions and income tax. The trends of earnings, wage
rates, retail prices, wages and salaries per unit of output from 1964 to 1973 are
shown in the diagram opposite.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary, often on a scale carrying annual increases, and such careers
generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher remunera¬
tion. Starting salaries may be in the range of ^1,500-^1,800 (lower for trainees
in their teens and higher for some graduates entering industry). The average
weekly earnings of full-time non-manual adult workers in April 1973 were
about ^48 for men and £25 for women. On average, salaries doubled between
1963 and 1973.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £6,000 to £12,000 a year gross before tax. The posts with
salaries in the range of £15,000 to £25,000 a year include those of Cabinet
Ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in govern¬
ment departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily
newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher
managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. The earnings of a few
persons in business, star entertainers and certain other very successful people
exceed £50,000 a year gross.
A Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth was set up
in July 1974 to inquire into, and to report on, such matters concerning the
distribution of personal incomes, both earned and unearned, and wealth as

may be referred to it by the Government. The commission, whose setting up
forms an integral part of government policy on industrial relations and collec¬
tive bargaining, will work in close co-operation with other bodies involved.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. As civil servants, Ministers of the Crown,
Members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and solicitors, and in journalism,
broadcasting and architecture they are paid the same salary as men for doing
the same kind of work. Women in independent professions are not expected
to charge lower fees than men. As already stated equal pay as between men
and women will be enforced in all occupations from the end of 1975 (see p. 342).
The normal working week in Britain is in the range 39-40 hours for manual
work and 37-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked by men in manual occupations are usually somewhat
longer than their normal hours, on account of overtime; in October 1973 they
were 45-6 compared with 37-7 for women. Men and women in non-manual
occupations generally work little or no overtime, although senior salaried staff
may from time to time be required to work substantial (unpaid) overtime.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades—the maximum, with

limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for
6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act (see p. 350) for
adult women over 18 and young people between 16 and 18. The employment
of women and young people at night is prohibited in industrial undertakings,
except for young men over 16 working in some continuous-process industries
(subject to certain conditions). The Department of Employment can make
exemptions from these restrictions on grounds of public interest. In general
the hours of work of adult men are not restricted by statute.
With few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus¬
tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
of at least three weeks and over one-half have basic entitlements of more than
three weeks, in addition to public holidays. Non-manual workers generally
have higher entitlements than manual workers. Some agreements, particularly
in the non-manual sector, provide for extended holidays related to length of
service, or status, or both.
Payment is made for public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to
Good Friday and Christmas Day there are public holidays in England and
Wales on New Year’s Day, Easter Monday, the last Monday in May or first in
June, the last Monday in August or first in September and the first weekday
after Christmas (Boxing Day); and in Scotland on New Year’s Day, 2nd
January (in the civil service, banks and most major industries but on another
additional day elsewhere), the last Monday in May or first in June and the last
Monday in August or first in September. Northern Ireland observes all the
English holidays and, in addition, has a holiday on St. Patrick’s Day (17th
March) and on 12th July; the Tuesday after Easter is also a customary holiday
for industry and trade.
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. It has been estimated
that at the end of 1971 ii*i million employees were covered by occupational
pension schemes. Many employees are also covered by occupational sick pay
schemes (additional or complementary to the State schemes, see p. 125). A
smaller number are covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the
statutory minimum (see p. 341). Such benefits are more usual among clerical
and professional employees receiving a standard salary than among manual
workers with a chance to earn overtime and other additions to their pay.
Senior members of firms may use a company car and some firms provide
profit-sharing schemes and share-saving schemes under the ‘Save As You
Earn’ scheme (see p. 368).
The Office of Manpower Economics was established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, with three functions: to act as secretariat for the three
review bodies set up to advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the
public sector for which negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as
Members of Parliament, the judiciary, the armed forces, and doctors and
dentists; to service enquiries on particular pay structures and related problems;
and to carry out research on more general matters affecting pay and manpower,
either at the request or with the approval of ministers.
The structure of labour relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system rests mainly on the organisation of employers and
workers into employers’ associations and trade unions. These organisations
discuss and negotiate terms and conditions of employment and other matters

affecting people at their work. In the past the emphasis has been on detailed
industry-wide agreements supplemented as necessary by local agreements in
firms or factories, but a gradual change of attitudes and structure has led to
more emphasis being placed on formal agreements at firm and factory level. In
some industries, firms and factories, negotiations are conducted simply by
meetings of employers’ and employees’ representatives, which are held when
necessary; in others, voluntary joint councils or committees have been
established on a permanent basis. The scope of the various joint bodies—from
the national joint industrial councils for whole industries to the works councils
and committees in individual workplaces—varies widely. Some of them only
negotiate. Others discuss a wide range of topics. But the scope of the bodies is
tending to widen and the distinction between discussion (or consultation) and
negotiation to become blurred. Normally these arrangements for collective
bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but provision is
sometimes made for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to
independent arbitration.
Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the
Government, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) (see p. 346), the
Trades Union Congress (TUC) (see p. 347) and the nationalised industries
through the National Economic Development Council on matters in which
employers and workers have a common interest. The operation of collective
bargaining has from time to time been restricted in the national interest by
government policies to combat inflation (see p. 192).
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to extend
by research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations
in industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by
the Social Science Research Council (see p. 409) and the Medical Research
Council (see p. 403). Voluntary organisations include bodies which deal with
management problems and provide a service to subscribing firms; professional
associations, linking individuals with a common interest in particular functions
of management; and bodies providing specialist services, usually on a fee¬
paying basis.
In a number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers or
employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known
as wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three
independent members. Wages councils may submit proposals for fixing mini¬
mum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Secretary of State who must
then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals, subject only to his
right to return them as a whole for further consideration by the councils. The
Department of Employment’s Wages Inspectorate helps employers and workers
to interpret the provisions of wage regulation orders and sees that they are
complied with. About 3*25 million workers are covered by such arrangements.
Agricultural wages boards (there are separate boards for England and Wales
and for Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment in
agriculture.
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 defines the status of trade
unions and employers’ associations and sets out certain legal requirements
which they must observe. It confers responsibilities on them in respect of

actions taken in the course of a trade dispute; confirms the right to picket
peacefully and also provides that collective agreements shall not be legally
enforceable unless they specifically provide for this. Workers are given the
right not to be unfairly dismissed and their right to belong to an independent
trade union is safeguarded.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations wholly
or partly concerned with labour questions. The primary aims of such organisa¬
tions are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of employment,
including a sound wage structure and proper standards of safety, health and
welfare; to promote good relations with employees and the efficient use of
manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which may arise.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section
of an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole
of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national federations, while in others,
within which different firms are engaged in making different principal pro¬
ducts, there is a complex structure with national and regional federations for
these different sections of the industry as well as for the industry as a whole.
Although there are some 1,400 employers’ organisations dealing with labour
matters, most of these are local branches of national organisations. There are
over 100 of these, most of which belong to the CBI and they negotiate the
national collective agreements for their industry with the trade unions
concerned.
The final authority of a local or small national organisation may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local organisa¬
tions or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to
ratify their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the
organisation’s day-to-day work. There is usually a small working group,
consisting of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal
with urgent questions and co-ordinate the work of committees.
The principal organisation representing employers is the CBI, which deals
with all matters (not only labour relations) affecting the interests of employers
and represents them nationally to the Government and the public and also
internationally, for instance, in the International Labour Organisation and in
the various institutions of the European Communities. It is also the British
member of UNICE (the organisation of industrial federations of the European
Community). The majority of national employers’ organisations and national¬
ised industries and a large number of individual companies, both large and
small, belong to the CBI. Its representatives sit on various government
advisory committees, on other statutory bodies, such as the Manpower Services
Commission, and on voluntary bodies concerned with labour matters.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form
and organisation vary considerably as do their traditions and attitudes. Trade
EMPLOYMENT
347
unions started more than two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen
and spread later to the general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently
trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and
administrative workers. The qualification for membership of some unions
is occupational (for instance, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever
employed), while in most others the qualification is industrial (that is, they
seek to recruit all employees in an industry, whatever their occupation). In
many unions recruitment is based on a combination of these principles.
At the end of 1972 the total membership of British trade unions was about
11 million. There were 466 unions, but over 77 per cent of all trade unionists
were in the 25 largest unions each with a membership of 100,000 or over,
while under 1 per cent were in the 232 smaller unions with under 1,000
members each.
The number of trade unionists has increased during the last decade but the
number of unions has fallen owing to amalgamations. In Northern Ireland
some 80 per cent of trade unionists are members of unions with headquarters
in Great Britain.
The Registrar of Friendly Societies is required to maintain a list of trade
unions. To be eligible for entry on the list their principal purposes must
include the regulation of relations between workers and employers, or between
workers’ and employers’ associations or their constituent or affiliated organisa¬
tions.
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to annual conferences of delegates
from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest authority
of unions, and carry out policy decisions made by conference delegates. Most
unions also have regional and district organisations. At the level of the indivi¬
dual member there are local branches, covering one or more factories. Members
may attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and conditions
of employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the election of
the union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered to
be entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on wider issues
for action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The organising of
members in individual places of work, and the negotiation of local factory/plant
pay agreements with managements, may be done by full-time district officials
of the union or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’, who are chosen by their
fellow members in the place of work to represent them. Trade unions vary in
the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into their organisation.
Where two or more unions have members in the same workplace, shop
stewards’ committees may be formed to discuss matters of common concern.
Unions often provide dispute benefit (‘strike pay’) for members involved
in official industrial action. They also provide legal advice for members who
suffer injury or contract diseases at work, and may pay members’ legal costs
where a case for compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in case
of illness, accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under
the national insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions.
Many trade unions support the Labour Party financially.
Trades Union
Congress
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC, which
celebrated its centenary in 1968. The TUC’s objects are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and social
conditions of working people. Its membership comprises 126 organisations,
some of which are themselves federations of smaller organisations. Together
348 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
they represent about 10 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general
questions which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and
gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or industries.
The Congress, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a week every
year to discuss matters of concern to trade unionists and to employees generally.
It elects annually a General Council which represents it during the remaining
51 weeks of the year. This is responsible for carrying out Congress decisions,
for watching economic and social developments, for providing educational and
advisory services to unions, and for presenting to the Government the trade
union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. It is also empowered
to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances and its activities for
this purpose were enlarged following a special Congress in June 1969 and subse¬
quent agreement with the Government. The General Council undertook to use
its authority to deal with unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages of work,
as well as the inter-union and official disputes with which it had dealt pre¬
viously.
Both the TUC and many unions conduct extensive educational services for
members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade unionism and
industrial relations principles and practice.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through
its affiliations to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
and the European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British
workers’ delegate to the International Labour Conference.
The 1973 Congress adopted proposals for the establishment of eight TUC
regional councils in England, based on the Government’s eight planning
regions (see p. 190), with a further similar body for Wales known as the Wales
Trades Union Council. These bodies, whose function is to make representa¬
tions to the Government’s various regional bodies, came into operation in
May 1974 and replaced the previous twelve TUC regional advisory com¬
mittees. They also co-ordinate the activities of trade unions in the regions,
and keep them in touch with the policy of the TUC at national level.
Scotland and Scottish trade unionists have also their own national central body, the Scottish
Northern Ireland Trades Union Congress (STUC) which is similar in constitution and functions
to the TUC. Trade Unions with Scottish membership may affiliate to the
STUC and a number of trade unions are in fact affiliated to both bodies. Trade
Unions in Northern Ireland are represented by the Northern Ireland Com¬
mittee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, though the majority of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland belong to unions based in Great Britain.
State Provision
for Conciliation,
Arbitration and
Investigation
In September 1974 the Secretary of State for Employment set up an indepen¬
dent Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which is controlled by a council
consisting of a chairman and nine other members experienced in industrial
relations.
The service has the duty of offering conciliation in both the public and
private sectors where this is considered likely to be of assistance, and has
discretion in meeting requests for conciliation subject only to the need to pay
regard to agreed procedural arrangements in the industry or area of employ¬
ment concerned. Where there are such procedures, the service does not
normally intervene unless efforts to obtain a settlement within these pro¬
cedures have failed.
The service also, at the joint request of the parties in dispute and with
regard to the need to safeguard negotiating procedures, appoints single arbi-
EMPLOYMENT
349
trators or boards of arbitration chosen from a register of people experienced in
industrial relations to determine differences on the basis of agreed terms of
reference.
The Secretary of State is also empowered to appoint a court of inquiry or
committee of investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended.
These procedures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the
facts of a dispute (the report of a court of inquiry has to be laid before Parlia¬
ment). Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies
are not binding on the parties, they often provide the basis for further negotia¬
tions leading to a settlement.
Labour While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised indus-
Relations of tries are, in general, organised on the same principle as in private industry,
Public Authorities there are some special features.
Central and Local Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
Government conditions of service are dealt with by the Civil Service Department (see p.
45), are permitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service trade
unions and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consul¬
tation by means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils (see p.
62). If there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or asso¬
ciation may, subject to certain limitations, report the dispute to the Secretary
of State for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent
body appointed by the Secretary of State by powers under the Industrial
Courts Act 1919. Government industrial employees are similarly encouraged to
belong to trade unions and machinery exists for joint consultation. There are
four Trades Joint Councils on which representatives of the Government and
the trade unions sit to consider pay and conditions of employment affecting
individual grades and certain other limited matters. A Joint Co-ordinating
Committee, on which the Government and Trades Joint Councils are repre¬
sented, deals with national pay negotiations, conditions of service and other
matters of general application. In the main employing departments there
are departmental joint councils for the discussion of domestic matters. Dis¬
putes on wages or conditions of employment that cannot be resolved by the
existing machinery can be referred to the Industrial Arbitration Board (see
above).
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils
for the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
employees) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other
matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
Nationalised The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
Industries arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint con¬
sultation with their employees; in carrying out these duties they are free to
choose suitable arrangements. The main difference from private industry is
that the corporations are not usually members of employers’ associations
(although the majority are ‘public sector members’ of the CBI). In some indus¬
tries they are sole or main employers, but even where part of the industry is in
private hands, as for example in road transport, the corporations are separately
and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, to deal with local implications but not

normally to negotiate separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the
facilities for arbitration offered to industry generally by the Department of
Employment (see p. 48), but coalmining and rail transport have their own
special arrangements. Consultations at all levels, including the workplace, have
been arranged in all the nationalised industries.
As in many other countries time lost through industrial disputes has risen in
Britain in recent years, though it is still very much less than time lost through
sickness, accidents and absenteeism. In 1972, when major disputes occurred
in coalmining, docks, engineering and building, nearly 24 million working days
were lost, involving some 1*7 million employees; but this figure dropped
sharply in 1973, when only 7-2 million working days were lost, involving some
1-5 million employees.
Northern Ireland has its own system of industrial relations under which
certain powers and responsibilities devolve upon the Department of Man¬
power Services.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their em¬
ployees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of
care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards of safety in
certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number of statutes;
some of these also deal with health and welfare. The Health and Safety at
Work etc. Act was introduced by the Government in July 1974 to reorganise
the system under which safety and health at work are safeguarded, to extend it
(with effect from 1st April 1975) to cover initially everyone at work and to
further the protection of the general public from industrial hazards.
A Health and Safety Commission, with members representing employers,
trade unions and local authorities, is to be set up on 1st October 1974, together
with an Executive, to be established on 1st January 1975. These will take over
responsibility for the existing government inspectorates covering factories,
mines and quarries, explosives, nuclear installations and alkali works, and to
develop and carry out policy on health and safety matters.
From 1 st January 1975 the basic obligations laid down in the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 will be supported by Ministerial powers to make
regulations dealing with particular hazards to health and safety issued by the
commission and by codes of practice for improving standards of protection
of employees and the public in specific situations. In particular the Act gives
inspectors the power to issue improvement and prohibition notices, which
enable them to require practical improvements to be made within a specified
time or to require preventive measures immediately without first having to
obtain a court order. There are provisions for appeals to industrial tribunals
against such notices.
About 270,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks and
construction sites) are regulated under the Factories Act 1961, which is
enforced by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Factories (to be transferred to the
new Health and Safety Executive). About 750,000 premises are subject to the
Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, whose enforcement is shared
by Her Majesty’s Inspectorates of Factories and of Mines and Quarries
(also to be transferred to the new Executive), and local authorities.
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the health,
safety and welfare of employees, and deal with such matters as the fencing of
machinery; precautions against fire and special risks; the safe condition of the

premises; and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation. Anyone in¬
tending to employ other people in industrial or commercial premises to which
the Acts apply has to notify the enforcing authority of his intention before he
begins to employ people and every fatal accident and every accident causing
more than three days’ incapacity must be reported. The Factories Act includes
provisions for the compulsory notification and investigation of certain danger¬
ous occurrences, for precautions against dangerous substances and about the
employment of women and young people.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and quarries
under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954; two statutes are concerned with
agriculture—the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and the Agri¬
culture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956; and specialised
statutes and delegated legislation are concerned with transport—the Railway
Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, the Merchant Shipping
Acts, the Road Traffic Acts and the Air Navigation Order and Regulations.
As with the Factories Act these other provisions are, with some exceptions,
enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (to be
part of the new Health and Safety Executive), the Agricultural Inspectorate
of the agricultural departments, and the Railway Employment Inspectorate of
the Department of the Environment. (The Health and Safety at Work etc.
Act 1974 provides for separate administration of the Agricultural and Railway
Employment Inspectorates, and for the Building Regulations, which are the
responsibility of the Department of the Environment.) The Department of
Trade is responsible for administering the Merchant Shipping Acts and for
safety in air transport (most of the powers in respect of airworthiness are
delegated to the Civil Aviation Authority, see p. 323), and the Department of
the Environment is responsible for road and rail transport safety matters.
Safety requirements in hotels, places of entertainment or educational establish¬
ments are covered by the 1971 Fire Precautions Act or (in respect of their
offices and shops) by the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. The Health
and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 amends this Act to allow for the transfer to
fire authorities of responsibilities for general fire precautions and means of
escape. The Radiological Protection Act 1970 has been amended to provide
for co-ordination of the activities of the commission and the National
Radiological Protection Board (see p. 398).
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by
improving the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment, by traffic
regulation and control of standards of maintenance and by training crews in
competency and safety awareness.
To safeguard the many interests which might be adversely affected by the
use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a voluntary scheme is operated
by the Government with the help of an advisory committee and with the full
co-operation of the chemical industry.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation—a Standing Com¬
mittee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety engineers at divisions,
areas and the largest collieries.
The Health and Safety Commission will encourage the development of volun¬
tary central organisation within each industry at national level for the considera¬
tion of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention. Its

Factory Inspectorate, besides enquiring into notified accidents and safety
aspects of machine design and specification, circulates expert advice by per¬
sonal exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourages the appointment of
safety officers and the formation of works safety committees, and maintains an
industrial health and safety centre in London, at which various types of
machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards are displayed, as well as a
wide range of protective clothing and equipment.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory
committees appointed by the Secretary of State. Representatives of the Trades
Union Congress, the Confederation of British Industry, the nationalised
industries and other interests meet on the Industrial Safety Advisory Council
under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety Council are two major
national bodies concerned with accident prevention. A number of local acci¬
dent prevention groups are affiliated to either RoSPA or the British Safety
Council. These groups serve as forums where questions of industrial safety
can be examined and knowledge of accident prevention exchanged.
Training is important in accident prevention and the Training Services Agency
(see p. 336) provides a safety course in its TWI scheme and the industrial
training boards include specific provisions for safety training in their training
recommendations (see p. 340).
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences', its
regional industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-
level managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses.
Other courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisa¬
tions such as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems
of guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, protective
personal equipment, construction methods, fires and explosions, psychological
factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in particular sectors of
industry. A register of research into industrial health and safety matters has
been compiled by the Department of Employment to give an indication of the
scale and nature of research being undertaken. Industrial research associations
include among their more purely economic research projects the improvement
of working conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a
direct bearing on safety. In addition, the Department of Energy has a statutory
responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of coal miners.
This responsibility is largely exercised through its Safety in Mines Research
Establishment (to be transferred to the Health and Safety Executive in
January 1975).
The University of Aston has established a Chair in Safety and Hygiene to
help meet the need for academically trained safety officers and engineers whose
careers will be concerned with the technical aspects of insurance and forensic
work.
Local authorities have power, under the Public Health Acts, to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation at places of work and to treat

workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances
the abatement of which can be enforced. Factories, certain other industrial
premises, offices, shops and railway premises must comply with the health and
welfare requirements of the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act. These include: the cleanliness of workrooms, adequate ventila¬
tion and suitable temperature and lighting, the avoidance of overcrowding and
the provision of sanitary accommodation, and the protection of workers
against inhaling harmful dust or fumes; and the provision of washing facilities,
lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking water, first aid
and seats.
Legislation, besides forbidding employment of children under 13 years of
age, forbids the employment of children who have not reached the statutory
minimum school-leaving age (see p. 151) in any industrial undertaking; of
women and young people underground in mines and in certain other danger¬
ous occupations (for example, certain processes connected with lead manufac¬
ture); and of women in factories and workshops within four weeks after
childbirth. It also limits and defines the permissible hours of employment for
women and young people (see p. 344). Local authorities, moreover, have wide
powers under the Children and Young Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as the
Education Acts 1944-48, to regulate hours and conditions of employment of
children within their areas.
There are special arrangements for the medical care of people at work. The
former Appointed Factory Doctor Service of the Department of Employment,
which dealt mainly with the periodic medical examination of young people in
industrial establishments and of workers in certain hazardous occupations,
was replaced in February 1973 by the department’s Employment Medical
Advisory Service (EMAS), under the Employment Medical Advisory Service
Act 1972. (Responsibility for running the service is to be delegated to the new
Health and Safety Executive.) EMAS provides a nation-wide service of
advice on the medical aspects of employment problems to employers, em¬
ployees, trade unions, doctors and others. In particular it carries out the
periodic medical examination of workers in hazardous occupations as required
under factories legislation, and in conjunction with school medical officers and
careers officers advises young people who are starting work and whose school
medical records reveal a need for special care in choice of employment.
The service, headed by a Chief Employment Medical Adviser, has over 100
employment medical advisers who will be based in the country’s main
industrial centres. An EMAS committee has been set up to advise the depart¬
ment on the development of the service. Its members are nominated by the
Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, and other
interested organisations.
Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees over
and above the statutory requirements. It is estimated that there are some 397
factories with doctors providing full-time medical cover and some 3,922
factories with part-time medical cover. In addition several thousand nurses are
employed in industry. The big employers, including the State and the boards
of nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a number of smaller factories
also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined together in group
medical services. The Secretary of State is advised on measures to further the
development of health services in workplaces covered by the Factories Act by
the Industrial Health Advisory Committee, which includes members nomi¬
nated by the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress,

the nationalised industries, the British Medical Association, the Royal College

industrial health.
The Factory Inspectorate gives advice on occupational hygiene problems and
has an industrial hygiene unit, with laboratory facilities. There are some six
centres in Great Britain (including the TUC’s Institute of Occupational
Health) which undertake studies of particular problems or health risks and also
carry out routine physical, chemical and biological tests for industry.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medical
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social
medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and large
industrial concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory
Inspectorate, which has specialised technical branches.
An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facili¬
ties. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become
usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many offices
and shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have
adopted luncheon voucher schemes.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which, with some exceptions, is similar to that in
Great Britain and is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965
and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. A number of
firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and industrial safety groups, sup¬
ported by representatives of industry, insurance companies and public
authorities, make a valuable contribution to industrial accident prevention.
17 Finance
THE PUBLIC SECTOR
PUBLIC
EXPENDITURE
Public expenditure comprises the current and capital expenditures of central
Government and local authorities, together with the debt interest and capital
expenditure of the nationalised industries and other public corporations.
Public expenditure in 1973-74 amounted to about ^33,800 million, of which
60 per cent was by the central Government, 32 per cent by local authorities,
and 8 per cent, the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries and other
public corporations.
The wide range of functions and purposes of this expenditure and its
distribution is shown in Table 29.
Between 1963 and 1973 total public expenditure grew in real terms by
61 per cent.
The social services programmes now take 41 per cent of the total, whereas
in i960 they represented just over 35 per cent. On the other hand defence
expenditure has declined from 17 per cent to just over 10 per cent.

.£19,900 million or 59 per cent was spent by the public sector directly on goods
and services (wages and salaries, other current expenditure on goods and
services, gross domestic fixed capital formation and stocks). Transfer pay¬
ments to individuals, companies and other institutions in the private sector
(for example, social security payments, capital grants, subsidies, and debt
interest) made up the balance of public expenditure. Unlike public authorities’
direct purchases of goods and services, transfer payments do not represent a
direct demand on the nation’s resources. The gross sums transferred create a
proportionately lower indirect demand for goods and services because of taxes
paid and savings made by the recipients.
Up to i960 discussion of public expenditure centred on the expenditure of the
central Government departments, including grants to local authorities, set
out in the annual Supply Estimates which were presented to and approved by
Parliament for one year ahead. These Estimates did not (and do not) cover
certain major areas of public expenditure, such as the nationalised industries’
capital expenditure, the bulk of the payments from the national insurance fund,
and local authorities’ expenditure financed from the local rates (see p. 71).
Following the recommendations of the Plowden Committee on the Control of
Public Expenditure in 1961, surveys were instituted of the whole range of
public expenditure, for the period five years ahead. The surveys take place
each year, rolling forward the period to be covered. They are carried out by
officials in the Treasury and other government departments, under the
direction of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee.
The primary purpose of the survey is to present to ministers an up-to-date
assessment of the cost of their existing policies as a basis for decisions about
the total and the composition of public expenditure over the whole area over
which the Government has control or influence. The five-year period covered
by the surveys gives the Government the opportunity to plan ahead significant
changes without causing wasteful disruption in existing services, and to have
regard to the overall economic outlook when taking decisions.
The initial recosting normally takes place in the first half of the year, to be
followed by ministerial consideration of the survey report. Since 1969 the
public expenditure plans as settled by the Government have been published
(see Bibliography p. 477) towards the end of the year, forming the basis of an
annual public expenditure debate in the House of Commons. From 1974-75
the form of the Supply Estimates has been revised to bring them into line
with the functional classification shown in Table 29.
In 1971 the Expenditure Committee of the House was created, replacing
the Estimates Committee, to consider public expenditure, and its reports
provide further information on which the debates can draw. The Expendi¬
ture Committee has formed sub-committees, one to consider general Govern¬
ment financial control and the presentation of information about public
expenditure, and others considering public expenditure in particular areas:
defence and external relations; education and the arts; employment and the
Home Office; social services; trade and industry; and environment. These
committees can question departmental ministers as well as their officials, and
can take evidence also from witnesses outside Government.
Each department submits its estimates to the Treasury in the December before
the financial year beginning on the following 1st April.
After they have been approved by the Treasury, the Estimates are pre¬
sented to Parliament shortly before the presentation of the Budget (see p. 358)
and are approved by Parliament, by means of an annual Appropriation Act, in

July (expenditure to this date from ist April is covered by a Vote on Account
approved by Parliament before the beginning of the financial year). There are
29 allotted days (known as supply days) in each session on which the choice
of subject for debate rests with the Opposition. Although Estimates can be
debated on these days, normally broad issues of policy are discussed.
Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts
of Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another and are
paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. These include the financial provision
for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges. The
Consolidated Fund, into which tax revenue and other receipts are paid,
finances most of the Government’s expenditure and has its balance held in the
Exchequer account at the Bank of England. The National Loans Fund, set
up in 1968, covers most of the Government’s domestic lending and borrowing,
and is operated as an official account at the Bank of England. The two funds
deal only with sterling receipts and payments; official dealings in foreign
exchange are carried out by the Exchange Equalisation Account (see p. 364).
The Treasury’s authority is required for any new item of expenditure, for any
increase in expenditure beyond that originally authorised, for any change in
policy which means an increase in expenditure, and for extra-statutory pay¬
ments. This requirement is, however, subject to any delegated authority
which may be given to departments to deal with particular types of expendi¬
ture. Treasury control does not imply final sanction by the Treasury—in the
last resort the decision is taken by the Government as a whole, and carried
out subject to Parliamentary consent.
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, a permanent officer of
the Crown. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller he controls
receipts and issues of public money to and from the Consolidated Fund and
the National Loans Fund, and as Auditor General he audits departmental
accounts and submits his report on the Appropriation Accounts and other
accounts, as required by statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to
ensure that all expenditure is properly incurred, for example, that no payments
are made which go beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury
sanction has been obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has
been encouraged by successive Public Accounts Committees (see below) to
examine departmental expenditure for cost-effectiveness with a view to draw¬
ing their attention to any cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by
the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a House of Commons
select committee called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up
in 1861 for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was properly incurred in
accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and with any relevant Acts
of Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee are simply to examine
the accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by successive com¬
mittees which have investigated whether full value has been obtained for the
sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which the administra¬
tion appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee has therefore
become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and inefficiency. It
embodies the findings in reports which may be debated in the House of Com¬
mons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury in consultation

with departments and put into effect, so far as they are accepted, according
to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is submitted to Parliament by
Treasury Minute and both documents are debated at the beginning of the
following session.
THE BUDGET The Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts)
is a set of proposals made usually once a year in either March or April, for
financing Government expenditure. The proposals are described by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget speech, against the background of
a statement of the Government’s past and prospective revenue and expendi¬
ture, and the Chancellor’s assessment of the position and prospects of the
economy as a whole.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means
resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions, when
passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Act, which
expresses the proposals in statutory form.
The Budget is principally an instrument of economic management, and the
Budget speech is normally the main occasion for a review of general economic
policy. The scale of Government expenditure and taxation has an important
influence on the general level of output and distribution of resources. The
Budget judgment is therefore concerned with the balance between the total
of goods and services which are likely to be available to the nation and the
total claims which are likely to be made on them. Taxation provides the
Government with a means of exerting a considerable influence on the pressure
of demand. Taxation measures can also have a broader influence on the
pattern of demand and the long-term performance of the economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On occa¬
sions, changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and family
allowances, have been announced in the Budget speech as have financial and
monetary measures not related to the Finance Act, such as changes in exchange
control policies. Such measures, however, are not reflected in the resolutions
or the Finance Act but are applied by whatever procedure is appropriate to
implement them—separate legislation, statutory instruments or administra¬
tive action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Act which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor’s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at the Chancellor’s disposal, and
especially by increasing or reducing the yield of central Government taxes.
The tax changes made necessary by the Budget judgment are enacted in the
Finance Act. But the Finance Act also provides the annual opportunity for
non-Budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain other financial
matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrowing.
The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates or coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the
abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery relating
to taxation. In two cases however—income tax and corporation tax—annual
Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Act clause are necessary
to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are annual taxes. It is this
which makes a Budget at or about the beginning of each financial year a
necessity.

Public Sector
Accounts
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
laws, do not come into effect until the Finance Act has received Royal Assent
(in the case of the spring Budget, normally at the end of July) or at some other
date laid down in the Bill. Some changes, however, come into effect earlier,
usually from Budget Day or from the start of the tax year, under the Provi¬
sional Collection of Taxes Act. This enables the Government to collect certain
taxes provisionally, income tax for example, either at the rates previously in
operation or at new rates following the passing of the appropriate Ways and
Means resolutions. Tax proposals may be made at other times in the year to
meet changes in economic circumstances.
The economic background to the spring Budget and the transactions of the
central Government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the
Financial Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography p. 477) which is laid
before the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when
opening the Budget. The report is in three parts: the economic context of the
Budget; the accounts of the public sector; and the accounts of the central
Government for the past financial year and the one immediately ahead. The
accounts are designed to assist in assessing the impact of changes in revenue
and, where relevant, public expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central
Government, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public cor¬
porations combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the
public sector. The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consoli¬
dation and the net balance on the consolidated account represents therefore the
borrowing required by the public sector from the private and overseas sectors.
The accounts of the central Government show transactions both on the
conventional cash basis of Exchequer accounting and in accordance with the
framework of the national income accounts.
Central Government borrowing may be in the form of borrowing from the
public either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 367) or by
borrowing on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of
government securities are made from time to time for the purpose of refinanc¬
ing maturing issues (conversion loans) or to raise new money (issues for cash).
The capital requirements of the nationalised industries are met by the central
Government through the National Loans Fund, while those of the local
authorities are met partly by the central Government through the Public
Works Loan Board and partly by borrowing directly from the public, although
some nationalised industries and local authorities have obtained statutory
power enabling them to borrow, with Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
The euro-currency market has become an increasingly important source of
public sector borrowing. After allowing for the changes introduced by the
Budget of March 1974, the central Government’s borrowing requirement
for 1974-75 was expected to be XI»525 million, compared with £2,423 million
in 1973-74 and that for the public sector as a whole £2,733 million com¬
pared with £4,276 million in 1973-74. In July 1974, the Government
announced an additional public sector borrowing requirement estimated at
£340 million.

burden of taxation away from those with low incomes. The main aim of the
Budget was to bring about a social unity that would help in arresting inflation
and reducing the balance of payments deficit.
The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
include income tax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital, which in¬
clude estate duty and capital gains tax (for proposed new taxes, see p. 362);
and third, taxes on expenditure (including taxes on the ownership or use of
certain assets)—these include protective and revenue duties, value added tax
(VAT), local rates, stamp duties and licence duties (for example, on motor
vehicles). Taxes on individual (but not corporate) incomes are progressive
taxes in that large incomes and estates bear a proportionately higher rate of
tax. The Board of Inland Revenue assesses and collects the taxes on income
and capital and the stamp duties; the Board of Customs and Excise collects
the most important taxes on expenditure, the customs and excise duties and
VAT while a variety of authorities is responsible for the collection of the
remainder.
Far-reaching changes in the structure of personal and company taxation and
in taxes on expenditure were introduced in 1973. A single graduated personal
tax replaced the old system of income tax and surtax. Company taxation was
reformed on the basis of an imputation system. A 10 per cent VAT became
operative, replacing selective employment tax and purchase tax which were
abolished. In July 1974 the rate of VAT was reduced to 8 per cent (see p. 363).
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6th April. The
rates of tax introduced in the March 1974 Budget are as follows: under the
unified system of direct personal taxation the basic rate of 33 per cent applies
to the first £4,500 of taxable income (that is, total income less deductions and
personal allowances), a rate of 38 per cent is charged on the £4,5oo-£5,ooo
band of taxable income, and the rate for successive bands rises generally in
steps of 5 per cent until a maximum rate of 83 per cent is reached at a level of
over £20,000. These rates are charged on both earned and investment in¬
comes ; larger investment incomes are also liable to a surcharge of 15 per cent
on the amount by which they exceed £2,000. The tax imposed on an individual
is graduated by means of personal allowances and reliefs. Married couples
receive higher allowances than a single person. Husband and wife may choose
to have the wife’s earnings charged separately for tax on condition that the
former receives the single personal allowance instead of the married allowance.
A single person earning £2,000 a year pays £45375 in income tax, while a
married man with the same earned income pays £374’55 5 ^ ^as two children
under the age of 11 and his earnings plus the family allowance total £2,000
his tax falls to £233-31; when the children are between the ages of 11 and 16,
the tax is £210-21; if the children are over 16 and receiving full-time educa¬
tion, £190-41. The range of tax (including the higher rates under the unified
system) payable by a single person varies from, for example, £123-75 on an
earned income of £1,000 a year to £10,768-75 on an earned income of £20,000.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in the
United Kingdom. Interest on certain United Kingdom government securities

The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many countries pro¬

unilateral relief is allowed.
Since April 1973, companies pay corporation tax at a single rate on all their
profits, whether distributed or not. However, only a proportion of any capital
gains is included in total profits, with the result that chargeable gains as a
whole are subject to a lower effective rate of tax. Income tax is no longer
deducted from dividends but a company which distributes profits to its share-

holders is required to make to the Inland Revenue an advance payment of
corporation tax. In general, this advance payment is set against a company’s
corporation tax bill and the recipient of the distribution in respect of which
the advance payment was made is entitled to a tax credit. For 1974-75, com¬
panies are required to pay a supplement (equal to half their advance corpora¬
tion tax) which is allowed against their corporation tax liability for the year.
The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget for the past
financial year; for 1973-74 it is 52 per cent with a reduced rate of 42 per cent
for small companies (as defined in the Finance Acts 1972 and 1974). The tax
is assessed on the profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate
for the financial year in which the accounting period falls.
In August 1974 the Government announced its intention to introduce later in
1974 a comprehensive tax on lifetime gifts to mesh in with the existing estate
duty, so as effectively to replace it with a comprehensive tax on all trans¬
missions of personal wealth. The tax is called Capital Transfer Tax.
At the same time the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Govern¬
ment’s intention to introduce an annual tax on wealth, but only after a
thorough public discussion about its form, rates and relationship with other
forms of taxation had taken place. The first step towards this was the publica¬
tion of a consultative document.
Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
or, in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax for persons
other than companies is 30 per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less,
depending on their circumstances. Certain assets are exempt from tax, includ¬
ing the principal private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000 (and any
chattels, except those used for the purpose of a trade, with a predictable life of
less than 50 years), private motor cars, and National Savings Certificates. The
1971 Finance Act also exempted an individual from capital gains tax where the
total proceeds of disposals do not exceed £500 in any year. All gains are now
subject to long-term capital gains tax whatever the length of period of owner¬
ship, except for gains on gilt-edged securities which continue to be exempt
from capital gains tax if held for more than 12 months.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely VAT, car tax and the duties on
tobacco, hydrocarbon oil, alcoholic drinks, protective duties, betting and
revenue duties. In British usage the distinction between customs and excise
depends on whether the goods are imported (customs duties) or produced in
Britain (excise duties). These taxes are usually referred to as indirect taxes
since they are normally paid by the importer, manufacturer, or wholesaler,
who adjusts the prices charged to customers accordingly. The Treaty of
Accession to the European Community provides that the revenue duties
should be gradually converted to internal taxes chargeable alike on imported
and home-produced goods. All the revenue duty goods (other than hydro¬
carbon oil for non-road use) are subject to the standard rate of VAT.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary between Budgets the
rate of VAT by up to 20 per cent, and the rate of any of the other main groups
of customs and excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, oil and the
minor revenue duties) by up to 10 per cent. This power, known as the
‘regulator’, requires annual renewal. The March 1974 Budget increased the duty
on tobacco, spirits, wine and beer.

Value added tax (VAT) is collected at each stage in the production and distri¬
bution process (unlike purchase tax which was collected at a single stage).
The final tax is borne by the consumer. A taxable person (generally, a trader
carrying on a business with a turnover of more than £5,000 a year) is charged
by suppliers of goods and services with VAT (‘input tax). The trader then
charges the customer with VAT on goods and services supplied (‘output’
tax). The trader pays to Customs and Excise the difference between output
and input tax. Although VAT falls on imported goods, most exports are zero¬
rated and, unlike purchase tax, VAT entering directly into export costs can be
reclaimed.
VAT, which is chargeable at the standard rate of 8 per cent, is a broadly
based tax falling on final consumers’ expenditure except where there are
strong social or economic reasons for giving relief. There are two basic
methods by which supplies of goods and services may get relief from VAT:
zero-rating, when a trader does not have to charge tax to a customer, but can
reclaim any input tax paid to suppliers, and exemption, when a trader does not
have to charge a customer any output tax but is not entitled to deduct or
reclaim any input tax included in the price of these goods or services. The most
important supplies to which zero-rating applies are most types of food (except
in the course of catering); books, newspapers and periodicals; fuel (except for
petrol and other fuels for road use); construction of buildings; exports (goods
and most services); public transport fares; young children’s clothing and foot¬
wear; and drugs and medicines supplied on prescription. Exemption applies
to land (including rents); insurance; postal services; betting, gaming and
lotteries; finance; education; health; and burial and cremation.
The first Budget in 1974 extended VAT to include confectionery, some
manufactured beverages and hydrocarbon oil for private use.
New cars, whether British made or imported, are chargeable with car tax at
10 per cent on the wholesale value. VAT falls on the price including car tax.
The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to
football pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 40 per
cent of the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged at the
rate of 7-5 per cent of stake money except for on-course betting which is
charged at 4 per cent. Gaming is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.
Taxes on motor vehicles are collected for the Department of the Environment
by local post offices; the proceeds are paid into the Consolidated Fund. The
licence duty on a private motor car is £25 a year; motor cycles and three-wheel
vehicles, etc., pay £2-50, £5 or £10 a year according to engine capacity. Goods
vehicles are taxed by unladen weight, and taxis and buses by seating capacity.
The National Debt increased rapidly during and immediately after the first and
second world wars. It rose from £650 million in 19141° j£7>435 million at the
end of the first world war, and from ^7»I3I million in 1939 to .£23,647 million
in 1946. On 31st March 1974 the total National Debt was estimated at £40,122
million, of which £1,543 million was repayable in currencies other than
sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of the
£38,51:9 million of internal debt, £6,399 million was short-term debt, mainly
in the form of 91-day Treasury bills, while the long-term loans included a
variety of stocks, bonds, loans and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest
(ranging from 2^ to 12 per cent) and with fixed or indeterminate dates of re¬
payment.

PUBLIC FINANCE
IN NORTHERN
IRELAND
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole. The
major sources of revenue are the main national taxes imposed by the United
Kingdom Parliament over the whole country. Revenue also accrues from
taxes such as rates and some licence fees. The revenue required to meet the
cost of devolved services is derived from the Northern Ireland share of the
yield of United Kingdom taxes which is paid out of the Consolidated Fund of
the United Kingdom into that of Northern Ireland, from the product of
taxes levied locally, and from certain non-tax revenue which accrues locally.
This revenue may be supplemented by an annual sum voted to the Secretary
of State. (Loans from the United Kingdom National Loans Fund will con¬
tinue to be available—up to a limit of £350 million which may be increased to
^450 million by order—to finance capital expenditure programmes in
Northern Ireland.)
Various funds have been established in Northern Ireland, in addition to
statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes. In general, these
funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal funds being those
relating to national insurance and government loans. The latter constitutes a
pool of money available mainly for local and public authority borrowings; on
31st March 1974 a sum of approximately £400 million was outstanding
against such borrowers.
THE CENTRAL BANK
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It com¬
prises a central bank; deposit banks which perform the usual main banking
services; the United Kingdom offices of banks whose main business is in other
countries; merchant banks and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and
Royal Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by
the Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank,
the Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to
deposit banks; it is the note-issuing authority and the registrar for some
200 government, nationalised industry, local authority, public board and
Commonwealth government stocks. As agent for the Government the Bank
administers exchange control. On behalf of the Treasury it manages the
Exchange Equalisation Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves
of gold, foreign exchange and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the Inter¬
national Monetary Fund. Using the resources of the EEA the Bank designs
its interventions in the foreign exchange market both to prevent undue
fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling and to conserve the means of
making payments abroad.
As banker to the Government the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and undertakes the appropriate operations
in the money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently the Bank
has a major responsibility for advising the Government on the formulation of
monetary policy and for its subsequent execution.
In implementing monetary policy the Bank is ready to act daily in the money
market, by buying or selling Treasury and other bills, and similarly in the
market for government stocks. When necessary, the Bank may exert influence
on interest rates through market operations; an important indication of its
intentions is the minimum lending rate (known as ‘Bank rate’ until 1972),
which is the minimum rate at which the Bank will normally lend to the

members of the London Discount Market and is normally i per cent above the
average rate of discount for Treasury bills. The Bank can also influence market
and money supply conditions through its power to call for special deposits.
The Bank is the recognised channel of communication between the deposit
banks and other financial institutions of the City of London on the one hand,
and the Government on the other.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish clearing and
Northern Ireland banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart
from an amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered
by Bank of England notes. The provision of coin for circulation is the respon¬
sibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
Following discussions by the Bank of England with the banks, the hire pur¬
chase finance houses and the discount houses, new arrangements for the
control of credit came into effect from September 1971. While it is still neces¬
sary for the Government, as an indispensable part of economic management, to
regulate the development of credit and the money supply, the new system has
replaced rigid quantitative controls over lending in sterling with policies for
influencing bank and finance house lending which are designed to combine
effective control with greater flexibility and freedom for these institutions. The
techniques now in operation involve more reliance upon changes in interest
rates, in particular through calls by the Bank for special deposits from other
banks superimposed on a minimum reserve assets ratio of 12^ per cent of
eligible liabilities.1 Calls for special deposits also restrict the growth of money
supply by reducing the banks’ lending base. The ceiling controls on lending
by the banks and finance houses have been removed and the London and
Scottish clearing banks have abandoned their collective agreements on interest
rates. Moreover they now set their base rates for lending independently of the
minimum lending rate, which closely reflects short term market rates. Greater
potential for competition and innovation by these institutions has thereby been
introduced into the domestic economy.
In December 1973, the Bank introduced a supplementary scheme to im¬
prove its control over the money supply and bank lending. The scheme
came into effect during 1974 and was designed to penalise any growth in the
banks’ interest-bearing deposits above a specified rate through the placing
of non-interest bearing supplementary special deposits at the Bank of England.
THE PRIVATE SECTOR
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and encash¬
ment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London clearing
banks, three Scottish clearing banks and two Northern Ireland banks. Mergers
have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in London
and two in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by London
clearing banks, but two groups of banks based in the Irish Republic also
operate in Northern Ireland.
In December 1973 current and deposit accounts with deposit banks operat¬
ing in Britain totalled some £23,081 million, and accounted for nearly 32 per
cent of the total deposits (in sterling and foreign currencies) of the banking
sector, which also includes the National Giro, the accepting houses, overseas
1 Basically sterling deposits of two years or less from outside the banking system together
with any foreign currency changed into sterling.

banks, other banks and the discount market. The deposit banks provide full
banking services throughout Britain, and operate through over 14,000 branches.
Several of them have interests in British overseas and Commonwealth banks,
and in other banks which have been formed specially to compete in inter¬
national markets. They have also acquired substantial interests in hire-
purchase finance houses, and some have set up their own unit trusts.
Together with the Bank of England the London clearing banks, the Trustee
Savings Banks and the Co-operative bank make up the membership of the
London Bankers’ Clearing House. In 1973 cheques, drafts, bills and bankers’
effects passing through the interbank debit clearing system averaged in value
nearly £121,440 million monthly, while the average monthly value of the
credit transfer clearing was over £1,355 million.
Current account balances with the deposit banks are repayable on demand
and no interest is paid on them, but on deposit account balances interest is
paid at a rate below individual banks’ base rates. All banks have been asked
by the Bank of England to place a ceiling of 9^ per cent on the rate of interest
paid on deposits under £10,000. The deposit banks’ more liquid assets
consist of: cash, balances at the Bank of England, money at call (mainly loans
to discount houses), and their holdings of Treasury and commercial bills. The
banks also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio (mainly British
Government securities) or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or with¬
out collateral security). The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total
deposits in February 1974 was 64 per cent.
The bank giro, originally introduced as the credit transfer scheme, and the
direct debiting system, by which a creditor with the prior approval of the
debtor may claim money due to him direct from the latter’s banking account,
have helped to improve the money transmission services. Another banking
innovation has been the introduction by some banks of automatic cash
dispensing machines. Credit cards are in widespread use for the settlement of
accounts in retail shops; and cheque cards enable the card holder to cash a
cheque up to £30 at any office of the major British and Irish banks, and at
offices of many banks in overseas countries.
The Post Office National Giro, which was introduced in 1968 to provide a
low-cost current account banking and money transfer service, is operated
through most post offices in Britain. All accounts and transactions are main¬
tained by means of a computer complex at the National Giro Centre near
Liverpool. On its fourth anniversary in March 1973, Giro had 473,000
accounts with deposits of nearly £81 million. The number of weekly trans¬
actions had risen from 500,000 in September 1969 to 3*3 million by March
1974 when the weekly turnover was £300 million. In addition to its services
to individuals Giro’s services to commerce, industry and the public utilities
include a facility whereby organisations with dispersed branches, depots and
representatives can rapidly channel receipts into their central accounting
system. Many local authorities use Giro’s rent collection services. Giro’s
international services also provide money transfer facilities in Europe linking
over 16 million account holders in the European Community and other
countries in Western Europe.
There are also 43 British overseas and Commonwealth banks, many of which
have their headquarters in London. They provide a comprehensive banking

service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of trade not
only between Britain and other countries but also between third countries.
There are also in London 44 United States banks, 36 European banks in¬
cluding 19 from the European Community, 16 Japanese banks, about 47 other
foreign banks and 32 consortium banks.
The merchant banks have an influence on Britain’s financial affairs which is
much greater than their size in relation to other financial institutions might
suggest. Traditionally merchant banks have been primarily concerned with
acceptance credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activi¬
ties with an important role in: international finance and the short-term capital
markets; the provision of expert advice and financial services to British
industrial companies especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of
corporate reorganisation are involved; and the management of investment
holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds.
The Money or Discount Market is an institution which is unique to the City of
London. Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mecha¬
nism designed to promote an orderly flow of short-term funds. The market
consists of 11 discount houses which borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice and
lend for somewhat longer periods. They have recourse to the Bank of England
as lender of last resort and the Bank lends to the houses generally overnight or
for seven days at minimum lending rate, although it may charge a higher rate.
Most of the market’s borrowed funds come from the banks, which are thus
provided with a flexible means of earning a yield on surplus funds which they
have at any given time.
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commer¬
cial bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates
of deposit denominated in both sterling and US dollars. The market accepts as
an informal responsibility that it should cover the Government’s need to
borrow on Treasury bills which are offered on tender each week.
The National Savings Movement started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings. The present movement encourages the widespread invest¬
ment of savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the National Savings Bank
(see p. 368) and in National Savings securities. The movement is led by the
National Savings Committee for England and Wales and similar committees
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The committees consist of representatives
of the voluntary savings movement in the regions and of various national
institutions connected with finance, industry and education. They have a
staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often supported
by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups.
Northern Ireland issues separately Ulster Savings Certificates and Ulster
Development Bonds on the same terms as the corresponding National Savings
Certificates described below.
The administration of the National Savings Bank and other forms of national
savings is carried out by the Department for National Savings. Five forms
1 Acceptance credits are usually short-term (90 days) arrangements to finance exports
from, and imports to, Britain and other markets. The expression is derived from the
method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’ or guaranteed by a
merchant bank against documents, after which they may be discounted for cash by a
discount house.

10,000. Premium Savings Bonds are in units of £1 (minimum purchase is
£2) and individual holdings are limited to £2,000. After a qualifying period of
three months the bonds give investors a chance to win tax-free prizes instead of
receiving interest. There is now a weekly draw for a prize of £50,000, and 25
prizes of £1,000 and a monthly draw for prizes ranging from £25 to £75,000.
At the end of April 1974, £1,022 million was invested in this form of savings. A
selection of British Government securities is held on the National Savings
Stock Register. Trustee Savings Banks also deal in stock on the National
Savings Stock Register.
In August 1974 the Government announced that it would introduce two
new savings schemes to protect small savers from inflation. The first, designed
for men aged 65 (women aged 60) and over, is a savings bond to be introduced
in 1975. The second scheme will be available to all those eligible for the
current Save-As-You-Earn scheme (see below), which it will replace. Both
schemes will be adjusted periodically in accordance with the price index.
A contractual savings scheme, known as ‘Save as You Earn’ (SAYE), enables
savings to be made in regular monthly amounts with a minimum of £ 1 and a
maximum of £20 in deposits with the Department for National Savings or
Trustee Savings Banks by means of deductions from pay or by other regular
payments. Under the terms of the Second Issue (introduced in July 1974) at
the end of five years, savings will qualify for a bonus equivalent to 14 months’
savings tax free. Completed savings which are not withdrawn will qualify for a
double bonus at the end of seven years, that is, 28 months’ savings. For
example, contributions totalling £60 payable over five years at a rate of £1 per
month will qualify for a bonus of £14 at the end of that period, or £28 if left
on deposit for a further two years. Savers who wish to stop payments will be
able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there cannot be partial withdrawals).
Tax-free compound interest will be paid at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on
amounts withdrawn after the first but before the end of the fifth year or where
the contributions cease but the savings are left invested for the remainder of
the five years, or 8 per cent where the saver dies before the contributions are
completed. Proposals for a new contractual scheme are mentioned above.
The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings and has over 22 million active accounts. Ordinary
Accounts bear interest at 4 per cent and the first £40 of interest is tax free (a
new tax exemption limit introduced for the 1974-75 year of assessment). Up
to £20 can be withdrawn on demand at any savings bank post office, but a few
days’ notice is required for larger amounts. The money is lodged with the
National Debt Commissioners and is invested in government securities.
Deposits bearing a higher rate of interest (at present 9 per cent) may be made
in Investment Accounts. All deposits carry a government guarantee. At the end
of April 1974 the sum of the two accounts totalled £2,080 million.

The Trustee Savings Banks, most of which were founded in the nineteenth
century, operate under their own trustees but are subject to Government
supervision through the National Debt Office and the Trustee Savings Banks
Inspection Committee. There are 72 individual banks with over 1,550 offices
and 11 million depositors. Deposits can be made either in the Ordinary
Department, the Special Investment Department or the Current Account
Department. Savings in the Ordinary Department earn interest at 4 per cent
and the first £40 of interest is tax free. Withdrawals can usually be made on
demand though notice is required for large sums. Deposits are invested with
the National Debt Commissioners and both capital and interest are guaranteed
by the Government. The Special Investment Department offers a higher rate
of return, which is taxable.
At the end of April 1974 total sums in Ordinary Departments of the Trustee
Savings Banks were £1,389 million and in the Special Investment Depart¬
ments £1,995 million. Most Trustee Savings Banks operate cheque services on
deposits in the Current Account Departments, and other services include the
purchase of government securities and the SAYE (see p. 368) contractual
savings scheme. The Trustee Savings Banks operate their own unit trust and
units may be purchased by depositors and non-depositors alike.
In August 1974, the Government announced that the role of Trustee
Savings Banks would be expanded and would include personal loans to
depositors. At the end of April 1974 National Savings totalled £10,472
million.
Many special financial facilities, which are supplementary to the credit
facilities of the banks, are provided through institutions outside the banking
system. These include: finance corporations, hire-purchase finance com¬
panies, the stock exchange, investment trust companies, unit trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are in
the main highly specialised, for example, discount and other finance houses,
stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.
There are about 1,900 firms engaged in the financing of hire-purchase and
other instalment credit transactions, and of these 35 constitute the Finance
Houses Association and together cover 90 per cent of all finance house busi¬
ness. At the end of 1973 the value of instalment credit debt outstanding to
finance houses and retailers amounted to £2,485 million, compared with
about £975 million at the end of i960. About 65 per cent of the assets of finance
houses consists of hire-purchase agreements and other instalment credit. Of
this amount between 60 and 70 per cent relates to cars and commercial
vehicles, the remainder relating to industrial and building equipment and
household and other goods.
Since 1965 the leading finance houses have observed the authorities’ policies
on lending similar to those applied to banks, and all finance houses have been
required to observe term controls affecting the minimum deposit and maxi¬
mum repayment period for specific goods financed by certain forms of lend¬
ing. The system of credit control introduced in 1971 (see p. 365) has been
applied to the larger finance houses, whose total eligible liabilities exceed £5
million.
Finance for Industry Ltd. was formed in 1973 as a result of the merger of the
Finance Corporation for Industry and the Industrial and Commercial Finance

Corporation. It provides capital for the re-equipment and development of
industry when finance cannot readily be obtained elsewhere; and provides
capital, financial advice, computer bureaux, and other services to small and
medium-sized companies, especially those concerned in technical development.
Authorised capital amounts to about £100 million and the group may borrow
up to four times its capital and reserves to bring actual and potential resources
to almost £500 million.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (CDFC) is no longer
confined to the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise
overseas by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on
mutually acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which
about 14^ million ‘A’ ordinary shares of (^o-io paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in Britain, and nf million ‘B’ ordinary
shares of (£0-50 paid) are held by the Bank of England and certain central
banks in the Commonwealth. At 31st March 1974 the CDFC held investments
worth £33 million spread over a wide range of industries placed in more than
39 countries.
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was established in 1928 for the
purpose of making loans to farmers. Its authorised share capital is *5 million
and at 31st March 1974, loans and investments amounted to £244 million.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) was set up in 1948
and undertakes projects for the promotion and expansion of a wide range of
enterprises within and outside of the Commonwealth. At the end of 1973,
CDC had a total capital commitment of ^243 million.
The stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and Irish Republic amalgamated
on 25th March 1973. Dealings with the public remain unchanged, but brokers
may open offices nationally and firms wherever situated trade on equal terms.
The main exchange and central administration are in London. There are also
exchanges in Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,
Dublin and Belfast.
The number and variety of securities officially listed on the London exchange
is greater than in any other market and its turnover of company securities is
roughly equivalent to that of all the European bourses combined. Some 10,000
securities are quoted on the London exchange; at the end of March 1974 these
had a total market value of £176,898 million. About 7,770 securities of
companies are quoted, including a number of leading overseas companies.
Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the securities at market
valuation, the remainder being United Kingdom and overseas government
and corporation stocks.
The stock exchange does not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains
are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand for
the securities concerned. The stock exchange operates under strict rules of
conduct which it formulates itself.
There has been substantial growth in demand for ordinary (equity) shares,
partly in expectation that such shares will maintain or increase their real value.
This demand, however, is very sensitive to the state of the economy, and
economic uncertainty in 1973-74 caused large falls in share values. There is a
growing level of institutional investment on the London market by insurance
companies, pension funds, and by investment and unit trusts. The percentage
of total market holdings of ordinary shares quoted in Britain held by these
four groups of institutions together rose from 25 per cent to 31 per cent over
the six-year period March 1964-70.

Investment trust companies and unit trusts enable investors to spread their
risks and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The usual type of investment trust company is constituted as a public com¬
pany registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business
is to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it
may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to
build up reserves. Investment trust companies grew to importance in the latter
half of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment. At the end of 1973 investment trust companies
held assets worth £5,600 million, of which over one-third were in overseas
securities.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell
units to the public and must invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of stock
exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly by an
initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a semi¬
annual service charge which is usually taken out of the income of the trust.
The level of both charges is controlled by the Department of Trade, whose
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is only
granted if the trust deed is satisfactory to them.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving has
grown considerably since 1957* ^ en<^ March 1974 there were 2-2
million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised trusts rose
from £60 million in 1958 to £1,909 million at the end of March 1974; it has
nearly trebled since the end of There is now a wide variety of trusts,
both as regards the range of investments covered and the ways in which they
cater for the differing needs of investors.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by friendly societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of mutual or
joint stock insurance companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
There are about 625 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom.
Most British insurers write several classes of business although some specialise
in one class, particularly in life assurance, where about 150 companies write
only that type of business. A few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition about 170 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, which illustrates the
international nature of the London market. Some of the large British com¬
panies, however, have their administrative headquarters in the provinces.
At the end of 1972 the total assets of the British insurance companies
amounted to about £22,360 million, the bulk of which is life assurance
companies’ investments.
The Government’s supervisory powers over insurance companies under the
Insurance Companies Acts 1958-73 are exercised by the Department of
Trade.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private insurers in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd’s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and intelligence of shipping movements. Although in its earlier history the

activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance business,
there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market
for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine,
aviation and motor markets.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871:
the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are administered
by the Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact insurance business.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and in
competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd’s
brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the insured.
Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact insurance
with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent financial regula¬
tions laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give security to the Lloyd’s
policy which is second to none. Since 1969 non-Commonwealth underwriters
have been admitted to membership of Lloyd’s, if they satisfy the requirements.
Today there are about 7,600 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped
into some 260 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents
who accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
In conjunction with its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelli¬
gence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a
valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London representa¬
tives of the latter.
About two-thirds of general (that is, non-life) insurance business is carried
on overseas, partly by re-insurance on the London market and partly through
branches and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic principle
of this international business is that resources capable of meeting any potential
loss are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other re¬
sources of Lloyd’s underwriters.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome insurance and re-insurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the govern¬
ments of member states. The purpose of the directives is to harmonise the
legislation of the various member countries, thus providing a ‘common
market’, which would avoid distortion of competition. Two directives have
been approved by the Council of Ministers. The first deals with the conditions
of access to non-life insurance business and the second requires member
countries not to discriminate in law or practice between their own subjects
and those of other member states. Draft directives on life insurance, insurance
contracts, and the taxation of insurance policies are also being considered.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner-occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and industrial
FINANCE
373
premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly from
the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of share
capital is not fixed; shares which have a fixed value are not dealt in on the stock
exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given. The Building
Societies Act 1962, which consolidated a number of earlier Acts, prescribes the
general way in which societies must conduct their business. The Chief
Registrar of Friendly Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either
advertising or accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in
which the society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money.
The rapid expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has
been accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a
few large societies. At the end of 1973, 456 societies were in operation, with
total assets of about ^17,000 million; half of this amount is accounted for by
the five largest societies. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1973 was
nearly £3,500 million, six per cent less than in 1972.

OVERSEAS TRADE
Although small in area and accounting for only about 1*5 per cent of the
world’s population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and,
as a member of the European Community, part of the world’s biggest trading
area which accounts for about 40 per cent of all trade.
For well over a century international trade has been of vital importance to
the country’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for about half its total con¬
sumption of foodstuffs and most of the raw materials needed for its industries.
It is among the world’s largest importers of foodstuffs, metals and ores, textile
raw materials, petroleum and many other products. Its exports of goods
represent about one-fifth of the gross national product. It is a major supplier
of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures, electrical apparatus,
chemicals and textiles.
Changes in the value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
In 1973 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £11,435 mifikm f.o.b.
on a balance of payments basis. On the same basis, after excluding payment
for freight and insurance and making some other adjustments, Britain’s
imports in 1973 were about ^13,810 million. Between 1972 and 1973 t^ie va^ue
of exports rose by 25 per cent while that of imports increased by 41 per cent.
Over the same period the volume index of exports rose by 12 per cent, and of
imports by 13 per cent; but the unit value of exports rose by only 13 per cent
while import unit values rose by 27 per cent, largely because of higher com¬
modity prices and the depreciation of sterling (see p. 194).
Exports had increased steadily from 1961 to 1966, but in 1967 they declined
slightly in value as well as in volume. Following the devaluation of sterling in
1967 they rose rapidly until 1972 when they increased by only 4 per cent in
value compared with n per cent in 1971. 1973 saw a marked recovery with
the value of exports growing by 25 per cent, around half of which represented
an increase in volume; a rate about twice that of the annual average volume
increase of the previous five years. This sharp increase was generated in part
by the upswing in world trade in manufactures in 1973 and in part by the
initial effects of the depreciation of sterling since mid-1972 on the competitive¬
ness of British goods overseas. The rapid rise in exports continued in early
I974-
There was a particularly rapid expansion of imports in 1964 (15 per cent in
value and 11 per cent in volume) and again in 1968 (22 per cent in value and
10 per cent in volume). The increase in the value of imports in 1973 mainly
reflected the effects of increased commodity prices, which, together with the
depreciation of sterling, accounted for about two-thirds of the rise in value
of imports. The further large increase in value in early 1974 can be mainly

attributed to the sharp rise in oil prices. The increased demand for imports
associated with the growth of domestic output in 1973 also contributed to the
rise in the import bill.
From 1964 to 1967 there had been a steady improvement in Britain’s terms
of trade, that is, export prices rose faster than import prices. Following the
devaluation of the pound in November 1967 the terms of trade index fell by
4 per cent in 1968, but subsequently continued to increase until 1972, when it
stood at 101-7 (1970=100). With the sharp rise in commodity prices and the
lower exchange value of sterling, the index fell to 90-3 in 1973 and by the end
of the first half of 1974 to 75-2.
The value and volume of exports and imports from 1968 to 1973 are shown
in Table 31.
The value of Britain’s imported food supplies has been growing less rapidly
than the value of total imports and the ratio of imported foodstuffs to total
imports has fallen from 39 per cent in 1954 to less than 20 per cent in 1973.
There has been a similar downward trend in the proportion accounted for by
basic materials—from 30 per cent in 1954 to over 12 per cent in 1973 though
this showed a slight increase over the 1972 proportion.
Imports of petroleum and petroleum products are by far the biggest single
item by value, amounting to io-6 per cent of the total value of imports during
1973 when their value was £1,682 million. With the large increases in the
price of oil the proportion by value is expected to increase considerably.
The most marked change in recent years has been the rise, in Britain as in

Exports

other industrial countries, in the proportion of imports of finished manufac¬
tures, particularly capital goods and industrial components. Such imports
rose from about 6 per cent of total imports in 1957 to 29 per cent in 1973,
amounting to ^4,633 million in value. Imports of semi-manufactures have also
been increasing steadily and since 1962 have formed a larger part of the total
import bill than basic materials, partly because the countries producing the
basic materials increasingly participate in the subsequent stages of manu¬
facture themselves. Imports of semi-manufactured goods (including chemicals)
totalled £4,280 million in 1973 and accounted for 27 per cent of total imports.
About 84 per cent of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods both
finished and semi-manufactured. By far the most important group is engineer¬
ing products—in 1973 41 per cent of total exports compared with 44 per cent
in 1972. Within this group, exports of many types of machinery, electrical
equipment, road vehicles, agricultural machinery and scientific instruments
have been increasing rapidly though the share in total exports of transport
equipment in particular has fallen. The share of chemicals has grown fairly
steadily, exports of chemicals having grown by 32 per cent in 1973. The share
of metals was little changed in 1973 following a steady fall over a number of
years to 10*4 per cent in 1972.
For the first time in many years textiles’ share rose marginally in 1973 to 4*7
per cent having fallen from 18 per cent of the total in 1948 to 4*6 per cent in

1972. The proportion accounted for by food, beverages and tobacco rose to 7
per cent in 1973.
Composition of exports and imports in 1967 and 1973 is shown in Table 32.
Trade between Britain and Western Europe has been increasing in recent
years—particularly rapidly in 1973—and conversely there has been a decline
in the proportion of Britain’s exports going to primary producing countries.
In 1958, 31 per cent of exports went to Western Europe, but in 1962 these
exports began to exceed those to the sterling area and in 1973 they formed just
over half of the total, having risen by 34 per cent during the year; they rose
sharply again in early 1974 to nearly 52 per cent of the total. Exports to the
enlarged European Economic Community (EEC) rose by 37 per cent to account
for over 32 per cent of Britain’s total exports; and in early 1974 they rose
further to over 33 per cent of the total. Exports to the European Free Trade
Area (EFTA) countries increased by 30 per cent in 1973.
Imports from Western Europe rose by 48 per cent in 1973, forming one
half of the total imports but fell during early 1974 to 48 per cent of the total.
Imports from the European Community also rose by 48 per cent in 1973 to
form one-third of all imports.
In relative terms Britain’s trade with other members of the Commonwealth
and with the sterling area as a whole has tended to decline in recent years.
Exports to the sterling area (see p. 385) amounted to 18 per cent of total
exports in 1973 compared with 29 per cent in 1962. Imports have shown a
similar fall in their share of the total. Canada, Australia, South Africa and the
Irish Republic are still among Britain’s leading trading partners but since 1957
the United States has been Britain’s largest single market and source of
imports. In 1973 North America accounted for about 15 per cent of Britain’s
exports and imports. The value of exports to Latin America increased by 5 per
cent in 1973 but the value of imports rose by 47 per cent. After a fall in 1971
Britain’s trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe resumed in 1972 the
growth apparent since i960, and in 1973 exports rose by 17 per cent and im¬
ports by 42 per cent. Trade with Japan continued to grow; exports rose
sharply by 59 per cent in 1973 while imports maintained a high rate of growth,
with a 41 per cent increase. (See also Table 33.)
As far back as estimates have been made, that is, for nearly two centuries,
Britain has usually earned a surplus from its invisible transactions: the receipts

and payments arising from services (as distinct from goods) supplied to and
received from overseas residents; the income arising from outward and in¬
ward investment; and transfers between Britain and other countries.
The invisible transactions involved are divided for statistical purposes into
six main groups: government services and transfers; transport (shipping and
civil aviation); travel; other services (which covers a variety of items including
the financial services of the City of London); interest, profits and dividends;
and private transfers (migrants’ funds, legacies and private gifts). Table 34
shows the breakdown of the figures from 1967 to 1973- The total invisible
balance in 1973 was £ 1,165 millkm- Gross earnings of i/7,969 million from total
invisible exports were about two-thirds of the total of j£i 1,435 milli°n from
visible exports. Net private invisible receipts were £2,150 million.
As shown in Table 34, in recent years there has been a considerable and
rapidly rising net surplus on ‘other services’ and another large surplus on
interest, profits and dividends. There has also been a surplus on civil aviation
services throughout the past decade. Sea transport transactions have been in
deficit since 1969. Travel credits have exceeded debits since 1968. About half
the total debits in respect of government expenditure relates to military
expenditure overseas and this has remained steady or fallen in real terms in
recent years, though currency changes have caused the sterling value to rise;
other substantial items of expenditure are grants to developing countries,
expenditure on the diplomatic service, subscriptions to international organisa¬
tions, and Britain’s contribution to the common budget for the financing of
European Community expenditure (see p. 79).

In addition Britain is paying £24 million in three annual instalments into the
European Coal and Steel Community, a capital subscription of £37-5 million
in five instalments ending in 1975 to the European Investment Bank and a
contribution of £20 million to the Bank’s reserves over the same period.
Tourism yields a substantial income from overseas; in the ten years 1964-73
overseas visitors spent nearly ^3,630 million in Britain. For 1973 these travel
and tourist receipts, excluding fares, are estimated at about £680 million.
United Kingdom residents on holiday, or travelling for business or other
purposes overseas, spent about £674 million (excluding fares) in the same
year. The continuing increase in both the average expenditure per visitor and
in the number of travellers visiting Britain has produced the surpluses on
travel credits mentioned above since 1968. The estimated total number of
visits to the United Kingdom in 1973, including visitors from the Irish
Republic, was a record figure of 7-6 million—more than twice the level of 1956
and an increase of 6 per cent over the 1972 level.
Britain’s national tourist organisation consists of four independent govern¬
ment-financed statutory bodies—the British Tourist Authority, which is
responsible for the overseas promotion of tourism in Britain and for certain
general matters affecting the country as a whole, and the English, Scottish
and Wales Tourist Boards which are responsible for encouraging the develop¬
ment and improvement of facilities and amenities for tourists in their respec¬
tive countries, and for tourist promotional work and publicity within Britain
—and a separate statutory Tourist Board for Northern Ireland. The English,
Scottish and Wales boards offer financial assistance to selected tourist projects
in development areas.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain has long been an advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade,
and to this end has taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations
as the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop¬
ment, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD). As a member of the European Community, Britain is com¬
mitted to working for the development of world trade by the progressive
reduction through reciprocal measures of both tariff and non-tariff barriers.
Britain’s protective tariffs have been considerably modified in recent years
as a result of negotiations held under the auspices of GATT which also seek to
increase the volume of world trade by reducing tariffs and other barriers to
trade, and by eliminating discrimination in international commerce.
As a result of the ‘Kennedy Round’ (May 1964-June 1967), a series of
GATT tariff negotiations, average reductions of over 30 per cent were made
by the major trading countries in their tariffs on industrial goods. The reduc¬
tions made between 1968 and 1972 in the British tariffs on dutiable industrial
goods imported from the EEC, the United States and Japan amounted to
about 37 per cent, 40 per cent and 34 per cent respectively. This was closely
in line with the reductions made by these countries which affected well over
70 per cent of British exports of dutiable industrial goods to them. Some reduc¬
tions were also made in the tariff on agricultural goods. A new series of negoti¬
ations began in September 1973.
All tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the other Com¬
munity countries are being eliminated in five equal stages over the transitional
period ending 1st July 1977. By the same date Britain will be applying the
common customs tariff to all countries neither belonging to, nor having any
special arrangement with, the Community, subject to special arrangements for
some industrial materials. By the same date also virtually all industrial tariff
barriers between the European Community and the remaining member
countries of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA), to which Britain belonged
between i960 and 1972, will have been dismantled.
Reciprocal preferential tariff treatment for trade between Britain and other
independent Commonwealth countries dates from the Ottawa Conference of
1932. Following Britain’s accession to the European Community, 21 in¬
dependent developing Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean, the
Indian Ocean and the Pacific1 took part in negotiations covering both trade
and aid arrangements for a new convention of Association with the Community.
This is due to come into effect in 1975. All Britain’s dependent territories
(except Gibraltar and Hong Kong, to which special conditions apply) have
been offered association under the Treaty of Rome. At Malta’s request it is
not being included in the Community’s generalised preference scheme (see
p. 381). Special arrangements have been made to protect the sugar exports of
the Commonwealth and the dairy products trade of New Zealand. The
Community has stated its continuing objective of expanding and reinforcing
existing trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia, taking into
1 Barbados, Botswana, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Kenya,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius (with whom an association agreement was negotiated in
1972), Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Tonga,
Uganda, Western Samoa and Zambia. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were already
associated with the Community of Six under the Arusha Convention.

account the scope of the generalised preference scheme from which they are
expected to derive considerable benefit. Another important development in
this respect was the signing in December 1973 of a commercial co-operation
agreement between the Community and India.
The establishment of a system of generalised preference for manufactures and
semi-manufactures exported by developing countries was agreed in principle
at the second UNCTAD Conference in New Delhi in 1968. Britain’s scheme
started early in 1972, but, as a member of the European Community, Britain
adopted in 1974 the Community’s scheme, which first came into effect in July
1971, but was considerably improved after the Community’s enlargement.
Over 100 countries benefit from the scheme which provides for tariff reduc¬
tions on manufactured or semi-manufactured products and a large number of
processed agricultural products.
There are now very few restrictions imposed by Britain on the movement of
goods and services.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade is empowered to prohibit or regulate the import or
export of goods. Several other departments have separate powers to control
imports and exports for specific purposes.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, and fits European Community Membership, Britain has progressively
removed quantitative restrictions from almost all its imports from non¬
communist countries. There has also been a continuing substantial relaxation
of quantitative controls on imports from communist countries. Controls
remain on a few goods including (those recognised internationally) arms,
ammunition and radioactive materials. Controlled goods require a specific
import licence and quotas have been set up for many of them. Apart from
economic controls, some further restrictions or prohibitions are applied under
separate legislation for the protection of health or public safety, in the interest
of conservation, and for other non-economic reasons (for example, on animals,
drugs and explosives). There is also a general import restriction on goods from
Rhodesia as part of the Government’s sanctions policy against the illegal
regime.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the scheduled territories1 are paid for in the proper manner most British
exports are not subject to any government control or direction. The few
controls that are in operation are imposed to supervise exports of military
and strategic importance; to conserve materials which may be in short supply;
on diamonds to assist exchange control operations (see below) in preventing the
export of capital in that form; to ensure the humane treatment of cattle, sheep
and pigs; and to prevent the export of antiques (including works of art and
documents), and documentary and photographic material over 70 years old,
on grounds of national importance. There is a general export restriction on
goods to Rhodesia.
Britain applies exchange control mainly in order to conserve its reserves of
gold and foreign exchange. The powers under the Exchange Control Act 1947
1 In September 1974 the scheduled territories comprised the United Kingdom, the
Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Irish Republic and Gibraltar.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are conferred mainly on the Treasury which has delegated the administration
of most parts of the Act to the Bank of England. The Bank has in turn
authorised most commercial banks in Britain to execute a wide range of
transactions.
The general effect of exchange control regulations is to control transactions
between residents of the scheduled territories and non-residents. Payments
in sterling may in general be made freely between residents, but the acquisition
of other currencies by them is subject to control.
Exchange control policy is not to discourage investment abroad but to
regulate the manner in which investment outside the scheduled territories is
financed. Official exchange is usually available only for projects which pro¬
mise early and continuing benefits to the balance of payments. Where the use
of official exchange is not permitted investors can finance their projects in
other ways, for example, by borrowing foreign currency. Exports of goods to
destinations outside the scheduled territories have, in general, to be paid for
within six months in foreign currency or in sterling from an external account
unless they are covered by an approved export credit arrangement. Control is
also exercised over imports to ensure that currency authorised for their pay¬
ment is used for that purpose.
There are certain restrictions on dealings in gold bullion and on the use of
gold for manufacturing and industrial purposes. The buying, selling and
holding of gold coins does not require specific Exchange Control permission,
although their export remains controlled.
Residents are entitled to purchase up to £300 in foreign currency for their
travel expenditure on each journey outside the scheduled territories, other
than to Rhodesia, irrespective of the purpose of the journey. Further travel
funds may be obtained for business, professional or other reasons. Non¬
residents may hold an external account in a British bank and are entitled to
change their sterling on external account for other currencies and to make and
receive payments in any currency to and from non-residents in any other part
of the world. Special restrictions apply to transactions with residents of
Rhodesia.
People living outside the scheduled territories who visit Britain temporarily
are regarded as non-resident and not subject to the exchange control provi¬
sions. On the other hand, people coming to Britain from outside the scheduled
territories and intending to take up permanent residence in Britain would
normally be regarded as resident, though they might be eligible for certain
exemptions from their obligations under the Exchange Control Act 1947.
Visitors to Britain may import notes in any currency, travellers’ cheques and
letters of credit without limit. On departure, visitors may take with them
sterling or scheduled territory notes up to a value of £25, foreign currency
notes up to a value of £300 and any foreign currency notes which they brought
in with them.
GOVERNMENT
ASSISTANCE
TO OVERSEAS
TRADE
The Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions favourable
to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and inform¬
ation and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries. Export pro¬
motion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry),
the Development Corporation for Wales and in Northern Ireland by the
Department of Commerce.

trade fairs and other promotional activity overseas, the schemes for financial
support for firms to participate in missions overseas and for inward commercial
visits to Britain. It consists of businessmen and Department of Trade and
Foreign and Commonwealth Office representatives and operates under the
general authority of the Secretary of State for Trade who is the President.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult Department of Trade
offices throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of
the British Diplomatic Service overseas. There are over 200 posts located in
all the principal cities and trade centres overseas and they supply the British
Overseas Trade Board with information of every kind affecting trade with
their territories.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial condi¬
tions, pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities, and
generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters in trade
with the country in question, particularly those arising out of governmental
regulations. These officers investigate potential markets for British products,
advise about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out and pass
on opportunities for export business and inquiries for British goods. Assist¬
ance is also given to British exporters in appointing agents and locating
potential importers. From records kept up to date in London by reports from
its overseas commercial officers, the Export Services and Promotions Division
of the British Overseas Trade Board can provide information concerning any
country on the prospects for exports and requirements of particular markets,
government regulations affecting trade (including import restrictions and
tariffs and duties on particular commodities), methods of trading, local tastes
and preferences in design, and the commercial standing of firms with which
an exporter contemplates business relations.
The Government’s official information services overseas are used exten¬
sively to promote Britain’s export trade.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) provides credit insur¬
ance for more than a third of the country’s export trade and for much of the
external trade of British merchants.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer,
governmental action which stops the British exporter receiving payment, new
import restrictions in the buyer’s country, war, or civil disturbance in the
buyer’s country. Cover may commence from the date of contract or (at lower
premiums) from the date of shipment.
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of re¬
payment given direct to banks financing the exporter. Alternatively, for
contracts over £250,000, the ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas
buyers enabling them to pay on cash terms, or ‘lines of credit similarly
covering an agreed buying programme of an overseas country, with the mini¬
mum value of the individual contracts often as low as £10,000. The banks
provide finance against these guarantees, the bulk of this being in turn re¬
financed by the ECGD.
A new form of ECGD cover was introduced in 1972 to provide insurance
against certain political risks on overseas investment. The scheme is designed
to encourage new private investment in developing countries and offers protec¬
tion for British investors against expropriation or nationalisation, war damage
and currency inconvertibility.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs and British products are shown
at most of the large international trade fairs throughout the world.
Participation in trade fairs, ‘British weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information,
financial assistance and, in certain cases, free facilities. In 1973 the British
Overseas Trade Board assisted over 6,520 British firms at 322 trade fairs and
exhibitions in 48 countries and 155 outward trade missions; and gave practical
help to 8 ‘British Shopping Weeks’, and some 71 overseas store promotions.
In September 1973 a British Export Marketing Centre was opened in Tokyo
to hold 10 major exhibitions a year and to provide marketing facilities for
individual British firms or organisations. The Government allocated for these
purposes about £12 million in 1973-74.
In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, commerce
and shipping was accompanied by Britain’s development as an international
trading centre. A sound commercial banking system and a wide range of
financial institutions has been established to meet commercial needs for both
short- and long-term finance. The facilities provided by merchant banks and
accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance shipments of
goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas countries.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in these markets
relate to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The
need for close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance
services often determined the location of these markets in the City of London.
Among the more important are the Baltic Exchange (shipping and aircraft
charter markets), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra,
rubber and sugar), and the London Metal Exchange. In addition to these
formal markets, there is scarcely any product which cannot be traded through
an intermediary in Britain.
The market consists of about 250 authorised banks and several firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides
those engaged in international trade with foreign currencies for their trans¬
actions. The foreign exchange banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and
future delivery. An important function of the market is to engage in arbitrage
transactions which serve to eliminate differentials in exchange rates between
different centres. The forward market enables traders, who at a given date in
the future are due to receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to
determine in advance the precise sterling equivalent of the foreign currency.
All authorised banks may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely
concentrated in the hands of the five members of the London gold market.
The five members meet twice daily to fix a price for all transactions which
customers ask to have executed at the fixing. In 1968 monetary authorities
established a two-tier gold system, whereby their transactions were conducted
at the official gold price, leaving a free market for private transactions. This
system was abolished in November 1973 and monetary authorities may now
sell (but not buy) gold in the open market. The London fixing price remains
the basis on which most of the world’s non-monetary gold is traded. Forward
prices may also be quoted on request. Monetary authorities may now also

pledge gold as collateral to loans at a price decided between themselves with¬
out reference to the official gold price.
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, many
countries tended to use sterling as their currency for international transactions.
As trade and payments arrangements have become more diversified in recent
years, the international use of sterling has declined relatively. However, a
number of countries hold sterling balances in Britain (see p. 195). The term
‘sterling area’ includes all the Commonwealth countries (see p. 22) and their
dependencies except Canada and Rhodesia, together with Bahrain, Iceland,
the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, The Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar,
South Africa, South West Africa, The United Arab Emirates and the People’s
Democratic Republic of Yemen. The ‘overseas sterling area’ consists of the
sterling area countries except for the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man, the Irish Republic and Gibraltar.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Traditionally Britain’s balance of payments has been characterised by a deficit
on visible trade usually more than offset by a surplus on invisible earnings.
Estimates of the balance of payments and its main constituent items are given
in summary since 1966 in Table 35 and in greater detail since 1971 in Tables
36 and 37. The balance of payments statistics contain two indicators of
particular importance. The first is the balance on current account, covering
both visible (exports and imports of goods) and invisible (trade in services,
investment income and transfers) transactions. This, together with capital
transfers, provides a measure of how far Britain is paying its way abroad and
thus adding to or using up overseas assets. The second indicator is the total
currency flow. This is the net result of all external flows, that is the current
account, capital transfers, investment and other capital flows (including
official long-term capital transactions, investment flows, trade credit, and
changes in Britain’s external banking and money market liabilities in sterling)
and other flows which are unidentified transactions reflected in the balancing
item. The total currency flow shows the impact of all external flows on the
reserves and debt position, that is, how much is available to add to the reserves
and to repay any official borrowing in the case of a net inflow, or how much
must be financed by drawing on the reserves or by borrowing if there is a net
outflow. Table 36 gives details of the current account since 1971. Both exports
and imports rose strongly after the devaluation of sterling in 1967. In 1971
exports rose in value faster than imports resulting in the highest-ever surplus
on visible trade of £285 million which, together with a substantial surplus on
invisibles, produced a record current account surplus of £1,093 million. This
trend was reversed in 1972 with the development of a visible trade deficit
reflecting both the rise in world commodity prices and the depreciation of
sterling from June 1972. The surplus on invisibles more than matched the
trade deficit leaving a small surplus on current account. In 1973 further
rise in commodity prices, including oil prices, and the continued depreciation
of sterling resulted in a large visible deficit of £2,375 million, offset, to some
extent, by a surplus on invisibles of £1,165 million—£374 midion more than
that in 1972.
In the period 1963-68, there was a total currency outward flow of £3,778
million (including a gold subscription of £44 million to the IMF) financed
mainly by official borrowing totalling £3,134 million, but also by transfers to

the reserves of the dollar portfolio totalling £520 million; and a reduction of
£124 million in the reserves. In 1969 there was a reversal of the net currency
flow, and a rapidly increasing currency inflow which in 1971 reached £2,228
million. During this period almost all short- and medium-term official
borrowing was repaid, and there was a substantial increase in the reserves. In
1972 there was again a currency outflow of £1,265 million. In 1973, how¬
ever, there was a net currency inflow of £210 million despite the large current
account deficit and payments of compensation totalling ^59 million made in
implementation of the guarantee clauses of the sterling agreements of 1968, as
renewed in 1971 (see p. 195).
There was a net inflow in 1973 on identified investment and other capital
transactions of some j£ 1,071 million, reflecting in particular public sector over¬
seas currency borrowing of about £ 1,100 million, mainly under the exchange
cover scheme re-introduced in March 1973 (see p. 200). Overseas investment
in the private sector increased significantly in 1973 to £1,440 million, largely

because of a recovery in inward direct investment and in oil investment from
the exceptionally low 1972 level. Private investment overseas, at £1,382
million, was slightly lower than in 1972. Direct investment overseas, which
included a substantial element of reinvested profits and also a number of large
acquisitions of overseas companies by British ones, rose sharply; but the large
portfolio investment (see p. 390) outflows in 1972 were reversed in 1973.

EXTERNAL
ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES
External Assets
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain participates in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) scheme which
came into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves. SDRs are
reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the members of the IMF.
Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its share is based on its
IMF quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obligation to provide con¬
vertible currency, when designated by the IMF to do so, to another participant
in exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to twice the net amount of
their own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries with a sufficiently strong
balance of payments are so designated by the IMF. SDRs may also be used in
certain direct payments between participants in the scheme and for payments
of various kinds to the IMF.
In 1972 Britain’s official financing requirement was reduced to £1,141
million by an IMF allocation of £124 million of SDRs which was taken into
the reserves.
In June 1974 members of the IMF agreed to the establishment of the
‘Witteveen facility’1—a source of borrowing offered by oil producers, allowing
member countries affected particularly adversely by increased oil prices to
obtain funds on concessionary terms. Some $3.5 thousand million was made
available in 1974 and a similar amount for 1975.
Britain has also taken part since 1961 in the international network of re¬
ciprocal credit (swap) facilities arranged between central banks. Under these
arrangements each central bank is able to exchange on request its own currency
for the currency of another country up to a maximum agreed for a limited
period. It agrees to reverse the transaction at a specified date at the same rate
of exchange. The currencies so obtained can be retained in the reserves or used
in exchange operations.
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities2 is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included
that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of valua¬
tion. The inventory for the end of 1973 shows that Britain had a substantial
net creditor position estimated at some £6,130 million.
Britain’s assets arising from private investment overseas are estimated to have
been £19,980 million at the end of 1973. This compares with a figure of
£8,070 million at the end of 1962. Direct investment, including oil, accounted
for £13,030 million of the total figure for end 1973, the balance consisting of
£6,950 million of portfolio investment.
United Kingdom banking and commercial claims at the end of 1973 totalled
£4,872 million. Within this total banking claims were £2,749 million; suppliers’
export credit to unrelated firms was £1,736 million. With the increase in
recent years in British aid to developing countries, inter-governmental loans
of £1,074 million form the largest item among official external assets, which
at the end of 1973 were £2,517 million including refinanced export credit.
The latter figure, together with official reserves of £2,237 million, £4,872
million in banking and commercial claims and private investment overseas of
£19,980 million, resulted in aggregate identified external assets at the end of
1973 of some £29,605 million.
1 Named after the managing director of the IMF, Mr. Johannes Witteveen, who
proposed the facility.

graphy, p. 478).

Identified external liabilities at the end of 1973 are estimated to have been
some £23,475 million. All official short- and medium-term liabilities to the
IMF and other monetary authorities were repaid in 1972. Inter-governmental
loans to Britain and other official liabilities, mainly a consequence of the
second world war and its aftermath, totalled £1,545 million at the end of
1973 of which £1,205 million was owed to the United States and £295 million
to Canada. Other public sector liabilities of £3,742 million comprised overseas
holdings of British government and public corporations’ sterling securities,
holdings of Treasury bills and notes, local authorities’ securities and mort¬
gages, and foreign currency borrowings by British public corporations and
local authorities. British banking and commercial liabilities, including liabili¬
ties in sterling and in foreign currencies, totalled £8,018 million.1 Liabilities in
the form of overseas investment in Britain’s private sector totalled £10,170
million.
Liabilities in sterling comprise both public sector and banking and money-
market liabilities within the totals above. Sterling held in Britain by foreigners
in the form of British government securities (where these were held by central
monetary institutions and international organisations other than the IMF),
bank deposits, deposits with local authorities and hire purchase companies,
and Treasury bills totalled £6,146 million at the end of March 1974. Of this,
£3,909 million was held by residents of overseas sterling countries (excluding
the Irish Republic), £756 million by residents of the European Community,
and £1,481 million by other holders. The total of these liabilities (excluding
the counterpart of borrowing) remained broadly constant between the end of
1945 and 1970 but rose sharply during 1971 and 1972, slowly in 1973 and
sharply again in the first half of 1974. They reflect the international trading
and reserve role of sterling and in part the financial services of the City.
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the British
economy rose from £3,165 million in 1962 to £10,170 million at the end of
1973-
Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale
of their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued.
Earnings and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1973
the inflow of direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil,
amounted to £1,440 million.
The value of overseas investment in the private sector at the end of 1973
comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by companies in¬
corporated abroad—£4,620 million (excluding oil, banking, and insurance);
portfolio holdings of British securities—£2,925 million; the book value of the
net assets in Britain of overseas oil companies—£1,700 million; and the balance
of £925 million which included borrowing by British companies overseas and
identified overseas investment in real estate and in the insurance industry in
Britain.
About three-quarters of the direct investment of £4,620 million originally
came from North America and about one-fifth from Western Europe. Of the
£572 million inflow of direct investment into Britain in 1973 £26 million
originated from the overseas sterling countries and £546 million from the rest
of the world. Foreign investment inflow brings a number of benefits to British

industry, including technological development which in turn will strengthen
the economy and its balance of payments position.
Private investment abroad may take several forms: portfolio investment, that
is, investment in overseas securities including the loans raised by overseas
countries on the London capital market; or direct investment by the establish¬
ment of subsidiary companies abroad; or the acquisition of an interest in an
overseas enterprise.
Approval is readily obtained for financing direct investment projects by
borrowing abroad on appropriate terms. There is also scope for the investment
of retained profits of subsidiary companies overseas. In recent years a consider¬
able proportion of net direct investment outflow has been financed in this way.
Sterling finance is available in certain cases when projects promise early and
substantial benefits to Britain’s balance of payments.
Direct investment outflow, excluding oil, was £1,345 million in 1973 com¬
pared with £731 million in 1972. The latest available area analysis indicates
that of the 1972 figure £227 million was placed in overseas sterling countries
and £504 million in the rest of the world. Within the latter figure the flow to
EEC countries was £222 million, to EFTA £52 million and to Latin America
£52 million. In the same year the flow to Western Europe was £278 million
compared with a flow to North America of £161 million. With the inclusion of
oil, portfolio and other investment, aggregate private investment outflows
totalled £1,382 million in 1973 compared with £1,408 million in 1972, port¬
folio investment of £605 million in 1972 being followed by net disinvestment
of £229 million in 1973.
BRITISH
GOVERNMENT
AID TO
DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES
Britain’s aid programme to the developing countries consists of loans and
grants for economic and social development, technical assistance, budget
support and contributions to multilateral agencies providing financial aid and
technical assistance to these countries. To complement the official programme
private investment is encouraged by the provision of government insurance
to private investors by the ECGD (see p. 49). In addition an important
contribution is made to economic development by private voluntary organisa¬
tions engaged in relief, development and educational work.
Since 1945 total official aid disbursements have amounted to nearly £3,920
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1970-73
was about £279 million (see Table 38). In 1973 the total was some £304
million, of which bilateral aid accounted for £238 million including £73
million technical assistance; assistance provided through multilateral agencies
was £66 million. Repayments of capital and payments of interest during the
year on loans made previously came to £41 million and £35 million respec¬
tively. In recognition of the special importance of the role of official develop¬
ment assistance, the strategy for the Second UN Development Decade,
adopted in 1970, included a recommendation that each developed country
should progressively increase its official development assistance to the develop¬
ing countries and exert its best efforts to contribute a minimum net amount of
07 per cent of its gross national product (GNP) to them by the middle of the
decade. Britain has now accepted in principle the 0-7 per cent GNP target and
will seek to move towards it as best it can in the years ahead. Britain has also
accepted the UN target of 1 per cent of GNP for total net financial flows (that
is, including private investment and other flows) to developing countries.
In 1973 gross disbursements of British official flows were £303-9 million; net
of amortisation receipts, these amounted to £262-5 million (0-37 per cent of
Bilateral
Financial Aid
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 391
GNP). The gross aid programme for 1974-75 at current prices is £363-4
million. The aid programme for 1975-76 to 1978-79 will be determined as
part of the review of all public expenditure.
Bilateral financial aid in 1973 totalled £238 million; over 53 per cent was in
grants and the rest in loans. Budgetary aid, £6 million in 1973, is provided in
the form of grants. Development aid is in grants or loans, depending on the
economic and constitutional circumstances of the recipient countries; the
greater part of it is in loans. The terms of new development loans from Britain
have been progressively softened since 1958 and a policy of making interest-
free loans to lighten the repayment burdens of the poorer developing countries
was introduced in June 1965. In 1973 the total value of bilateral loan commit¬
ments entered into by the British Government, excluding investments by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (see p. 392), was £107 million and
of this over 68 per cent was on interest-free terms and over 77 per cent at an
interest rate of 2 per cent or less. The recipients included India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Bolivia, South Vietnam and Indonesia.
Where loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 2
per cent to 6 per cent, and both kinds of loan carry from two to seven years’
grace periods during which repayments of capital are not made. Of all loans
committed in 1973 the average maturity was 25 years. Britain has more than
fulfilled the 1969 recommendations of the Development Assistance Com¬
mittee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) on easing the terms of financial aid; and fully subscribes to new 1972
recommendations which simplify and improve the terms of financial aid to be
aimed at, and which introduce specially softer terms for a group of least-
developed countries.
Loans and grants are tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and services
from Britain, although there may be a limited element for local costs and a
foreign content not exceeding 20 per cent in contracts financed from tied aid

in appropriate cases. Between 1958 and the end of 1973, 403 loans were
negotiated involving a commitment of ,£1,266 million, of which £1,095 million
has been disbursed. The recipients of the largest amounts have been India
and Pakistan. During the same period bilateral grant commitments amounted
to around £1,244 million.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains
on the Commonwealth which includes among its members some of the world’s
poorest countries. In 1973 £191 million (80 per cent) of the bilateral pro¬
gramme was disbursed to Commonwealth countries and dependencies.
In the past, development aid to the dependent territories was given under
the Colonial Development and Welfare (CD & W) Acts, largely in the form
of grants. Expenditure on economic and social development up to the termina¬
tion of the Acts on 31st March 1970 amounted to some £450 million. The aid
requirements of the few remaining dependencies, which are regarded as a first
charge on aid funds, are now provided under the authority of the Overseas
Aid Act 1966. In 1973 the territories received £22 million in bilateral financial
aid and technical assistance.
An important role in development assistance is played by the Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), set up by the British Government
in 1948, which provides finance and management for development projects
in Commonwealth countries and dependencies, often in partnership with
governments or private enterprise. In 1969 the CDC’s borrowing powers were
increased and the area of its operations was extended to non-Commonwealth
countries. By the end of 1973 some £181 million had been invested out of a
total commitment of £243 million. Of the latter, £57 million was in the Far
East, £57 million in the Caribbean and virtually all of the remainder in Africa.
New commitments approved in 1973 totalled over £48 million.
Expenditure on bilateral technical assistance (the provision of skilled person¬
nel, advice and training) has increased in recent years and was £73 million,
30 per cent of total aid, in 1973. The largest component of expenditure (£32
million in 1973) was on sending or maintaining experts, including volunteers;
the next largest was for students and trainees in Britain (£12 million).
Under the Overseas Service Aid Scheme (OSAS) and associated schemes
Britain meets the additional costs of employing experienced expatriate British
personnel in the public services of developing countries. The schemes cost
£16 million in 1973.
During 1973, of the 11,983 British persons other than volunteers who were
working in developing countries and financed by the British Government,
some 5,519 were engaged in the field of education, 2,216 in public works and
communications, 1,231 in public administration, 1,227 in agriculture and
allied fields, and 665 in health services.
In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme in 1973 there were
2,705 volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in develop¬
ing countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing
overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies; 75 per cent of the British
costs (£0-9 million in 1973) are met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 15,002 were financed in Britain in 1973 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical assistance, by awards under the Commonwealth Educa-
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Multilateral
Contributions

tion Co-operation Scholarships and Education Fellowship Schemes, and under
the various schemes of the British Council.
Britain is the second largest subscriber (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Development Association (IDA) and the Inter¬
national Finance Corporation. The British commitment to IDA in the three
years 1971-73 was nearly £141 million; the proposed contribution for the three
years 1974-76 is over ^206 million. Britain has contributed, or has agreed to
contribute, to the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Develop¬
ment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the African Development
Bank. Britain has contributed £74 million to the United Nations Development
Programme since its inception in 1950 and has provided more experts and
training places under multilateral schemes than any other country. Over
1,500 British nationals were serving in developing countries under the United
Nations and its specialised agencies in 1973. Other contributions include
those to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
(UNRWA), the World Food Programme and the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF).
As a result of its accession to the European Community, Britain is now
contributing to Community aid programmes; it is a party to the Community’s
association agreement with Turkey, is participating fully in Community food
aid programmes, and has contributed to Community emergency actions, for
example, in the Sahel. When the new convention of association with African,
Caribbean and Pacific states enters into force, Britain will begin to contribute
to the European Development Fund and it is playing its full part in elaborating
overall Community development assistance policies within which Com¬
munity aid should be extended to other areas of the world, including the
Mediterranean, Asia and Latin America. The combined effect of these activi¬
ties may eventually be to increase substantially British multilateral aid as a
percentage of the whole British aid programme.
19 Promotion of the
Sciences
The Government is the main source of funds for scientific research and
development as a whole though private industry contributes a larger propor¬
tion of funds for civil research and development. Funds are also provided by
public corporations, independent trusts and foundations, and learned societies.
The Government keeps under review facilities for training scientists and
ensures that adequate research is directed to matters of national interest.
The Pattern of Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development in 1969-70
Expenditure amounted to £1,082 million compared with £658 million in 1961-62. The
proportion this represented of the gross domestic product remained steady
throughout the 1960s at between 27 and 2-8 per cent. There were, however,
divergent trends in some of the components. The share of defence almost
halved during the period whereas that for civil purposes was rising. Civil
research and development financed from non-government funds represented
an increased share of the total claim on resources in 1966-67 compared with
earlier years, but has remained fairly constant since.
The Government continues to finance just over half the research and
development and to carry out about a quarter in its own establishments.
Expenditure by the research councils on research and development is estimated
at about £125 million in 1973-74.
THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 central responsibility for basic
civil science rests with the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who
is advised by the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (see p. 395).
Responsibility for technology rests mainly with the Secretary of State for
Industry. Other government departments are responsible for research and
development related to their executive responsibilities. In 1972 the Govern¬
ment announced its decision (published in Cmnd 5046: see Bibliography,
p. 478) to extend the customer-contractor approach to all its applied research
and development, as recommended in a report by Lord Rothschild, head of
the Central Policy Review Staff (see p. 45). This approach means that govern¬
ment departments, as customers, define their requirements; contractors (the
research councils or others) advise on the feasibility of meeting the require¬
ments and undertake the work; and the arrangements between them must
ensure that the objectives remain attainable within reasonable costs. This
decision has involved organisational and financial changes affecting depart¬
ments and the research councils (see below). Departments concerned have
appointed Chief Scientists to co-ordinate their research needs. The decision
has involved also the transfer of certain funds from the Science Budget of the
Department of Education and Science to allow some departments to com¬
mission research on a customer/contractor basis. During the three-year period
I973-74to I975_7^> funds rising from £14-6 million to £28-4 million (at 1973
prices) are being transferred and these include provision for the Nature
Conservancy Council (see p. 396) and certain research undertaken by the Soil

Survey of England and Wales. Customer departments now commission
research, with transferred funds, from three research councils (Agricultural,
Medical and Natural Environment): these councils continue to receive pro¬
portionately reduced funds from the residual Science Budget.
The Government announced at the same time a new programme of training
and career development to equip scientists and other specialists for posts
primarily concerned with general policy and management.
The Department of Education and Science (see also p. 47) is responsible,
among other things, for government policy regarding the universities and for
promoting civil science throughout Great Britain. The department’s relations
with the universities are conducted through the University Grants Committee
(see p. 156); and its responsibilities for basic and applied civil science are
discharged mainly through the five research councils: the Science Research
Council (see p. 401), the Medical Research Council (see p. 403), the Agricul¬
tural Research Council (see p. 404), the Natural Environment Research
Council (see p. 408), and the Social Science Research Council (see p. 409).
This remains the broad pattern despite the changes described above. The
department is also responsible for some aspects of international scientific
relations (see p. 411), and helps to co-ordinate government policy regarding
scientific and technical information.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils, set up in 1972 to replace the
former Council for Scientific Policy, advises the Secretary of State on respon¬
sibilities for civil science with special reference to the research council system,
the support of postgraduate students and the proper balance between inter¬
national and national scientific activities, and on the allocation of the science
budget between research councils and other bodies; and promotes close
liaison between the councils and users of their research. Its membership in¬
cludes the chairman or secretary of each of the five research councils, the
chairman of the University Grants Committee, senior scientists from depart¬
ments with a major interest in the work of the research councils, and in¬
dependent members drawn from the universities, industry and the Royal
Society of London. One of the independent members is appointed part-time
chairman.
The Department of the Environment is concerned with research and develop¬
ment for a whole range of functions which affect the environment (see p. 48).
The department’s research programme, which is the responsibility of the
Directorate General of Research, is carried out or controlled by its research
establishments, the Building Research Establishment (BRE), the Transport
and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), and the Hydraulics Research Station
(HRS). The department has its research requirements committees, each based
on a particular policy subject, through which the customer requirements for
research are formulated. A substantial part of the total programme is under¬
taken by outside agencies.
The Building Research Establishment, which comprises the former Build¬
ing Research Station, Fire Research Station and Forest Products Research
Laboratory, is concerned with research into all building materials, the tech¬
niques of building design and construction, and the organisation, productivity
and economics of building work. The BRE also conducts research into all
aspects of fire and the danger it represents to life and property.
The Transport and Road Research Laboratory provides technical and
scientific advice and information to help in formulating, developing, and
396 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
implementing government policies relating to roads and transport, including
their interaction with urban and regional planning. The TRRL’s main
activities are highway engineering, traffic engineering and safety, and transport
systems.
The main function of the Hydraulics Research Station is to predict the
performance of hydraulic civil engineering works and their consequences to
the environment. It is concerned with the flow of water in open channels,
including the hydraulics of rivers, estuaries, harbours and coasts.
The Water Research Centre, which became operative on 1st April 1974 at
the same time as the new Water Authorities in England and Wales (see p.
275), is based upon and absorbs the existing staff and programmes of the
Department of the Environment’s Water Pollution Research Laboratory,
Stevenage; the Water Research Association, Medmenham, Bucks; part of the
technology division of the former Water Resources Board, Reading (see p.
275)i and Part °f the programme of the Department of the Environment’s
Directorate General of Water Engineering. The Water Research Centre is
one of the four industrial research associations supported by the Department
of the Environment.
The department gives grants in aid of a number of organisations working in
research, which include: the Centre for Environmental Studies (see p. 171);
the Operational Research Unit of the Royal Institute of Public Administra¬
tion ; and the Royal Society, to meet costs it incurs as British representative on
the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis.
A Nature Conservancy Council, appointed by the Secretary of State for the
Environment under the Nature Conservancy Council Act 1973, is responsible
for the conservancy aspects of the former Nature Conservancy committee of
the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The research functions
remain with the NERC, under which they are carried out by the Institute of
Terrestrial Ecology (see p. 409).
The Department The Department of Industry (see also p. 402) is responsible for the sponsor-
of Industry ship of individual manufacturing industries including the aerospace industry,
for technical services to industry, and for industrial research and development,
including the supervision of the industrial research establishments of the
former Department of Trade and Industry, except for the Safety in Mines
Research Establishment (see p. 397). It also aids, with grants, autonomous
industrial research associations.
In accordance with the Government’s customer-contractor principle, the
department has a number of requirements boards to determine the objectives
and balance of its research and development programmes. They cover ship and
marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine tools; engineering
materials; computers, systems and electronics; chemicals and minerals;
metrology and standards; and fundamental standards. They are responsible
to the Secretary of State for Industry and include representatives from in¬
dustry and bodies in the public sector.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (see p. 53) has responsi¬
bility for standards and weights and measures, for the British Standards
Institution (see p. 218) and for the Metrication Board set up in 1969 to
facilitate the transition to the metric system of weights and measures in
Britain by 1975 (see p. 457).

ferred to the Executive of the Health and Safety Commission in January 1975
(see p. 350); research in support of the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas;
research into novel sources of energy; co-ordination of energy research within
government departments; and strategic oversight of the research programmes
of the coal, gas and electricity supply industries.
Branches of research for which government departments are responsible
include:
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (founded in 1759), together with its 400-
acre estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, is administered by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its research departments are: the herbarium
—also the largest in the world with between four and five million specimens—
concerned primarily with the classification and accurate determination of
plants; and the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant anatomy and plant
physiology, cytology and genetics. There is a seed bank and seed testing unit,
a biochemistry laboratory under the Agricultural Research Council and a cell
physiology laboratory which has a transmission electron microscope for
investigating reproductive physiology and the behaviour of certain glandular
cells. A scanning electron microscope for studies of the surface structures of
plants and pollen is housed in the Jodrell Laboratory. Three museums are
concerned with public exhibitions and the care of reference collections of
economic plant products. The library, in the same building as the herbarium,
was founded in 1852; it consists of more than 100,000 botanical books, about
140,000 reprints and separately issued items and a collection of over 160,000
drawings and paintings of plants.
The Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (founded in 1670), has, since 1969,
been administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scot¬
land. Together with the associated Logan Botanic Garden at Ardwell near
Stranraer, and the Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore near Dunoon, it
maintains large collections of living plants used for research into plant classi¬
fication. Glasshouses at Edinburgh make possible the cultivation of and
research into many tropical groups. The herbarium and library—the finest
outside London—are used for research in taxonomy, cytology, anatomy,
mycology and other subjects. A transmission electron microscope is used for
the study of fine detail of plant structures. An exhibition hall was opened on
the occasion of the tercentenary of the garden in 1970. The Scottish Gallery of
Modern Art is situated within the Garden.
The Post Office, for which the Department of Industry is the responsible
department, undertakes research and development on many aspects of the
science and engineering of communications, both in its own laboratories and
in close association with industry, the universities and government depart¬
ments. It has research stations at Dollis Hill, London, and Martlesham, near
Ipswich, and laboratories at Backwell, near Bristol, and at Castleton, near
Cardiff.

The Department of the Environment, under its Secretary of State, is res¬
ponsible for the total strategic approach to environmental management, pro¬
tection and improvement. Other government departments have certain specific
responsibilities for pollution control (for example, the Department of Trade
is responsible for oil pollution at sea and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food for pollution from pesticides). The Department of the Environ¬
ment has a small central environmental pollution unit to co-ordinate the work
of all government departments on the control of pollution and the British
contribution to international discussions on the subject.
In 1970 an independent standing Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution was set up to advise the Government on national and international
matters concerning the pollution of the environment; on the adequacy of
research; and on the future possibilities of danger to the environment. The
commission has so far published three reports (see Bibliography, p. 479). A
Clean Air Council was set up in 1956 and an Advisory Council on Noise in
1970.
A National Radiological Protection Board was established under the Radio¬
logical Protection Act 1970 to provide an authoritative point of reference for
Britain on radiological protection. The board, which carries out research,
makes public and occupational health assessments and provides services, has
assumed the functions of the former Radioactive Substances Advisory
Committee, the Radiological Protection Service—hitherto provided jointly by
the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Health Departments—and
part of the activities carried on by the central Health and Safety Branch of the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (AEA). The board is financed by
Parliament through the Secretary of State for Social Services and by grants
from the AEA and MRC and by income from services.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is respon¬
sible for research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly for civil purposes.
The headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are at Brack¬
nell, Berkshire. The Ministry of Defence also makes grants for fundamental
meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the Royal Society
(see below) or in university departments.
The Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence undertakes research
on civil aircraft, engines and equipment on behalf of the Department of
Industry. The Civil Aviation Research and Development Board advises the
Civil Aviation Authority on research and development work for which it is
responsible.
The sessional Select Committee of the House of Commons on Science and
Technology is one of the specialist committees established to give back-bench
members the opportunity to investigate the policies and administration of the
Government and to participate in the formation of policy (see p. 36). The
members of the committee (not more than 15 in number) are nominated by
the House. The committee has power to call witnesses, generally takes evi¬
dence in public, and reports its findings to the House from time to time.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, founded in 1939, provides for a
regular exchange of information between members of Parliament and scientists.
Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in both Houses,
and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific
and technological organisations as may be affiliated under its constitution.

THE LEARNED
SOCIETIES

Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread of
knowledge. The most eminent of those concerned with science in its broadest
aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests and activi¬
ties) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution and British
Association.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high honour. The Queen
is Patron. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows,
including the Queen Mother and two Royal Dukes; Foreign Members, of
whom there are about 70; and the main body of Fellows numbering about 760.
Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, was for many years restricted to
25 persons a year and the foreign membership to four a year but in 1965 the
former was increased to 32 with the intention of awarding some of the new
places to applied scientists in both the physical and biological sciences. The
society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings’,
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson and Henry Dale Research Professorships and 12 other
research professorships supported by parliamentary grant-in-aid. Research
fellowships in human nutrition supported by the J. Sainsbury Centenary
Grant were inaugurated in 1974. The highest medal awarded is the Copley
Medal, for which scientists from all countries are eligible; there are also three
Royal Medals, and the Rumford, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester, Hughes,
Leverhulme and Mullard Medals. There are six lectureships: the Croonian
(biology); the Bakerian (physical sciences); the Ferrier (nervous system); the
Wilkins (history of science); the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology); and the Bernal
(social functions of science). The society has set up committees, some of them
jointly with other bodies, to promote improvements in education in science
and to emphasise the importance of applied sciences, especially engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain of
its activities. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appoint¬
ments to research councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with research.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
Britain in the international unions comprising the International Council of
Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of them. It also
plays a leading part in international scientific programmes such as the Inter¬
national Biological Programme, and promotes exchange visits of scientists
with many academies throughout the world. Its International Fellowship
Scheme to foster relations with scientists of Western European and many
other countries receives financial support from the Government and other
sources.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,

artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754, one
of the society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and appli¬
cation to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this purpose
chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The society regularly holds
lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing effective media for
the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of developments which
have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge. Its
library includes many early scientific works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The association has area committees and three lectureships for
young scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to en¬
courage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also made an important contribution to the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
A Council for Science and Society was formed in 1973 by specialists in the
natural and social sciences, the law, and medicine to support and stimulate
research into the social effects of scientific and technological development. It is
financed initially by the Leverhulme Trust.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which are playing a distinguished part in promoting their own disciplines
or are interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Engineering Institutions, the federal body for the chartered
engineering institutions established in 1965, promotes the co-ordination of the
engineering profession. The Council of Science and Technology Institutes—
a federal body with five member institutes representing biologists, chemists,
mathematicians, metallurgists and physicists—was formed in 1969.
A fund was endowed in 1972 by the late Lord Rank to be used to reward out¬
standing contributions to human nutrition and crop husbandry, and to opto¬
electronics and nearly related phenomena.

THE UNIVER¬
SITIES AND
INSTITUTIONS
OF UNIVERSITY
STATUS
Of total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the academic
year 1971-72 (over £110-3 million), the largest government contribution (over
£49-6 million) was through the University Grants Committee (see p. 156).
Scientific research in the universities is also supported through the research
councils. This support takes two forms. First, about half the postgraduate
students in science and technology in the universities receive maintenance
awards from the research councils, through postgraduate scholarships, student¬
ships or fellowships. These awards are in some cases for periods of up to
three years of training in research work and in others for shorter periods for
advanced studies. The cost of these awards is currently about £10-5 million
a year. Second, grants are given to the universities by the research councils
for specific projects, particularly in new or developing fields of research. In
recent years the research councils, in addition to making grants of this kind,
have made funds available for expensive items of university equipment
required for specific programmes of research. The research councils’ support
for research in the universities and central facilities required for it, excluding
expenditure by the Medical Research Council and the Agricultural Research
Council on their own research units within the universities (which remain
under the control of, and are wholly financed by, the councils), amounted in
1971-72 to £23-8 million.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
University Grants Committee amount to about a third of the total university
expenditure on research.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects.
Statistics of
Qualified
Manpower
According to estimates in a survey published in 1971 (see Bibliography, p. 478)
there were in 1968 just over 400,000 persons with qualifications in engineering,
technology and science in Great Britain, of whom one-half were qualified
in science and one-half in engineering. Of those economically active (350,000),
53 per cent (185,000) held engineering qualifications, i-2 per cent (4,140) were
out of employment, and 35 per cent employed in manufacturing. Education
employed over 20 per cent and over the years 1959 to 1968 there was a rapid
increase in the service sectors (commerce and consultancy). Within manu¬
facturing the largest increase was in electrical and electronics industries (6 per
cent a year). Over the period 1959 to 1968 there was a net gain of scientists
from migration and a net loss of engineers and technologists.
SCIENCE
RESEARCH
COUNCIL
The Science Research Council (SRC) was established under Royal Charter in
1965 and consists of a chairman and 10-15 other members. It is supported by
grants-in-aid provided by Parliament through the Secretary of State for
Education and Science, and covers all branches of fundamental science other
than those for which the other research councils are responsible. Provision is
made for it to carry out research and development in science and technology
through its own establishments; to encourage and support similar research by
any other person or body; to provide and operate equipment for common use
by universities, polytechnics, technical colleges and similar institutions; to
make grants for postgraduate studies; and to disseminate knowledge of science
and technology. Its establishments are the Royal Greenwich Observatory,
402
INDUSTRIAL
RESEARCH
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Herstmonceux, the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, the Appleton Laboratory,
the Rutherford Laboratory, the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory, and
the Atlas Computer Laboratory. The SRC also administers the British
scientific space research programme (see p. 407) and provides contributions
to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), the civil science
programme of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and part of
the United Kingdom’s contribution to the European Space Agency (see p.
407).
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the research
organisations of the larger firms and in government research establishments.
Other main agencies are universities and technical colleges, industrial research
associations, independent institutes for sponsored research and consultant
laboratories.
Department of The Department of Industry has direct control of five industrial research
Industry establishments—the National Engineering Laboratory (which includes the
Birniehill Institute), the National Physical Laboratory, Warren Spring
Laboratory, the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, and the Computer
Aided Design Centre.
Besides research and development for industry the industrial research
establishments are engaged on the application of new techniques and dis¬
coveries to design, production, quality control and distribution. The depart¬
ment also sponsors research by grants-in-aid to research associations and by
extra-mural contracts with industry, research associations, and universities.
The Department The Department of the Environment is responsible for the Transport and
of the Road Research Laboratory, the Hydraulics Research Station, and the Building
Environment Research Establishment.
Research
Associations
Public
Corporations
The scheme by which the Government has given financial help to firms with
similar interests to form organisations known as research associations, to carry
out industrial research co-operatively, was started in 1917. There are now 29
such associations linked with the Department of Industry. In addition there
are four (Water; Construction; Heating and Ventilating; and Timber) linked
with the Department of the Environment, and four (Flour Milling and
Baking; Fruit and Vegetable Preservation; British Food Manufacturing
Industries; and British Industrial Biological Research) linked with the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Suitably specialised associations
are now available for about 50 per cent of British industry. They accounted in
1972 for about 1 -5 per cent of national research and development expenditure.
The largest are those dealing with production engineering, ships, welding,
electrical manufacturing, cotton and man-made fibres, non-ferrous metals and
scientific instruments. (See also Chapter 12.) The amounts of the government
grants are related to the contributions made by the industries concerned; the
grants are now being reduced, each industry bearing an increasing proportion
of the cost of its associations. A Conference of Industrial Research Associa¬
tions was set up in 1969.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 13), in particular those con¬
cerned with fuel and power, steel and transport. They also give support to
organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.

According to Research and Development Expenditure (see Bibliography, p. 479),
expenditure on research and development carried out within or financed by
private industry in 1969-70 was £710-8 million of which £227*7 million came
from government funds. Expenditure in individual industries, including funds
from government sources, was as follows (in £ million): aerospace 171*3;
electronics (including computers) 146*7; other electrical engineering 40*3;
petroleum products 11*7; other chemical products 96; mechanical engineering
61 *i; motor vehicles 49*1', scientific instruments 17*4; food, drink and tobacco
22*8; textiles 15*7. Firms in science-based industries commit large private
funds to research and development in the course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
In these institutes research for private firms is carried out confidentially, the
results remaining the property of the sponsor.
The Government gives substantial support to medical research both by
financing the Medical Research Council and through block grants to uni¬
versities distributed through the Department of Education and Science and
the University Grants Committee. It supports clinical research through the
Department of Health and Social Security and the National Health Service.
Certain government-financed research for defence purposes, for example, at
the Microbiological Establishment at Porton, Wiltshire, has civil applications
related to medical science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by private
charities or voluntary organisations, such as the Nuffield Foundation and the
Cancer Research Campaign.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) was established under Royal Charter
in 1920, as successor to a Medical Research Committee first appointed in 1913.
The Council, which now consists of a chairman, deputy chairman and 14-18
other members, was granted a new Charter in 1966 (since further amended)
and is supported by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the Secretary
of State for Education and Science.
The MRC’s principal objectives are: to advance knowledge that will im¬
prove physical and mental health; and to develop the biomedical sciences as
such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher
education. The council is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology
and Mental Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physio¬
logical Systems and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research
Board. The Council is also advised by an Environmental Medicine (Research
Policy) Committee on policy for the support of research on environmental,
occupational and social medicine problems that often extends beyond the
responsibility of its advisory boards. In addition, the MRC is advised by
committees concerned with particular aspects of its work and with research
grants. The MRC’s arrangements for the support of research fall under four
main headings: investigations by members of its scientific staff, mostly work¬
ing in its own establishments; short-term (‘project’) grants to workers in
universities and elsewhere; long-term grants in support of specific research
programmes in university departments (‘programme grants’ and ‘research
groups’); and research training awards (fellowships and scholarships) tenable
both at home and overseas. The research undertaken ranges from basic
404 BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
biological research at the molecular level and the extensive laboratory work that
forms the scientific basis of the practice of medicine to the study of patients
and epidemiological and population surveys carried out in this area.
The MRC’s main research establishments are the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, and the Clinical Research Centre at
Northwick Park, London, which forms an integral part of the new district
hospital. In addition the council has over 70 research units, which are mostly
located in university departments, medical schools and hospitals in Britain.
The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
the Ministry of Overseas Development (see p. 411), maintains laboratories in
The Gambia and a unit in Jamaica.
AGRICULTURAL
AND FISHERIES
RESEARCH
Agricultural
Research
Council
Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council, the
government agricultural departments and by private industry. Fisheries re¬
search is carried out by the government fisheries departments, the White Fish
Authority, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Marine Biological
Association, the Scottish Marine Biological Association and the Freshwater
Biological Association. Expenditure on research and development by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1973-74 totalled £15-8 million
of which £6-9 million had been transferred from the Science Budget (see p.
394) of the Department of Education and Science.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931 under Royal
Charter (since amended), consists of a chairman and 18-21 other members. It
is supported by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the Secretary of
State for Education and Science.
The ARC is responsible for 14 independent state-aided agricultural research
institutes and also has eight institutes under its direct control and 11 units
which it has established under distinguished scientists associated with uni¬
versities. Also there are eight independent institutes in Scotland financed by
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland with advice from
the ARC on their scientific programmes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC also makes special research grants to support promising new lines
of work in university departments. It makes a limited number of postgraduate
training awards.
Government
Agricultural
Departments
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic
research. At its Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and
laboratory investigations are carried out into the causes, pathology, epi-
zootiology and control of diseases of farm livestock, including poultry; the
diagnosis of animal and poultry diseases (other than foot-and-mouth disease);
and the making and supplying of certain biological products. The laboratory
is, by appointment of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the third
international laboratory for biological standards. There is a related Ministry
Veterinary Laboratory at Lasswade, Midlothian. The Plant Pathology
Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is concerned with plant quarantine
matters, the standards for improved crop planting material, pest and disease
assessment work, the clearance of pesticides for safety and their official
approval for biological efficiency. The Pest Infestation Control Laboratory at
Slough, Berkshire (with stations at Tolworth and Worplesdon, Surrey),
engages in research work on insects, mites and fungi affecting food storage and
on harmful mammals and birds. It provides the scientific basis for advisory
work on their detection and control and acts as an instruction and liaison

centre for home and overseas work, and is concerned with the clearance of
pesticides for safety.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
Division provides advice on scientific and technical aspects of food. Particular
attention is paid to the safety, quality and nutritive value of food, including
consideration of food additives and contaminants. Close liaison is maintained
with the Department of Health and Social Security, which has responsibilities
for public health, and with other government departments. The division has
facilities for experimental work in Norwich and London. There is an increasing
demand for advice in connection with international work, including the Euro¬
pean Community food legislation, and also regarding the new government
policies for the support of research at the four food research associations and
elsewhere.
In Scotland research work at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Agricultural
Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is mainly
concerned with the problems of cultivar taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed
potato production, plant pathology, and the ecology of birds, mammals and
insects harmful to agriculture and stored products. In Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for promotion of research in food pro¬
duced by agriculture and in veterinary sciences with the aim of improving
efficiency of production, marketability of foods and the health of plants and
animals. The ministry is also responsible for work on forest science, ecology of
freshwater and marine fish as well as on the biology of freshwater resources.
The ARC, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Depart¬
ment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland have set up a Joint Consulta¬
tive Organisation to advise on the programmes and priorities for government-
financed research and development in food and agriculture. The organisation
consists of five boards—three commodity boards, covering animals, arable
crops and forage, and horticulture; and two special subject boards for food
science and technology, and engineering and buildings. The Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has appointed a chief scientist who is respon¬
sible for scientific advice to the ministry on the broad range of policy matters
with which it deals and also for framing, commissioning and reviewing the
ministry’s research and development programmes and in determining the
order of priorities between them.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains five laboratories
for marine fisheries and shellfish research, one for salmon and freshwater
fisheries research, one concerned with landing and preservation of the fish
catch and with studies of fish as food and one specialising in research into fish
diseases. There are four sea-going research ships and several smaller vessels
for inshore and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and six research ships at
Aberdeen, and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board representative of govern¬
ment departments and the industry advises fisheries ministers on research
programmes, objectives and priorities. A Controller of Fisheries Research and
Development, responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland, co-ordinates the programmes of
the research laboratories.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvi¬
cultural and allied problems (see p. 300). By means of grants, it also aids forest

research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions, in¬
cluding the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
In 1974 the Commission’s research establishments were reorganised. All
research and development activities were amalgamated within a research and
development division; and the study of hardwood trees was given more
emphasis, with the concentration of work on lowland forests, amenity and
landscape at Alice Holt Lodge near Farnham, Surrey, and the replacement of
the Soils Research Branch by two Site Studies Branches.
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible under the Atomic Energy
Act 1946 for promoting and controlling the development of nuclear energy
and ensuring that the proper degrees of importance are attached to its various
applications. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up
under the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954, is the main body carrying out
research and development in nuclear energy. As an essential part of the British
Government’s nuclear power programme, the AEA has carried out research
and developed new types of nuclear power stations for the generation of
electric power on a commercial scale and for this purpose it builds and operates
experimental and prototype nuclear reactors. Construction of commercial
nuclear power stations is carried out by industry to the order of the electricity
generating boards which operate them. A single British nuclear reactor con¬
struction company, the National Nuclear Corporation, has been formed to
replace the two consortia set up in 1968 to design and construct nuclear power
stations (see p. 268). Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 the func¬
tions of the AEA have been extended so that the Government may, after
consultation, require it to undertake research and development outside nuclear
energy and this now yields an income of some £4 million a year.
The assets and liabilities of the AEA’s trading fund were transferred under
the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1971 to two statutory companies—British
Nuclear Fuels Limited and The Radiochemical Centre Limited. The establish¬
ments of British Nuclear Fuels Limited include those at Springfields, Capen-
hurst, Chapelcross and the Windscale and Calder Works. Those of The
Radiochemical Centre Limited include the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham,
and its facilities at Harwell. The Reactor Group Laboratories at Springfields
and Windscale and the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) at Windscale
remain with the AEA.
The Secretary of State for Defence became responsible for the development
and production of nuclear weapons for the Services in 1966; in practice,
however, the AEA produced the explosive nuclear material and assemblies for
nuclear weapons under contract and carried out weapons research. Under the
Atomic Energy Authority (Weapons Group) Act 1973 the activities of the
AEA’s Weapons Group (the Atomic Weapons Establishment) were transferred
to the Ministry of Defence from 1st April 1973.
The Department of Industry and the AEA are jointly responsible for co¬
operation with other countries in nuclear energy, partly through the medium
of bilateral agreements with a large number of individual countries and partly
through British membership of bodies such as the International Atomic
Energy Agency and the European Nuclear Energy Agency.
Britain became a full member of the European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom) on 1st January 1973 (see p. 76) under the Treaty of Accession and
under its terms agreed to accept the Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957, under
which Euratom was set up, and rules made under it. Britain is taking part in

the four-year Euratom research and training programme agreed in February
1973 and costing over ^70 million. The AEA co-operates in the Community’s
five-year programme of research into thermonuclear fusion.
The provision of facilities for research in high energy physics is the function
of the Science Research Council (SRC) (see p. 401). The SRC establishments
concerned are the Rutherford Laboratory, Chilton, with a 7 GeV (thousand
million electron volt) proton synchrotron (particle accelerator), and the Dares-
bury Laboratory, Cheshire, with a 5 GeV electron synchrotron. Experiments
at higher energies are carried out by the European Organisation for Nuclear
Research (CERN) to which Britain contributes through the SRC.
The SRC shares with its French and West German partners the control of the
Institut Max von Laue-Paul Langevin (ILL) which operates a high flux
reactor at Grenoble for neutron beam research.
Government responsibility for space activities is undertaken by the Secretary
of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence and the
Secretary of State for Industry, according to the nature of the project, while the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is concerned with
international aspects. Total expenditure on space activities in 1973-74 was
about £37 million.
The United Kingdom with other European Governments is establishing a
European Space Agency (ESA) which is expected to come into existence
before the end of 1974. This new organisation will supersede the European
Space Vehicle Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and European
Space Research Organisation (ESRO) of which the United Kingdom was a
founder member. Among its main responsibilities will be the establishment of
a single co-ordinated European space programme.
The decision to set up the ESA was taken in 1973 at a meeting of the Euro¬
pean Space Conference (a ministerial conference which first met in 1966). The
conference also agreed in principle on the implementation of three new major
European space projects—Ariane, Spacelab and Marots.
The civil scientific space research programme is administered by the SRC,
which is responsible to the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
Opportunities are provided for research workers to carry out experiments
in Britain’s national satellite and sounding rocket programme, in the ESRO
scientific satellite programme and in various collaborative sounding rocket
programmes through bilateral and multilateral arrangements with other
countries, including the Commonwealth collaborative programme. Britain is
co-operating with the United States in a programme which includes American
launching of the British Ariel series of scientific satellites, the incorporation of
British experiments in American satellites and the analyses of lunar surface
samples.
Responsibility for industrial sponsorship of the space industry for Britain’s
space technology programme and for leading the British delegation to the
European Space Conference rests with the Department of Industry. The
technology programme, now known as the Domestic Space Technology
Programme (DSTP) is intended to develop Britain’s industrial capability in
space applications systems. A series of wholly British technology proving
satellites, which culminated in the launching of Miranda in March 1974, has
been terminated following the decision to set up ESA. Work undertaken
408
BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
within the DSTP is managed by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry
of Defence on behalf of the Department of Industry.
The Department of Industry, through the Post Office, is responsible for
the use of satellites for civil communications purposes and undertakes research
work in connection with communications systems using satellites. Britain and
82 other countries participate in the permanent International Telecommunica¬
tions Satellite Organisation (INTELSAT) which started operating early in
1973 in place of the consortium formed in 1964. Britain is the second largest
shareholder and is represented on the organisation’s board of governors by the
Post Office. The Post Office ground stations at Goonhilly in Cornwall are
among the most successful in the world; British firms have built such stations
overseas, and are currently fulfilling further export orders as members of
international consortia.
Scientific space experiments are undertaken by scientists in universities
and in government research establishments. The Appleton Laboratory of the
SRC at Slough provides support and services for the national scientific space
research programmes and also operates the United States National Aero¬
nautics and Space Administration (NASA) Satellite Tracking and Data
Acquisition Network (STADAN) station at Winkfield. Telemetry facilities
for the Department of Industry’s technology satellites are situated at Lasham,
Hampshire, with data processing and analysis being undertaken by Space
Department, Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, which also under¬
takes long-term research and development intended to assist industry. Optical
tracking of satellites is undertaken by many individual observers in Britain
and by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory’s outstation (see below); the pre¬
diction and co-ordination centre is at the Appleton Laboratory, which is also
the home of one of the three World Data Centres for space research.
The Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental international
scientific groups such as the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
OPTICAL AND
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
Optical astronomy is carried out in university departments and in the Royal
Greenwich Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, under the
Science Research Council (SRC). SRC has set out to increase the facilities
available to university and observatory astronomers. The 98-in (245 cm) Isaac
Newton Telescope at the Royal Greenwich Observatory was commissioned
in 1967 and is operated as a national facility. A 150-in (375 cm) telescope is
nearing completion at Siding Spring Mountain in Australia as a joint Anglo-
Australian project, while a British 48-in (120 cm) Schmidt Telescope has been
installed on the same site. Optical telescopes operated by the South African
Astronomical Observatory, to which the SRC contributes, are available for use
by British astronomers.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research
in radio astronomy with substantial support from SRC. The fully steerable
250-ft (76*2 m) telescope at Jodrell Bank (University of Manchester) has been
modernised. The Cambridge University group at Lord’s Bridge has developed
and made substantial use of the aperture synthesis technique; two telescopes
with i-6i km (1 mile) and o*8 km (0-5 mile) arrays have been complemented
by a third telescope array 5 km (3*1 miles) long.
THE NATURAL The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which consists of a
ENVIRONMENT chairman and 13-18 other members, was established by Royal Charter in 1965
under the Science and Technology Act to encourage, plan and execute research

in those sciences, physical and biological, that relate to man’s natural environ¬
ment and its resources. This research seeks to provide a better understanding
not only of the nature, resources and processes of the human environment, but
also of their influence on man’s activities and welfare and of man’s influence
on them. Sciences supported by the NERC comprise: geology, geophysics,
and geochemistry; physical oceanography and marine biology; hydrology and
freshwater biology; terrestrial ecology and conservation; forestry; and
meteorology.
The NERC, which is supported by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament
through the Secretary of State for Education and Science, carries out research
and training through its own institutes, through grant-aided institutes, and by
grants, fellowships, and postgraduate awards to universities and other institutes
of higher education.
The council’s institutes are: British Antarctic Survey; Culture Centre of
Algae and Protozoa; Institute of Geological Sciences; Institute of Hydrology;
Institute of Marine Environmental Research; Institute of Oceanographic
Sciences; Institute of Terrestrial Ecology; Unit of Experimental Cartography;
Unit of Invertebrate Virology.
The NERC also maintains a research vessel base. Grant-aided institutes are:
Freshwater Biological Association; Marine Biological Association; Scottish
Marine Biological Association; Marine Invertebrate Biology Unit; and other
smaller units attached to universities.
A Ship and Marine Technology Requirements Board to identify customer
requirements for research and development in exploiting the resources of the
sea and seabed and in formulating government programmes was set up in 1972
to replace the Advisory Committee on Marine Technology.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was established under Royal
Charter in 1965 to encourage, support and to carry out research in, and to
disseminate knowledge about, the social sciences. The Council consists of a
chairman and 13-19 other members, and is supported by grant-in-aid provided
by Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education and Science. It
provides grants for research projects at universities and other institutions, and
makes training awards to postgraduate students. It has also set up three
research units: the Industrial Relations RU, the Ethnic Relations RU, and
the Survey Unit. The SSRC’s fields of interest include economics; political
science; psychology; social anthropology; social and economic statistics;
sociology and social administration; social science and government; education;
management and industrial relations; human geography; planning and various
aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large
research unit (see p. no) carrying out a wide variety of sociological studies.
The Social Survey conducts sample survey inquiries at the request of govern¬
ment departments and from time to time also carries out studies in collabora¬
tion with universities and other independent research organisations.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500
acres was opened in 1931 at Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society.
Among other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester,

Dudley, and Chessington, Surrey. There are also a number of ‘safari parks’
containing reservations of wild animals through which the public can pass in
closed motor cars.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the Common¬
wealth for the general study of natural history, particularly for research into
classification (taxonomy); it has extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science
Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all
countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held a leading place in
engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the develop¬
ment of industrial machinery and processes. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and
the Geological Survey has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological
Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington, London. Other
important collections are those of the Museum of Science and Industry, in
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume of
information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication, in
which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still
the main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned
societies have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific
information.
A description of general library services which also cater for scientific needs is
given on p. 426. Two constituents of the British Library (see p. 426) are
concerned with science and technology—the Lending Division, and the
Science Reference Library.
The Lending Division collects for loan purposes all literature which is
likely to be of interest to the practising scientist and technologist, covering all
branches of science and technology (including agriculture and medicine) and
the social sciences.
The Science Reference Library is divided between the Holborn Division,
formerly the Patent Office Library, and the Bayswater Branch which has
substantial collections, especially in the life sciences and scientific literature
written in Slavonic and oriental languages.
The rehousing in a new London headquarters of the world’s largest library
devoted to the social sciences—the British Library of Political and Economic
Science, part of the London School of Economics—is planned for completion
in 1976.
Aslib, representing special libraries and information units in industry,
government departments, universities, colleges and other institutions, carries
out research into the collection, utilisation and dissemination of information,
provides consultancy and advisory services and training courses and offers
members an inquiry and reference service covering all subjects.
The Department of Industry and the AEA devote considerable sums to
advisory and information services. The former has nine regional offices which
make contacts with local industries to promote greater use of existing scientific
and technical knowledge. The industrial research associations circulate re¬
search reports and provide information services to members. Besides informa¬
tion services provided by its various groups, which include the Ceramics

Centre and the Non-destructive Testing Centre at Harwell, the AEA has an
information centre at its London headquarters, and a network of regional
advisers on the use of radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux (see
p. 412) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches of
agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in
Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports.
The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results
directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) is an independent
public corporation supported as necessary by government loans through the
Department of Industry. Set up under the Development of Inventions Act
1948 its borrowing power for government advances is ^50 million. Outstanding
advances total £20 million but the corporation is currently funding its annual
investment in research and development from its income from licences and
levies.
The NRDC’s functions are to promote the adoption by industry of new
products and processes invented in government laboratories, universities and
elsewhere, advancing money where necessary to bring them to a commercially
viable stage, and to speed up technological advance by investing money with
industrial firms, on a joint venture basis, for the development of their own
inventions and projects.
Projects so far sponsored include the Cephalosporin C antibiotic, hovercraft,
computers, advanced types of electric motor, oceanology, insecticides, micro¬
electronics and plastics.
Britain is represented on the Scientific and Technical Research Committee
(CREST) of the European Community, set up in 1974, the object of which is
to co-ordinate national policies on these matters and to implement joint
projects of interest to the Community. Other inter-governmental organisations
involved in scientific co-operation with which Britain is concerned include:
specialised agencies of the United Nations, for example, the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World
Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO),
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); the European Nuclear
Energy Agency (ENEA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD); the European Organisation for Nuclear Research
(CERN); the European Space Agency; the European Molecular Biology
Conference; and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
In nuclear energy Britain also co-operates within the framework of inter¬
national agreements; through direct links between the AEA and its counter¬
parts; and through joint companies in, for example, nuclear fuel and radio¬
isotope manufacture. Britain is also represented on the two scientific
committees of the OECD. In areas of non-governmental collaboration,
Britain’s main representative is the Royal Society.
The Ministry of Overseas Development promotes scientific activities in the
interests of developing countries. These include research covering a wide
range of disciplines, specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, conferences
412 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in universities
and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and
providing support for existing research services and research projects overseas.
Equipment is sometimes provided for research purposes and to encourage
scientific training. There are three organisations forming part of the ministry,
which are wholly engaged on scientific work to assist developing countries.
They are the Tropical Products Institute in London, which aims at improving
the economic viability of the less-developed countries by research into new
uses for tropical plant and animal products; the Centre for Overseas Pest
Research which was formed in London in 1971 out of four existing units
including the former Anti-Locust Research Centre (internationally recognised
as a world centre for locust research since 1931); and the Land Resources
Division which is concerned with all aspects of land resource appraisal. The
ministry provides over £6'^ million a year for scientific activities including
research for the benefit of developing countries.
Commonwealth The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
Agricultural all Commonwealth countries, comprise four institutes and ten bureaux, all
Bureaux of which except one institute are in Britain and each of which is concerned
with a particular branch of agricultural science. They act as clearing houses
for the interchange of information of value to research workers in agricultural
science throughout the Commonwealth and increasingly throughout the world.
Seventeen abstract journals, one primary journal and an index are published
periodically and have a combined annual circulation of about 29,000 copies.
The institutes and bureaux also issue monographs on their own particular
subjects and deal with inquiries received from research workers in all parts of
the Commonwealth. Three of the institutes undertake taxonomic services for
all countries of the Commonwealth and many countries outside it.
Commonwealth The Commonwealth Scientific Committee (CSC) consisting of the heads of
Scientific the national research organisations of Commonwealth countries, formed in
Committee 1958 from the previous Standing Committee set up in 1946, meets biennially.
Operating under the CSC is a consultative sub-committee, membership of
which consists of officials responsible for scientific matters in the Common¬
wealth Missions in London, and representatives from British government
departments, and the Royal Society. There are various specialist committees.
The British The principal aims of the British Council (see p. 161) in the sciences (including
Council agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to assist in curriculum reform
at school level and in the training of teachers of science and mathematics.
Overseas, 50 staff with science or science teaching qualifications assist in
scientific and educational development and in scientific collaboration. Empha¬
sis is placed on facilitating the interchange of scientists and teachers and on the
provision of library and information services related to advances in science and
science education in Britain. Overseas tours are arranged for British specialists
to advise, run courses or discuss matters of common interest, and scientists
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, teacher-training
colleges, education authorities, schools or curriculum reform centres. The
council invites senior overseas specialists to Britain, and makes awards to
postgraduate students; it also administers the programmes of a large number
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
413
of senior specialists and students who travel to Britain under the auspices of
the UN specialised agencies, or under various bilateral technical assistance
schemes, or as private individuals. The council is responsible for administering
grants awarded under the Academic Interchange with Europe Scheme, the
European Academic Links Scheme, the Younger Research Workers Inter¬
change Scheme and the Commonwealth University Interchange Scheme.
In Britain, advisory and information facilities are provided by specialist
departments (and libraries) for education, medicine and science including
science education. The council publishes Higher Education in the United
Kingdom. Other publications include British Medical Bulletin, British Medicine,
a monthly guide to current literature, British Medical Periodicals, a select and
annotated list, British Medical Books for Postgraduates, a select and annotated
list; Science Education Newsletter, which lists facilities for education and train¬
ing in Britain, and Scholarships Abroad which lists awards available to British
postgraduate students wishing to study overseas.
20 The Arts
Government
Support
Arts Councils
In the last three decades there has been a steady growth in popular interest
in the arts. This development—reflected, for example, in the profusion of
amateur dramatic and musical societies, the growth in sales of books and
gramophone records, and the large attendance figures at major art exhibitions
—is largely the result of increased leisure time and improved education in the
arts. Another factor has been the influence of television and radio which have
made the best in the arts available to people in their own homes.
Artistic activities in Britain receive financial and other support from many
sources. Though some of the arts—for example, painting and literature—
continue to flourish with little outside help, others, notably drama and classical
music, have become more and more reliant on it. Valuable assistance comes
from such private sources as voluntary trusts and commercial concerns, but
since 1945 the Government and local authorities have played an increasingly
important part in encouraging the arts.
The Government is concerned with the preservation of the country’s cultural
heritage, the promotion of education in the arts, the dissemination of the arts to
a wider public and the encouragement of high standards in the performing
and creative arts. In Great Britain ministerial responsibility for the arts is
borne by a Parliamentary Under Secretary at the Department of Education
and Science; the Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland are also concerned
with cultural matters in Wales and Scotland.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain is £527
million in 1974-75. Direct allocations include j£i8-8 million for the Arts
Council of Great Britain and about ^9*8 million for museums and galleries.
The Government also finances the British Library (see p. 426); in addition it
is responsible through the Department of the Environment, Scottish and
Welsh Offices for the upkeep of ancient monuments and historic buildings and
offers financial help to independent bodies concerned with preservation, such
as the National Trust.
In Britain the main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out
through the education departments. They are concerned, in partnership with
local education authorities and voluntary bodies, with art education in schools,
colleges of further education, evening institutes and community centres, and
with the public library service.
Most government support for the creative arts takes the form of grants to
independent agencies. The most important of these is the Arts Council of
Great Britain, established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main objects are
to develop and improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts,
to increase their accessibility to the public, and to advise and co-operate with
government departments, local authorities and other organisations. The
council promotes music and drama through grants to professional orchestras
and opera, dance and theatre companies, and arranges art exhibitions in
London and the regions. Tours by opera, dance and theatre companies are
organised by the council. A limited amount of assistance is given to individual
artists, including painters, sculptors, photographers, writers and composers,

for particular projects; and the construction of new buildings or improvements
to existing theatres, concert halls and other arts buildings is encouraged by
grants provided under the council’s ‘Housing the Arts’ scheme. The council
also sponsors films on art.
Members of the council are appointed by the minister responsible for the
arts. Advised by panels responsible for different aspects of the arts, the council
itself allocates grants to the main artistic bodies in England, but a growing
proportion of its funds is now channelled to regional arts associations (see p.
416) which allocate funds independently. Organisations in Scotland and
Wales receive their grants from the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils; these
are committees of the Arts Council of Great Britain which allocates to them a
part of its funds.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with similar aims
and functions to that of Great Britain. It receives an annual grant from the
Northern Ireland Department of Education.
The Government promotes knowledge of English literature and culture over¬
seas mainly through the British Council (see footnote, p. 161), which supports
some 177 libraries of books and records in over 70 countries. The British
Council also sponsors overseas tours by leading British actors, producers,
theatre companies, musicians, orchestras and opera and ballet companies; it
promotes exhibitions and lectures overseas on the fine arts in Britain and
organises British participation in international exhibitions; and it distributes
overseas a wide range of specialised films, many of them on the arts.
A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by the
independent television programme companies and the Independent Broad¬
casting Authority (IBA). The BBC spends some £3 million each year in copy¬
right payments to authors and composers and has orchestras employing about
a third of the country’s full-time professional musicians. Each week it broad¬
casts nearly 100 hours of serious music—both live and recorded—on its Radio 3
channel. It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British com¬
posers, and sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. Both the BBC and
IBA broadcast a wide range of new drama together with adaptations of novels
and stage plays; they also screen a variety of feature films including selections
of the best British and overseas productions.
Independent television companies make grants for the promotion of the arts
in their regions and the IBA transmits general magazine programmes on the
arts.
Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their responsi¬
bilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities have power to incur expenditure on entertain¬
ment in all its forms (including cultural activities). Many authorities make
contributions towards the expenses of professional symphony orchestras and
local theatre companies. Grants are often made towards the capital cost of
new arts buildings, especially theatres; the Greater London Council, for
example, is contributing over £4 million towards the cost of the new National
Theatre.
Valuable support for the arts comes from many voluntary sources including
charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters’ organisations of the major
416 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
national institutions. Industrial and commercial concerns provide a certain
amount of patronage, sometimes taking the form of grants to regional arts
associations, local arts festivals and orchestras; some companies sponsor series
of concerts and other cultural events.
The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government,
voluntary bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine.
The Government encourages regional co-operation in arts patronage through
regional arts associations whose aim it is to ensure that the whole range of the
arts is more widely available to people throughout their areas. There are 17 of
these covering most of England and Wales and they channel financial assistance
to local arts organisations and offer an advisory and promotional service for all
sorts of local arts activities. They are financed by a combination of local
authority, Arts Council and private funds; local authorities and a wide range
of other interests are represented on the associations’ committees.
Similar examples of co-operative patronage are the societies formed to
present some of the many arts festivals in Britain. The outstanding example
is the Edinburgh Festival Society, but other festivals organised on a similar
basis include those held in the City of London, Brighton, King’s Lynn,
Norwich and York.
DRAMA Britain is one of the world’s major centres of theatrical activity. In London
during the summer season, theatres are packed with foreign visitors, while in
the provinces there is enthusiastic support for the work of local repertory
companies. A recent development in the theatre—particularly in London—
has been the emergence of ‘fringe’ theatre groups presenting short plays in an
informal atmosphere.
A large part of this development of British drama stems from the growing
government support provided through the Arts Councils of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland which grant subsidies to drama companies registered
as charities (that is, are non-profit distributing), provided that such companies
have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of
practical competence. The Arts Council assists new drama by offering guaran¬
tees to managements giving the first professional production of selected new
plays; and promising authors may be awarded bursaries. Schemes are also in
operation to train stage designers, directors, technicians and those wishing to
take up theatre administration.
Professional There are over 270 theatres in professional use in Britain. Some are owned or
Theatre rented by non-profit-distributing companies, the majority of which are re¬
ceiving Arts Council subsidies while the remainder are operated commercially
or are owned by local authorities.
The centre of theatrical activity is in London where there are some 40
principal theatres in or near the West End and another 15 in the suburbs.
Most of the theatres are let to producing managements on a commercial basis
for each production, but four are occupied by important subsidised companies,
including the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare companies. The
former, which will move into its new building on the South Bank during 1975,
stages classical and modern plays from all countries; the latter presents
Shakespearean plays in Stratford-upon-Avon and a mixed repertoire in
London.
Outside London there are a number of theatres, which accommodate pre-
and post-West End tours of the major London productions and performances

by companies specially formed for touring. These theatres have been declining
in numbers, and several have now been purchased by local authorities. Many
non-repertory theatres outside London present all kinds of drama and many
also put on variety shows and other entertainments. There has, however, been
a growth in the activities of some 60 repertory companies, which receive
financial support from the Arts Council and the local authorities. The reper¬
tory companies employ many leading producers, designers and actors, and
standards are high. Some companies have the use of their own theatres, while
others rent from local authorities. Some 20 new repertory theatres have been
built since 1958.
All plays produced in Great Britain are subject to the provisions of the
Theatres Act 1968. There is no censorship, but the Act makes it a criminal
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as
one which tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend
it’. Provision is made in the Act for a defence against a charge of obscenity on
the grounds that the performance is for the public good in the interests of,
for example, drama, opera or literature.
There are several thousands of amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are
encouraged by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four
special organisations—the British Theatre Association, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association
of Ulster Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur drama clubs
and societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the most
important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of
Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and
the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the
Old Vie School in Bristol. In Scotland there is the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama in Glasgow. An increasing number of universities offer
courses in drama.
Theatre for young people has increased in importance in the past 15 years.
In 1970, under the aegis of the National Theatre, the Young Vic was opened
as a theatre for young people and the National Youth Theatre has a permanent
home in London. There are some 20 specialist companies, including the
Unicorn Theatre for Young People, Theatre Centre and the Polka Company,
some of which are supported by the Arts Council. In the provinces about 33
repertory companies provide programmes and engage in other types of theatre
activity for young people. In Northern Ireland a company called Interplay
Theatre, which is sponsored and administered by the Arts Council of Northern
Ireland, works mainly in schools.
In addition it is estimated that there are some 200 amateur youth theatres
in Britain, most of which are supported by local authorities. Many schools and
youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in drama. The London
education service provides special drama centres for young people.
The Arts Council estimates that annual audience attendances for young
people’s theatre performances are about 3 million.
Music in all its forms plays an important role in British cultural life. There is a
wide interest in ‘pop’ music particularly among young people and concerts of
418 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
folk music attract large audiences, while jazz, light music and brass bands
maintain substantial followings. A widespread interest in ‘serious’ music is
reflected in the size of attendances at orchestral concerts and at performances
of opera, ballet and chamber music.
Through the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Government encourages
interest in the various forms of ‘serious’ music. The Council makes grants to a
number of orchestras, soloists, opera and ballet companies, music societies and
festivals. It also provides bursaries and commissions for British composers,
musicians, designers and choreographers.
In Britain many libraries have collections of records and musical scores
which are available on loan to the public. The City of Westminster houses the
Central Music Library which lends to other libraries and to individuals.
Another well-known music collection is the Henry Watson Music Library at
the Manchester Central Library.
Music Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, adjacent to which are
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room which accommodate smaller-
scale performances; the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, where the annual
summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; and the Wigmore Hall, an
important recital centre.
Orchestras The leading British symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the New
Philharmonia, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester),
the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony and the
Scottish National orchestras. The BBC runs a number of orchestras pro¬
viding broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart
Players, the Philomusica of London, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon
Tyne) and the Scottish Baroque Ensemble. Most orchestras (other than those
of the BBC) receive financial aid from the Arts Councils and local authorities
and some also receive assistance from commercial television and business
organisations. In Northern Ireland the Ulster Orchestra receives financial aid
from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
Choral Societies Among the principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral Society,
the Bach Choir, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the New Philhar¬
monia Chorus, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union and the Belfast Philhar¬
monic Society. Certain of these are closely associated with famous orchestras
while others combine with them in major choral works; most choral societies
are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies.
Music Festivals Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 250 years. The famous Edinburgh International Festival
lasts three weeks; other festivals, such as that at King’s Lynn, last a week or
less. Among the better known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales;
the National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year; the
Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British music; and the
Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. An annual international festival of folk song
and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.

Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees
of local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music.
The National Federation of Music Societies, which receives an annual grant
from the Arts Council, assists amateur groups with the cost of engaging pro¬
fessional soloists; over 1,000 music societies are members of the federation.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts
Council. The Royal Opera House has a permanent orchestra which plays for
the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet. The latter has a high international
reputation and makes overseas tours. It also has a regular London season and
performs in the provinces.
Seasons of opera and operetta in English are given by the English National
Opera which plays in the London Coliseum, and makes provincial tours. Its
former home, Sadler’s Wells Theatre, provides a London stage for visiting
opera and dance companies from the provinces and from abroad.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international cast
is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies include
the English Opera Group, which specialises in the performance of works by
British composers, the New Opera Company which has been associated with
the English National Opera and performs at Sadler’s Wells Theatre, Scottish
Opera and the Welsh National Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland
is promoted by the Northern Ireland Opera Trust and the Studio Opera
Group with financial support from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
Britain’s dance companies include London’s Festival Ballet and the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company) and Scottish Ballet. The London
Contemporary Dance Theatre provides regular seasons of modern dance at
The Place in London besides touring extensively. The work of the Patricia
Mulholland Irish Ballet Company in Northern Ireland, which is assisted by
the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, combines traditional music, dancing and
mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music and Trinity College of Music
in London, and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow
are grant-aided. Other leading colleges include the Guildhall School of Music
and Drama in London, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester
and the Birmingham School of Music. The London Opera Centre provides
advanced training courses for student singers and stage managers. The leading
dance schools are the Royal Ballet School, the Rambert School of Ballet and
the London School of Contemporary Dance which, with many private schools,
have played an important part in raising British dance to its present high
standard.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and ballet.
There are frequent concerts for children and the National Youth Orchestra of
Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, the London Schools’
Symphony Orchestra and several county youth orchestras are noted for their
high standard of performance. A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to
the international Jeunesses Musicales, encourages opera, ballet and other per¬
formances for young people. The Royal Ballet sponsors a small group, Ballet
for All, to give lecture-demonstrations to the public and to schools.

In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
over 208,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exami¬
nations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music.
There are some 1,600 cinemas in Great Britain and estimated attendance in
1973 amounted to 142*25 million. British films, actors and creative and tech¬
nical talent are appreciated both at home and abroad, and regularly achieve
success at international film festivals and other events.
The feature film industry is based in the London area where all the main film
studios are centred. Cinema and television films are exported to most countries
in the world. The trade association to which the majority of feature film pro¬
ducers belong is the Film Production Association of Great Britain.
There is no state-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National
Film Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production through
a consortium formed by the corporation and private interests in 1972 and
which operates with funds drawn from the Government and private interests.
There is a levy on cinema admissions which provides a fund to benefit the
makers of eligible British films. Subject to the approval of the Department of
Trade, grants from the levy can be made to the Children’s Film Foundation,
to the British Film Institute for the production of films and to the National
Film School. The remainder of the fund is distributed by a public body—the
British Film Fund Agency—in proportion to a film’s takings, so that the more
successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the fund.
Under legislation dating from 1927 a specified proportion of British films must
be shown in British cinemas each year. For main feature films the quota has
remained at 30 per cent since 1950 and for supporting programmes at 25 per
cent since 1948.
The state takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but before it can
be shown a film must be licensed by a local authority or, in some areas, a
magistrate. In considering the suitability of films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film Censors,
to which most films for public showing are submitted (other than newsreels).
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of
the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the
films offered to the public. The Board, which does not use any written code of
censorship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a
film; very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed
into one of four categories: ‘U’ (suitable to be seen by any person not less than
five years of age); ‘A’ (for persons of not less than five years of age but con¬
taining material that some parents might prefer their children not to see); ‘AA’
(for persons of not less than 14 years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less
than 18 years of age).
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to
1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then,
British documentary technicians have continued to produce high quality
factual films which have won numerous international awards. The British
Industrial and Scientific Film Association promotes the use of films in

industry, science and commerce. The Federation of Specialised Film Associa¬
tions is the trade association of documentary, short, industrial, advertising
and cartoon film makers.
The National Panel for Film Festivals assists in the selection of short films
for British entries to international short film festivals.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films to inform audiences over¬
seas about British life and achievements, including documentary films, tele¬
vision programmes and newsreels; they are produced through the Central
Office of Information (COI), which commissions their production by private
companies.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Tourist Authority and the British Pro¬
ductivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other countries
are available through the COFs Central Film Library and other agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish films
covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant,
and by the Scottish Film Council which also receives a government grant.
The Institute encourages the making and showing of good films. It also
administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film
Archive, runs an annual summer school, and maintains a film library from
which films may be hired, a library of books on the film and an information
service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the British
Universities Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and Tele¬
vision.
The National Film Archive contains about 23,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and about
800,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of the
film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames in London,
has two cinemas showing films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical
interest; it holds a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes
unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the
films shown. Each year it organises a London Film Festival. The British Film
Institute has promoted the development of some 50 regional film theatres on
the lines of the National Film Theatre and may make grants towards their
recurrent and capital costs. In Scotland the Scottish Film Council is responsible
for regional film theatres and administers the Scottish Central Film Library.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
An independent National Film School offering three-year courses for writers,
directors, producers and cameramen began operating in 1971- The school,
which is financed by government grant, has about 70 students. Training in
film production is also given at the London Film School which has 247
students and provides two-year courses.
The Cinematograph Act 1952 provided for the making of regulations by the
Home Secretary to protect the health and welfare of children attending film
shows. Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from the
licensing authority, which may impose conditions. There are about 800
children’s cinema clubs which provide special programmes on Saturday

designed for children.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, winning many international prizes and commissions for major
works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home has
been stimulated by an increasingly lively attitude towards display on the part
of museums and galleries, and by the activities of many institutions, societies,
private galleries and the growing number of local art centres.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of mainten¬
ance and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase
grants for municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of
local education authority art education. The Government is advised on grants
and policy towards museums by the Standing Commission on Museums and
Galleries.
The Government also encourages high standards of industrial design and
craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council and craft organisations.
In addition to direct state assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, maintains its own
collection of contemporary British art, and organises or offers grants or guaran¬
tees towards a variety of touring and other exhibitions. There are also Arts
Council galleries in Edinburgh and Cardiff. It also supports art societies and
independent galleries, and provides commissions and awards for artists. The
Northern Ireland Arts Council owns a gallery in Belfast.
London is a major centre for the international art market: exports and imports
of works of art for the year ended June 1973 were estimated at £49-9 million
and £65-5 million respectively. Certain items are covered by export control:
these are works of art and other antiques over 100 years old and worth more
than £4,000; documentary and photographic material over 70 years old; and
British archaeological material over 100 years old. A licence is required before
such items can be exported but this is granted automatically in the case of
objects imported into Britain within the last 50 years. In other cases the
application for a licence is considered by the Department of Trade, and if
the department’s expert advisers recommend the withholding of a licence, the
matter is referred to the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of
Art; if the committee regards a work to be of national importance it can
advise the government to withhold the export licence for a specified time to
enable a public museum or art gallery to purchase the object at a fair price.
Over 950 museums and art galleries are open to the public in Britain. These
include the major national collections together with a wide variety of munici¬
pally and independently owned institutions.
Of the national museums and art galleries, those in London contain between
them one of the most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeo¬
logical, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within one
city. They are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the
National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial
War Museum, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the

There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum
(including the Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries
of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art). The
National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s Castle
where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed; and in Northern Ireland there is
the national Ulster Museum in Belfast.
Most of the national museums and galleries are administered by trustee
bodies, but the Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the direct
responsibility of the Department of Education and Science, and the Royal
Scottish Museum has a similar relationship with the Scottish Education
Department.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office and the Sir John Soane’s Museum. In
Buckingham Palace there is a small gallery for exhibition of pictures from the
extensive royal collections. Most cities and large towns and many other towns
have a museum devoted to art, archaeology and natural history, usually owned
by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local learned society or privately
by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in museums,
many of them, as in other towns, associated with the universities—for example,
the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in the country,
and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. There are important museums
and art galleries in Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool,
Manchester, Norwich, Reading, Southampton and York. In Northern Ireland
there are notable museums and galleries in or near Belfast (the Ulster Folk
Museum and the Northern Ireland Arts Council Gallery), in Armagh City
and in Londonderry. Many private art collections housed in historic family
mansions, including those in the ownership of the National Trust, are open to
the public.
A function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to
advise the Government on the relationship between national and provincial
institutions. Close relations are fostered by the eight area museum councils
which cover the whole of Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the Govern¬
ment and offer help and advice to museums and galleries in their area.

staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. The association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for profes¬
sional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions organised and sent on tour by the Arts Councils, the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science
Museum and the Art Exhibitions Bureau are a regular feature of many
museums. The Hayward Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the British Museum, the
Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Academy are the main centres for
loan exhibitions; these are also held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the
Camden Arts Centre and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. The Greater
424 BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London Council exhibits modern sculpture in its parks periodically. Com¬
mercial exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held through¬
out the year in the galleries of the art dealers of London (largely in the Bond
Street area).
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. The Royal Scottish Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh.
An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local
exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also
exhibitions of children’s art, including the National Exhibition of Children’s
Art sponsored annually by the Sunday Mirror.
Finance All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides
meeting the administrative and maintenance costs, the Government makes
provision for annual purchase grants which totalled £i-6 million in 1974-75.
It also provides special ad hoc purchase grants, and pre-eminent works of art
accepted by the Government in lieu of estate duty are allocated to public
collections.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or endow¬
ments, can be helped in building up their collections through the annual
government grant administered by the Victoria and Albert, Science and Royal
Scottish Museums. Financial help and practical assistance is also given to
museums and galleries by certain trusts and voluntary bodies, particularly
the National Art-Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society.
Art Education Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, colleges of
further education and polytechnics, which are administered by local education
authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include univer¬
sities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At post¬
graduate level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own degrees.
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art)
Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department. University
art schools include the Slade School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths’ College
(London), the Ruskin Drawing School (Oxford), the Reading School of Art,
the Department of Fine Art of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and
the School of Art of University College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Depart¬
ment of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and
the Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland three-year full-time degree courses
and some four-year sandwich courses are available to students who have
successfully completed a foundation course or have been exempted from it.
Postgraduate courses are available at some institutions. In Scotland each of the
four schools of art awards a diploma which is roughly equivalent to the pass
degree of a university and three award associateships, which are comparable
with an honours degree. The Ulster College (see p. 159) is the regional college
for Northern Ireland.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among other activities, encourages the purchase by
schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools
exhibition. Pictures may also be borrowed from an increasing number of
public libraries.

LITERATURE
AND LIBRARIES
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past (for preservation, see p. 171).
Several government departments are concerned with architecture and help
to promote good design. The Department of the Environment is responsible
for the design, building and maintenance work of government departments
and undertakes research and development work in these subjects. It also
provides advice to local authorities in England and Wales on the best standards
of housing design through a series of Design Bulletins and other publications
and offers annual awards for the best housing designs in both public and
private sectors. Other government departments, such as the Department of
Education and Science and the Department of Health and Social Security,
provide design advice and exercise design control over buildings—such as
schools and hospitals—falling within their area of responsibility.
Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance, including new building developments.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture, and the Civic Trust (see p. 167)
seeks to promote high standards in architecture and civic planning and to
encourage interest in the appearance and protection of town and countryside.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of ‘architect’
unless registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. Most students train at a full-time school of architecture; there are
33 schools recognised for exemption from the examination in architecture of
the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Some of these schools have
part-time courses and there are five other schools which have courses leading
to the RIBA external examination.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional archi¬
tectural institution with a membership of over 21,000 in Britain and 5>500
overseas and over 3,600 students in Britain and overseas countries. The RIBA
has 72 branches in Britain, and allied to it are 33 architectural societies in
overseas countries. It is concerned with a wide range of activities covering pro¬
fessional practice, science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions,
and professional and public relations; arranges lectures and discussions on a
variety of subjects; presents exhibitions; and, through its Board of Education,
exercises control over standards of architectural education. The RIBA has one
of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world. Among
other associations are the Incorporated Association of Architects and Sur¬
veyors, the Institute of Registered Architects and the Faculty of Architects
and Surveyors. Societies include the Architectural Association, the Archi¬
tecture Club, and several which cover particular aspects of architecture, such
as the Modular Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges
and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private
libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews are
featured in the press and on radio and there are numerous periodicals con¬
cerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in
the form of literary prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for
instance, the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry, the Hawthornden prize for

imaginative writing, and the Somerset Maugham award for young writers.
Government help is given through the Arts Council of Great Britain which
supports literature in a number of ways, including grants for writers, transla¬
tors, publishers, little presses and magazines. Similar provision is made through
the Arts Council of Northern Ireland for bursaries, poetry readings, and aid
for publications.
The British Library was created in July 1973 under the British Library Act
1972 from a merger of the British Museum Library with other libraries and
institutions. The Library is organised in three divisions. The Reference
Division includes the Department of Printed Books holding over 7 million
volumes; the Department of Manuscripts; and the Department of Oriental
Manuscripts and Books. The Lending Division at Boston Spa, Yorkshire, has
over 2 million volumes and 43,000 current periodicals available on loan to
other libraries in Britain; it also has access to many millions of books in other
libraries and is the national centre for inter-library lending within Britain and
between Britain and foreign countries. A Bibliographic Services Division is
being formed to include the work of the British National Bibliography which,
is published weekly with three, six, nine and twelve monthly accumulations
listing in a classified order (with indexes) all new books and new editions,
excluding reprints, of books published in Britain. The British Library auto¬
matically receives a copy of each new book published in Britain. In addition
the National Library of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the Bodleian
Library of Oxford University and the Cambridge University Library are
entitled to claim copies.
The Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum (Natural History)
in South Kensington also have large libraries and many government depart¬
ments have old-established libraries of considerable size and importance. The
Public Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of law and of
most government departments, as well as such famous historical documents
as Domesday Book. The National Register of Archives (maintained by the
Historical Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local and private
records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the Signet Library,
Edinburgh, and the London Library, there are the rich resources of the
learned societies and institutions (for scientific societies and institutions, see
p. 399). Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society,
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the British Theatre Association, the Royal
Academy of Music, the National Library for the Blind and the National Book
League.
Educational expansion has increased the strain on library resources at all levels
of education. The ancient university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are
not matched by any of the more recent foundations, although the combined
library resources of the colleges and institutions of the university of London
total about 5 million volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Man¬
chester contains more than 2 million volumes, and the university libraries of
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Birmingham each have over three-quarters of a
million volumes. Many universities have succeeded in building up large and
important research collections in special subjects; for example, the Barnes
Medical Library at Birmingham and the Brotherton Library of English Litera¬
ture at Leeds. The new universities, including the new technological uni-

Associations
versities, are also building collections and substantial libraries are being
assembled in polytechnics and colleges of education.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive important support services from the public library
service, including loans of books. Schoolchildren are regularly introduced to
the public library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
local public library authorities. These libraries have a total stock of some 117
million books. (The figures do not include the libraries in the publicly main¬
tained schools.) Qualified and specialist staff are available for consultation in
all but the smallest service points. About one-third of the total population are
members of public libraries.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 the Secretary of State
for Education and Science is charged with the supervision of the public library
service in England and in Wales, and is advised by two library advisory
councils. Public library authorities in Great Britain have a duty to provide an
efficient and (with some limitations) free lending and reference library service
for books and periodicals. Outlying areas may be served by mobile libraries,
of which over 600 are in service, and domiciliary services exist for people who
are unable to visit a library.
Similar duties are carried out in Northern Ireland by the education and
library boards.
In addition to lending books, about a half of the library authorities now lend
gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding loan
collections of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all library
authorities provide children’s departments, while reference sections and art,
music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields. Most library authorities possess a significant
collection of books and documents on the history of their localities.
The public library is often a centre for local cultural activities. Film shows,
lectures, adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramo¬
phone recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities pro¬
vided by or based upon the local library.
A voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales has grown
up since the first quarter of this century. The eight regional library bureaux
in England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each area) aim
to be largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British books,
achieved in some regions by a system of co-operative subject specialisation.
They organise co-operation among themselves and through the British Library,
which is responsible for interlending at national and international level.
There is a growing number of local schemes for the exchange of specialist
books and periodicals and information. These involve industrial, commercial
and sometimes university libraries and are normally centred on a major public
or technical college library.
The National Library of Scotland carries out functions similar to those of
the regional bureaux and the lending division of the British Library. In
Northern Ireland access to the stocks of all co-operating libraries is available
on application to the Queen’s University and New University of Ulster
libraries and to the five education and library boards.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which,
among other functions, holds examinations in librarianship. The Association
428

Societies
BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in September 1974 had a personal membership of 21,495 whom more than
2,023 were from overseas countries. It maintains a Register of Chartered
Libarians, publishes books, pamphlets and official journals, and holds regular
conferences. There are also associations of libraries, for example the Associa¬
tion of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (see p. 410).
In 1973 British publishers issued 35,254 separate titles including 9,556 reprints
and new editions. I he total of new titles issued was 25,698. An increasing
proportion of books—including a wide range of specialised non-fiction—is
now sold in paper-back form; Penguin Books are the best known publishers
of paper-backs. Book clubs make available hard-backed books at a lower price.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers Association. The British Council also publicises British books and
periodicals through libraries in over 70 countries, its programmes of book
exhibitions and its bibliographical publications. The Book Development
Council promotes British books overseas. (For sales and exports of books in
x973, see p. 239.) The National Book League has a membership covering all
who are interested in books; authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and
readers. It encourages an interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain
and overseas.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies, generally known as the
British Academy, is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a
grant from the Treasury.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals; the Poetry
Society and the Apollo Society are among the best known. Poetry also plays
an important part in various annual festivals, including the National Eisteddfod
the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-Avon Festival of
Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the annual poetry festival
organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
21 The Press
Ownership
The British press caters for a variety of political views, different levels of
education and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to state control or
censorship.
A large number of newspapers are sold in Britain every day, and although
there are relatively few national newspapers, some of them have circulations
comparable with the greatest in any other part of the world; individual audited
circulation figures range from nearly 200,000 to nearly 4-2 million.
The national newspapers (daily and Sunday) fall into two categories: popu¬
lar and quality. The tabloid format is more commonly used by the former and
the broadsheet format by the latter. Prices range from £0-04 to £0-08 for
dailies and from £0-05 to £0-12 for Sundays. Separate sections or pages on
finance, business, industry, education, the arts, social services and sport are
common, and some papers carry special supplements on particular subjects,
with related advertising. The quality Sunday newspapers have separate
sections for literature and the arts, business and industry, as well as colour
magazine supplements. Free colour magazine supplements are published by
one morning and two Sunday newspapers: the Daily Telegraph, the Sunday
Times and The Observer.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory1 132 daily and Sunday news¬
papers and some 1,158 weekly newspapers are published in Britain. These
figures include certain specialised papers, the circulation of which is limited
not by region, but by interest; for instance, business newspapers, sporting
newspapers, newspapers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other
countries resident in Britain and religious newspapers.
Britain imports three-quarters of its newsprint requirements, over i-2
million tonnes annually, while the rest is made mainly from imported raw
materials.
Newspaper ownership in Britain, as it affects the national daily and Sunday,
London evening and regional daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the
hands of a comparatively small number of large press publishing groups.
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The seven major newspaper
and periodical publishers are: International Publishing Corporation Limited
(part of Reed International); Associated Newspapers Limited; Beaverbrook
Newspapers Limited; the Thomson Organisation Limited; News Inter¬
national Limited; United Newspapers Limited; and Pearson Longman
Limited.
The large national newspaper and periodical publishers are major corpora¬
tions with diversified interests over the whole field of publishing and com¬
munications ; some have shares in independent television and radio contracting
companies. The Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 establishes
the right of local newspapers to hold shares in companies providing local
independent radio services (see p. 442).
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the 1974
edition of The Newspaper Press Directory.

BRITAIN 1975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Although pronounced views may be expressed in some newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
political party and are not obliged to follow any specific party line.1 In order to
preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers and periodicals are
governed by arrangements which vest ownership of the undertaking in trustees,
or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide that the transfer
of shares be controlled by trustees. Others have management arrangements
intended to ensure the authority and independence of editors.
Safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentration of the means
of communication are provided in certain Acts of Parliament, for instance, in
the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973, which stipulates that, if it
appears to the Independent Broadcasting Authority at any time that news¬
paper shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are
leading to results which are contrary to the public interest, the Authority may,
with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the companies that their
programmes may cease to be transmitted. The Act makes a similar stipulation
for local independent radio and provides that if a local newspaper has a
monopoly in the area, it should not be allowed to have a controlling interest
in the local radio station. In addition the Fair Trading Act 1973 makes
unlawful any transfer of a newspaper or newspaper assets to a newspaper
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting,
with that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies unless
the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection gives written
consent. Except in certain limited cases, which include transfers of very small
newspapers, consent may be given only after the Secretary of State has re¬
ferred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and received
their report.
Nine morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the
British Isles, and there are seven national Sunday papers (see Table 39). All
the national dailies are produced in London, but those with big circulations
also print northern editions in Manchester. The Scottish Daily Express is also
printed in Manchester. The leading Scottish papers {The Scotsman and The
Glasgow Herald) have a considerable circulation outside Scotland. Each of the
(two) London evening papers has ownership affiliations with a national daily,
but both have their distinctive style and draw their readership very largely
from people living in and around London.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, 86 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and over 700 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. Some of the daily newspapers also
give extensive coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide
their own foreign news service. The leading regional newspapers have wide
regional circulations; a few have nation-wide reputations.
Generally speaking, regional evening newspapers are non-political, while
the morning newspapers are independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is esti¬
mated at about 5 million. Of the morning papers the Journal (Newcastle upon
Tyne), the Yorkshire Post (Leeds) and the Northern Echo (Darlington) have
circulations of over 100,000 and two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday

Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—have
circulations of over 200,000. Individual circulation figures of regional evening
papers start at about 1,700; most are in the 30,000-100,000 range; a few have
circulations of over 300,000. Weekly papers are mainly of local appeal; they
are also a valuable medium for local advertising. Most have circulations in the
5,000-40,000 range.
There are also a number of free distribution newspapers (mostly weekly),
some of which are published by orthodox newspaper publishers.
The London local weeklies (155) include papers for every district in Greater
London. They are assembled mainly in groups of six to eight, affiliated in some
cases to larger groups.
A number of evening newspapers, using the latest production technology,
are published in the outer metropolitan area on the fringe of the circulation
areas of the two London evening newspapers.
Scotland has five morning, six evening and two Sunday newspapers, in
addition to the Scottish editions of the Daily Express and Sunday Express. The
leading morning papers are The Scotsman, published in Edinburgh, and The
Glasgow Herald. Others are: the Daily Record, published in Glasgow; the
Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee; and the Press and Journal of
Aberdeen. Evening papers include the Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s
Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening
Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday
papers are the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Post.
Weekly and local newspapers published in Scotland number about 130. The
most widely known are the People's Journal, which has several local editions,
and the Weekly News.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast: they are The News-Letter (Unionist)
and the Irish News (Nationalist), the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday
News. There are 42 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, with circulations
ranging from about 4,500 to about 24,000. The majority are published by
individual companies.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; it circulates mainly in southern Wales. In North Wales the Liverpool
Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers pub¬
lished in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Argus,
Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North Wales is served
by the Liverpool Echo and to a smaller extent by the Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (over 70 papers) includes English language papers, some
of which carry articles in Welsh, and Welsh language papers.
The Channel Islands have two daily (evening) papers (one in Guernsey and
one in Jersey) and two weeklies, which also circulate in Alderney and Sark.
In the Isle of Man there are five weekly newspapers of which the Isle of
Man Examiner has the largest circulation.
There are over 4,330 periodical publications in Britain, classified as ‘general’,
‘specialised’, ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also some 660
‘house magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or
public services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients.
THE PRESS
433
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other associations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales in Britain are: Woman',
Woman's Weekly', Woman's Own', Weekend’, Woman's Realm', Radio Times',
and TV Times. The leading journals of opinion are The Economist, a politically
independent publication covering topics from a wider angle than its title
implies; the New Statesman, which is a review of politics, literature and the
arts with an independent socialist political tendency; the Spectator, which
covers much the same subjects from an independent conservative standpoint;
Tribune, which represents the views of the left-wing of the Labour Party; New
Society, which covers the sociological aspects of current affairs; and New
Scientist, which reports on the progress of science and technology in terms
which the non-specialist can understand. Punch, traditionally the leading
humorous periodical, also devotes attention to public affairs.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious type of reader.
The publication of trade, technical, business, scientific and professional
journals (covering hundreds of subjects, many of them in considerable depth)
has become one of the more important aspects of the British publishing
industiy. In addition to circulating in Britain, these journals have a con¬
siderable circulation outside Britain and are an important medium for selling
British goods overseas. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to
quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout the United Kingdom.
Weekly papers are also published in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland:
in Wales several monthly and quarterly journals in both Welsh and English;
in Scotland four monthly illustrated periodicals (Scottish Field, Scotland's
Magazine, Scots Magazine and Scotland), a weekly paper devoted to farming
interests (Scottish Farmer), a number of literary journals, of which the most
famous is probably Blackwood's, and numerous popular magazines; and in
Northern Ireland weekly, monthly and quarterly publications covering farm¬
ing, the linen industry, building, motoring, politics and social work.
News Agencies There are three principal British news agencies: Reuters Ltd.; the Press
Association Ltd.; and the Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd. is an international news organisation owned by the newspapers
of Britain, Australia and New Zealand through the Newspaper Publishers
Association, the Press Association, the Australian Associated Press and the
New Zealand Press Association, which are parties to a trust agreement to
safeguard the independence and integrity of the news service. Founded in
Aachen in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851, Reuters now has about
1,000 correspondents in 183 countries and territories, and links with 120
national or private news agencies, which give it access to coverage by many
thousands of local reporters. Some 600,000 to 700,000 words of general news,
sports, and economic services reports are received in London every day over
a global network of leased cable and radio circuits. From these messages
regionalised news services, specially tailored to the needs of recipients in

Britain and eight main overseas regions, are transmitted to more than 150
countries for distribution to information media, either direct or through
national news agencies. Reuters Economic Services supply up-to-the-minute
information to business houses throughout the world. Its computerised
systems offer virtually instant coverage of the important stock and com¬
modity markets by computer interrogation or video display. A computerised
message-handling system, known as the Automatic Data Exchange, is used
to speed up the handling and distribution of news.
The Press Association Ltd., the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and of the Irish Republic. It provides newspapers,
the broadcasting organisations, Reuters (of which it is a major joint owner)
and other international agencies with a complete service of home news, includ¬
ing general and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of financial,
commercial and sports news; and includes in its services to regional papers the
world news of Reuters and the Associated Press. News is teleprinted 24 hours
a day from head office in Fleet Street over a network of lines leased from the
Post Office—certain items being available in teletypesetting form.
Through its Photographic Department the Press Association serves London
and regional newspapers with a daily picture service from home and overseas;
these are wired to the regional press. Its Special Reporting Service supplies
reports of local or special interest to daily and weekly papers and periodicals.
All profits are used to develop the service.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a public company with over 1,100 shareholders,
which supplies financial and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting
organisations. Racing services are also supplied by teleprinter and telephone
to subscribers in London and the provinces from offices in all important cities
and towns.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Asso¬
ciated Press Ltd., and by United Press International, which are British
subsidiaries of United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some countries,
but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The Printing and Publishing Industry Training Board (PPITB) is responsible
for training in the printing, publishing and professional photography indus¬
tries. The responsibilities of the board (which has a chairman, a deputy chair¬
man and 23 other members, representing employer, employee and educational
interests) include the formulation of training schemes, the establishment of
standards, ensuring that adequate facilities exist, and the provision of a
regional advisory service.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), composed of
the major representative organisations in journalism and the press, works in
partnership with the Board. Its functions include superintending activities
concerning entry into journalism, setting and conducting examinations; and
organising short training courses and seminars for journalists.
There are two normal methods of entry to newspaper journalism: (1) by
selection for a place on a full-time course lasting for one academic year and
(2) by direct recruitment to a regional or local newspaper. Students selected
THE PRESS
435
for a pre-entry course must have gained two passes at the Advanced level of the
General Certificate of Education (GCE) and be under the age of 20 at the
beginning of a course. Some pre-entry students are sponsored by newspapers;
the others are assisted by the NCTJ to find employment on completion of the
course. The minimum educational requirement for direct entry is five GCE
passes at Ordinary level.
Under collective agreements between the employers’ associations in pub¬
lishing and the National Union of Journalists, systematic training under
NCTJ arrangements is obligatory for all entrants to the regional and local
newspaper publishing sector under the age of 31. The scheme consists of
on-the-job training, and block-release courses for those who have not attended
a pre-entry course. A similar syllabus covering practical journalism, shorthand,
use of language, law, public administration and current affairs is used at both
kinds of course. Eight centres (five in England, and one each in Wales, Scot¬
land and Northern Ireland) provide courses for reporters and there is one
centre for newspaper photographers.
All entrants to regional and local newspapers who are under the age of 24
serve an apprenticeship of three years (two years in the case of graduates).
For direct entrants apprenticeship follows six months’ probation. Entrants
from pre-entry courses serve three months’ probation, after which apprentice¬
ship is back-dated to the start of the probation period. After minimum qualify¬
ing service under NCTJ regulations trainees take a proficiency test which
carries a salary bonus.
Both the PPITB and the NCTJ have given attention to the development of
comparable arrangements for entrants to periodical publishing. NCTJ
accredited courses (including pre-entry) are available in central London
(where the greater part of the periodical publishing sector is situated) and the
PPITB has drawn up a recommendation on systematic training for the editorial
staff of periodicals to facilitate the preparation of in-company schemes
which now exist in most major groups. The NCTJ courses are arranged in
association with the London College of Printing and include a one-year pre¬
entry course in periodical journalism, and evening, day release, and occasional
block release courses.
While most training in journalism in Britain takes place at below university
level and there are no courses offering degrees in journalism, the Centre for
Journalism Studies at the University College, Cardiff, has a one-year post¬
graduate diploma course in journalism which is available to any holder of a
degree from a British university or a recognised equivalent. The University of
Warwick provides a management course for newspaper executives in con¬
junction with the Newspaper Publishers Association. In addition a wide range
of training courses, covering circulation, advertising, industrial relations and
supervisory management are provided for the regional newspaper industry by
the Newspaper Society Training Service and for the national newspapers by the
Newspaper Publishers Association. Short general management courses are also
run in conjunction with the University of Aston in Birmingham.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Travelling Fellowship Scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, about ten journalists from overseas spend four months in the United
Kingdom each year, partly in the offices of newspapers or periodicals and
partly acquiring a general idea of life in Britain. A limited number of travelling
scholarships are also awarded to British journalists to enable them to visit
Commonwealth countries overseas.
The Thomson Foundation offers scholarships and organises training courses

for journalists from all parts of the world at its Editorial Studies Centre in
Cardiff, and provides consultants and tutors for courses for journalists overseas.
The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the regional, local and London surburban press; the Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday news¬
papers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which
represents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines. On the journalists’ side there are the
Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Association of
Journalists, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907.
All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio, television, public
relations and freelance journalism) are eligible for membership of either of
these organisations. The NUJ has 28,000 members and the loj about 2,000.
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain the
dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors,
to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the education
and training of journalists: the Guild has about 400 members. The British
Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to which most
editors of house journals belong.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 30 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in ac¬
cordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to
report on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions
to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic reports recording its work,
and to review from time to time developments in the British press and the
factors affecting them. The council publishes annual reports, which include
statistics of the newspaper and periodical press and a series of articles examin¬
ing the structure of the leading press groups.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law; in general, it is at liberty
to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers for postal purposes,
there are no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which
apply, in particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the
transfer of newspaper assets; restrictions on reporting of preliminary hear¬
ings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland); the
right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local authorities;
restrictions on the publication of (a) divorce and domestic proceedings in
THE PRESS
437
courts of law, (b) advertisement and investment circulars, which are governed
by Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading descriptions of
goods and services and with fraud and (c) advertisements of remedies for
certain diseases, which are covered by public health legislation; agreements
between the Post Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communica¬
tions, which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain
types of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
The press is also affected by the Trade Descriptions Act which imposes
penalties for false or misleading descriptions of goods or services.
Of particular relevance to the work of the press are the laws on libel,
defamation and contempt of court. A newspaper may not publish comments
on the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice their
reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings nor may it
publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence the
result. The obtaining and publication of information from state and official
sources of a confidential or security nature is affected by the Official Secrets
Acts. Newspapers are also liable to proceedings for seditious libel and incite¬
ment to disaffection.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.

Broadcasting
Broadcasting by television and radio in Britain is regulated by the Home
Secretary under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1949 and 1967, which prohibit
the sending or receiving of wireless communications, except under licence.
Two public bodies—the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)—are licensed to provide television
and radio broadcasting services.1 The BBC, which was established by Royal
Charter in 1927, operates two national television services, four national radio
services and 20 local radio stations; it also broadcasts to countries abroad
through its external services division. The IBA, originally established in 1954
as the Independent Television Authority, controls the operation of the single
independent television service and has similar responsibility for a network of
independent local radio stations which is being established (see p. 442).
Users of television sets must obtain a receiving licence each year, which can
be bought from most post offices. Licences for sets receiving black and white
pictures cost £7 a year, and for those receiving colour pictures £12 a year.
There were nearly 17*4 million receiving licences current in Britain in June
1974 of which some 11*5 million were for black and white, and nearly 5-9
million for colour television.
Both the BBC and the IBA are constitutionally required to provide a ‘public
service’ with the purpose of disseminating information, education and
entertainment. The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by
the new Royal Charter granted in 1964 and by the Licence and Agreement of
1969, and those of the IBA by the Independent Broadcasting Authority Acts
1973 and 1974 and its 1973 Licence.
The BBC and the IBA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Home Secretary is
answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy and may issue directions
to the BBC and the IBA on a number of technical and other subjects. Both
organisations are expected to show balance and due impartiality in their
general presentation of programmes, particularly where matters of public
policy or controversial subjects are concerned, and in this connection the
Home Secretary has powers to prohibit the broadcasting of any particular
item or class of item, or to revoke the licences of the BBC or IBA at any time.
These are treated as major reserve powers and no formal veto has ever been
placed on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the IBA
are required to publish annual reports and accounts.
The Corporation consists of 12 governors (including a chairman, a vice-
chairman and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland), each appointed for a period of not more than five years by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. The governors are constitutionally
responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation, including
the production and presentation of the programmes on television and radio,
1 In 1974 a committee of inquiry was appointed by the Government to look into the
future of broadcasting.

and the provision and working of the necessary installations and equipment.
A number of committees advise them on such matters as the social effects of
television, religious broadcasting, music, agriculture, school broadcasting,
further education, programmes for immigrants, science and engineering and
charitable appeals. The governors appoint the chief executive officer of the
BBC—the Director General—with whom they discuss all major matters of
policy and finance. He is chairman of the BBC’s board of management, which
also includes his chief assistant, the managing directors for television, radio
and external broadcasting, the directors of programmes for television and
radio, and the directors of personnel, finance, public affairs and engineering.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily
for reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative
of the local community, are appointed by the BBC to advise on the develop¬
ment and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by an annual
grant voted by Parliament (£140-8 million in 1973-74) which is the income from
the sale of television receiving licences less certain deductions for collection
and other expenses. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities,
including domestic sales of magazines and other publications dealing with
BBC radio and television programmes, and overseas sales of programmes.
Nearly three-quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on domestic services relates
to television. The BBC meets the cost of local radio stations but some local
education authorities have assisted in the making of educational programmes.
The BBC’s external services are financed by a grant determined each year
by the Government; in 1973-74 this amounted to over £16 million.
The Independent Broadcasting Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and nine other members (three of whom have responsibility for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) appointed by the Home Secretary.
The IB A does not itself produce programmes; these are provided by com¬
mercial programme companies. The authority’s four main functions are to
appoint the programme companies, to control the programme output, to
control the advertising and to build, own and operate the transmitting stations
for the independent television and radio networks.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broad¬
casting, religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist
panel advises on medical and allied advertisements. Local advisory committees
provide advice on local radio services.
The chief executive officer of the IBA is the Director General. There are
also two deputy directors general, and a headquarters and regional office staff
covering all technical and administrative services.
The IBA receives no payments from licence revenue; the finance for its
operations is drawn from annual rental payments made to it by the television
and radio programme companies which amounted to about £13-7 million in
the year ended March 1974. The television programme companies also pay
to the IBA for transfer to the Exchequer a further sum known as the levy.
Previously related to advertising revenue, the levy has, since June 1974, been
related to the profits of the programme companies.
Fifteen television programme companies hold six-year contracts to provide
television programmes in the 14 independent television regions of Britain (two
companies share the contract for London, one providing programmes during
440
Control by

the week and the other at the weekend). The companies operate on a commer¬
cial basis, deriving their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue, and programme production of the companies
vary considerably, depending largely on the size of population in their areas.
(Independent Television serves a population of some 14 million people in the
London area compared with some 107,000 people in the Channel Islands.)
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the pro¬
grammes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material produced
by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other programme com¬
panies, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five largest com¬
panies (Thames, ATV, Granada, Yorkshire, and London Weekend) produce a
larger proportion of their own programmes and provide more programmes
for broadcast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller ones.
A common news service is provided by Independent Television News
Limited, a non-profit-making company in which all the programme com¬
panies are shareholders. The negotiations concerning the supply, exchange
and purchase of programmes and their co-ordinated transmission through
the independent television network take place largely on the Network Planning
Committee which consists of representatives of all the programme companies
and of the IBA.
Local broadcasting by independent radio stations has been introduced by
the IBA. The companies providing programmes are under contract to the
IBA, operate under its control and are financed by advertising revenue.
When a company, on the basis of negotiations with the other companies, has
decided on a programme schedule for its area, it is required to submit this to
the IBA for approval. The authority has wide-ranging powers to control and
regulate the content and quality of programmes; for example, it ensures that a
‘proper balance’ of views is expressed and has drawn up a code on violence
stating that special precautions are to be taken when children are likely to be
viewing. There are also safeguards in the Independent Broadcasting Authority
Act 1973 to prevent newspaper shareholdings in a programme company
leading to results contrary to the public interest. However, the IBA believes
that newspapers can bring valuable qualities to the development of television
and radio and is not opposed to investment by them. In certain circumstances
local newspapers have a right to a share in the control of local radio companies.
Television viewing has become by far the most popular recreational activity in
Britain and some 96 per cent of the population now watch television in their
own homes. Average viewing time per head of population in 1972-73 was
over 17 hours a week. There are three television channels: BBC 1 and ITV
which broadcast on both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines
ultra high frequency (uhf), and BBC 2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf
only. Some 99 per cent of the population live within range of vhf, and more
than 94 per cent within range of uhf transmissions. A majority of people own
uhf receivers, and when most of the old vhf-only receivers have been replaced
the vhf broadcasts of BBC 1 and ITV will cease. Colour programmes were
first introduced on BBC 2 in 1967 and were extended to BBC 1 and ITV in
1969 when they began uhf broadcasts. A high proportion of programmes on
the three uhf services are transmitted in colour, though receivable also in
black and white.
Radio attracts its largest audiences during the mornings. In 1972-73 radio
listening averaged some 9 hours a week per head of population.

Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing regular
television broadcasts since 1936. Since 1964 it has operated two services—
BBC 1 and BBC 2. All BBC 2 programmes and the majority of those on BBC 1
are broadcast on the national network. Although many nationally networked
programmes are produced in London some originate from regional studios in
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and eight regional centres in England.
In 1972-73 some 4,944 hours were broadcast on the BBC 1 national network
including 840 hours of programmes produced by regional organisations for
network transmission; similar figures for BBC 2 were 3,080 hours including
309 hours of regional productions. Regional studios also originate programmes
of news and local interest intended for regional transmission only; these varied
from 626 hours in Wales (of which 376 were in the Welsh language) to an
average of over 145 hours in each of the eight English regions.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC 1 presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment,
sport, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while BBC 2 places
greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger element of news,
documentaries, serious drama and music. Programmes successful on BBC 2
are frequently repeated on BBC 1. Both channels provide a wide range of
education programmes; in 1972-73 over 12 per cent of BBC 1 transmissions
were devoted to schools and further education broadcasts and 15*5 per cent of
BBC 2 transmissions to Open University lectures (see p. 156).
During 1972-73 BBC television programmes won 21 international awards
and more than 7,000 screen hours of programmes were sold to more than 90
countries overseas.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in 1955.
ITV transmissions are provided on a regional basis by 15 programme com¬
panies. In 1972-73 over 9,000 hours of different programmes were shown over
the independent television network: 7,300 hours were produced in the com¬
panies’ own studios of which two-thirds were programmes designed for
regional audiences (including news and magazine programmes) and the re¬
mainder were nationally networked. About 1,200 hours consisted mainly of
programmes imported from overseas for showing largely on the national
network.
ITV programmes cover the whole range of television output, and more than
one-third of viewing time is devoted to serious programmes such as news and
news magazines, current affairs and documentaries, religion and education.
The remainder includes a high proportion of drama (often in serial form),
light entertainment, music, sport and feature films. There are about three
short advertising intervals an hour, in and between programmes.
BBC Radio provides listeners with four alternative national channels, each of
which has a distinct character. Radio 1, broadcasting some 12 hours a day,
provides a programme of ‘pop’ music, while Radio 2, broadcasting over 20
hours a day, provides light music as well as being the principal channel for
the coverage of sport. Radio 3, broadcasting some 17 hours a day, provides
continuous, mainly classical, music (much of which is in stereo) and in the
evening offers, in addition, adult education programmes and works of artistic
and intellectual interest. Radio 4, broadcasting 17 hours a day, is the main
speech programme, providing the principal news and information service of
442

the BBC; in addition it presents a wide range of drama, talks and entertain¬
ment programmes as well as broadcasts to schools.
Local radio was started by the BBC as an experiment in eight towns in
1967 and there are now 20 stations. Broadcasting on vhf and the medium
waveband, local radio stations provide between 9 and 13 hours of locally
produced programmes each day, normally during the early morning, lunch¬
time and early evening periods. During the rest of the day they transmit
programmes from the BBC’s national networks. Local broadcasts provide a
comprehensive service of local news and information, besides covering local
arts and sports activities and offering residents opportunities to air their views
on subjects of local interest.
Much of the output of the independent local radio stations is popular pro¬
gramming but they are also expected to provide a national and local news
service, information, and programmes on local affairs and community activities.
The first two began broadcasting in London in October 1973; Capital Radio
provides a general entertainment service while a specialist news and informa¬
tion service is broadcast by the London Broadcasting Company whose sub¬
sidiary, Independent Radio News, gives national and international news to
the other independent stations. In December 1973 a third station, Radio
Clyde, began broadcasting in the Glasgow area. Birmingham Broadcasting and
Radio Piccadilly in Manchester began broadcasting in the spring of 1974 and
stations for Tyneside and Wearside, Swansea, Sheffield and Rotherham,
Liverpool and Edinburgh are expected to begin operating at the end of 1974.
The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas. The main objectives of BBC
external broadcasts are to give unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and
to project British life and culture. The BBC broadcasts in 40 languages
(including English) for a total of some 750 hours a week. News bulletins, current
affairs programmes, political commentaries and topical magazine programmes
form the main part of the output. A full service of sports commentaries and
results, all kinds of music, drama and a wide range of general entertainment
programmes are also included.
The languages in which the external services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart
from this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in
determining the content of news and other programmes.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes
designed to be of special interest to Africa and Europe.
The foreign language services are divided into areas, namely, the African,
Arabic, Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa),
Central European, South European, German and East European Services.
Broadcasts range from 70 hours a week in Arabic to half an hour in Nepali.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. Some 280 radio programmes of
English lessons are broadcast weekly with explanations in 27 other languages,
and recorded lessons are supplied to some 200 stations in over 77 countries.
English by Television programmes are shown in more than 50 countries.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through
the BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are some 3,000 rebroadcasts

weekly of World Service programmes in nearly 50 countries. The Transcrip¬
tion Service offers programmes to more than 100 countries.
Another part of the external services is the Monitoring Service which listens
to and reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news
and comment from overseas to the BBC, the Press, and the Government.
Programme links are generally rented by the BBC from the Post Office, al¬
though some are provided by the BBC with Post Office agreement. The opera¬
tion and maintenance of the transmitting stations from which its various
programmes are sent out are, however, solely a BBC responsibility.
For its domestic radio programmes, the BBC uses 141 studios in London
and the regions, and for its external services 49 in London. In addition, there
are 37 semi-automatic studios which can be operated by programme officials
without engineering staff. Each BBC local radio station has two studios. BBC
television productions come from main studios at the Television Centre in
west London and other studios in various parts of London, and from fully
equipped regional studio centres at Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,
Glasgow and Manchester. There are also television studios at Aberdeen,
Bangor, Edinburgh, Leeds, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth and Southampton.
Outside broadcasting is covered by a number of mobile units.
The IBA transmits programmes from 47 vhf and about 130 uhf stations
throughout Britain, programme links being provided by the Post Office.
Independent television programmes are produced at studio centres in Aber¬
deen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Dover, Glasgow, Leeds,
London, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth, St. Helier, and South¬
ampton. The establishment of these studios is the direct result of the IBA’s
policy of encouraging the development of regional television, and the pro¬
grammes are designed for either local or national broadcasting. A number of
new studios have also been built for colour television.
The BBC does not give publicity to any individual firm or organised interest
except when it is necessary in order to provide effective and informative pro¬
grammes. Under the terms of its licence and agreement it must not broadcast
sponsored programmes or, without the consent of the Home Secretary, broad¬
cast any matter for payment.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television and radio subject
to the relevant provisions in the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act
1973, in particular that there should be no sponsoring of programmes by
advertisers, that all advertisements should be clearly distinguishable as such
and recognisably separate from the programme, and that the amount of time
given to advertising should not be so great as to detract from the value of the
programmes as a medium of information, education and entertainment. In
any one hour of broadcasting the amount of advertising time on Independent
Television is normally limited to seven minutes. Averaged over the day’s
programmes it must not exceed six minutes per hour. The independent local
radio stations are normally limited to up to nine minutes of advertising each
hour. The IBA has drawn up a code governing standards and practice in
advertising on television and radio giving guidance about the types and methods
of advertisement that may not be used. Some types of advertising are pro¬
hibited, notably that of cigarettes (under a government ruling of 1965) and for

betting. Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of programme,
for example, in broadcasts to schools.
Broadcasts on political issues include a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament
is in session, and there is frequent coverage of political subjects in news
bulletins and current affairs programmes on both radio and television.
Ministerial and party political broadcasts are also transmitted periodically
under rules agreed between the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA.
The Home Secretary is advised on the technical aspects of television and vhf
sound broadcasting by the Television Advisory Committee, which consists of
an independent chairman, the Directors General of the BBC and IBA,
independent members, and representatives from the radio industry and
interested government departments.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and
engineering staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Post Office, the Government,
and the radio industry. Advances by the BBC have included the electronic
conversion of monochrome and colour television pictures between the Euro¬
pean and the American systems, and the development of a sound-and-vision
system, which enables the television sound and picture to be carried over a
single 625-line vision circuit, and thus eliminates the operational complexity
and expense of a separate circuit for the sound. During 1972 IBA engineers
introduced the world’s first fully digital field rate standards converter (DICE)
which improves the interchange of programmes between areas using the 525-
lines system (for example, North America) and those using the 625-lines
system (for example, Europe). In early 1973 the IBA began tests of an experi¬
mental digital data broadcasting system (‘Oracle’) for transmitting the written
word in the vertical interval of television signals. The BBC has a system known
as Ceefax and future developments will combine the best features of both
systems.
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
union manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that net¬
work and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical monitor¬
ing station, where frequency measurements and other observations on
broadcasting stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Conference whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides a large amount
of technical aid, particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting organisa¬
tions throughout the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded for
service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news-
film to some 172 television organisations in 97 countries and is the most widely
used newsfilm agency in the world, and a member of the International Tele¬
vision Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality information pro¬
grammes which are exchanged overseas. United Press International and
Independent Television News jointly provide an international newsfilm
BROADCASTING 445
service to more than 100 overseas television organisations via the Eurovision
network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on radio and
television training for overseas students in Britain and largely finances the
British Council (see p. 161), which includes in its activities training in educa¬
tional television and radio for members of broadcasting organisations overseas.
Training in television work is also provided for overseas trainees at the
Thomson Centre in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable
trust.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communications Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency re¬
sponsible for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication
services (including radio and television), for the allocation and registration of
all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative committees,
for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical
problems in broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the United King¬
dom Committee of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
23 Leisure and Sport
There is a large variety of leisure and sporting opportunities available in
Britain, both inside and outside the home. An increased standard of living has
enabled many more people to pursue new interests in their leisure time and an
improved range of facilities is being provided.
LEISURE
Home In Britain, as in many other countries, a considerable proportion of people’s
Interests time is spent in their homes; on a weekday evening, for instance, seven out of
eight of the adult population are likely to be found at home, watching television,
reading newspapers or books, listening to the radio or the record player,
playing musical instruments (guitars are particularly popular among young
people), or entertaining friends. Many people also have hobbies, for example,
gardening, home decorating and repairing, and car maintenance. The increased
percentage of households owning motor cars (52 per cent in 1971 compared
with 46 per cent in 1967) has encouraged people to take more holidays away
from home and to visit the countryside, stately homes, historic buildings
and museums. All these interests are catered for by numerous magazines and
periodicals.
About one-third of the total population are registered members of public
libraries. Book sales have increased—a widening range of titles, including works
of scholarship, being produced in the cheaper paperback form.
Sales of long playing records by manufacturers have increased sharply
during the past decade, the 1973 figure being 1217 million. The production
of ‘extended play’ or ‘single records’—on the weekly sales of which the ‘pop’
music popularity ratings, known as the ‘Top Ten’ and ‘Top Twenty’, are
calculated—reached its peak in 1964; the 1973 manufacturers’ sales figure was
74*9 million.
Most families do home decorating and painting. Gardening is another major
interest; at least half the families in Britain have some garden in spite of the
high proportion of the population living in urban areas. In many places there
are large garden centres where people purchase shrubs and other plants for
outdoor and indoor cultivation. In addition some families have allotments—
plots of land rented for cultivation. Thousands of local horticultural societies
are affiliated to the National Allotment Garden Society and-there are many un¬
affiliated societies. The numerous flower and vegetable shows held in town
and country are very popular, and there is a large attendance at the most
important of them, including the annual Chelsea Flower Show.
Entertainments The diversity of entertainments outside the home includes, for young people,
Outside the discotheques and pop concerts. The cinemas, many of which show international
Home as well as British films, are popular among young people, although audiences
in general have been declining for several years. Theatres appeal to all age
groups throughout Britain; although the theatre-going public is not a large
one, the subsidised repertory theatres (see p. 417) are well supported. Ballet,
opera and concerts of classical music also have an enthusiastic and growing
public while special art exhibitions often attract large audiences.
LEISURE AND SPORT
447
Clubs and
Groups
Dancing is popular among most age groups. There are many hundreds of
regular dance halls throughout the country, and over 2,000 schools of dancing.
These include schools of ballroom dancing as well as those teaching ballet,
many of which are attended by young children. Public dances are often
held in other halls, while clubs and societies hold dances occasionally in their
own or hired premises. For younger people dancing to pop music is more
common than formal ballroom dancing which, together with Scottish, English
and Irish traditional dances, retains a following particularly among the over¬
thirties. There is a folk dancing festival held each year at the Royal Albert
Hall in London.
The public house—known as the pub or the local—is a centre of social life
for a large number of people (especially men) in Britain. Pubs, besides
offering a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and providing (in
increasing numbers) hot and cold food, serve as places for meeting friends and
for entertainment; many have, for instance, television sets, amusement
machines and juke-boxes and provide facilities for playing darts, billiards,
dominoes and similar games. Some also employ musicians for evening enter¬
tainment, such as piano playing, folk singing and modern jazz.
‘Bingo’, a game of chance played by groups of people for prizes, is organised
throughout the country in converted cinemas and in club rooms and village
halls; legalised by the gambling Acts of the 1960s, it provides a form of social
entertainment of particular value to the elderly and lonely, and does not
involve large sums of money. There are some 128 commercial gaming clubs
which operate under strict legislative control. Betting shops number some
14,800. The turnover of money staked by the public on horse and greyhound
racing is of the order of ,£1,500 million a year, most of it on horse races.
Betting on football matches for smaller stakes, both at fixed odds and through
football pools, is widespread.
A number of people in all age groups and occupations are actively involved
in organisations such as church groups, political parties, groups of local business
and professional men (for example the Rotary Clubs), trade unions, social and
cultural groups, charities or voluntary social welfare agencies. The latter
include citizens’ rights groups which advise people on their legal rights and
their entitlement to welfare benefits. Involvement by young people in volun¬
tary work has increased and novel methods of fund raising, such as sponsoring
long-distance walks, have been introduced.
Educational and cultural pursuits are an important part of some people’s
leisure activities; every year about 2 million people attend non-vocational adult
education classes on a wide range of subjects. Thousands of people are
involved in the activities of the many amateur dramatic and music-making
societies.
Some of the longer-established clubs and societies are organised on a
national basis and have branches throughout the country; these include the
Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and the
Women’s Institutes. Working Men’s Clubs, affiliated to the Working Men’s
Club and Institute Union, number about 4,000 and have some 4 million
members; primarily social and recreational in nature, the clubs aim at pro¬
viding amenities and entertainments of a very high standard. Some 2,728
Townswomen’s Guilds, with a total membership of over 200,000, are affiliated
to the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are educational
as well as social in purpose, and they co-operate in many public welfare
activities. The aim of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes is to

improve rural life and amenities; in villages throughout England and Wales
there are over 9,300 institutes with a total of over 440,000 members. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with
similar aims and interests.
In addition there are clubs and associations catering for all kinds of interest
and hobby, for example, chess, bridge, stamp collecting, wine making,
archaeology, and rambling.
In 1973 some 4°'5 million holidays (that is, four or more nights away from
home) were taken in Great Britain by British residents while the number of
holiday visits taken abroad was 8*25 million compared with just over 5 million
in 1966. The popularity of foreign travel is attributable to several factors
besides rising incomes: the attraction of the sun which makes Spain, France
and Italy the most popular destinations for the British tourist; the many
charter and other airline services provided; and the ability of the travel trade
to provide reasonably priced holidays. A by-product has been an increase in
the number of adults who, with the help of radio and television programmes
and by attending adult classes, are studying foreign languages to add to what
they learned at school. Of those who stay in Britain many enjoy active holidays,
such as canoeing, sailing and pony-trekking; camping under canvas, in cara¬
vans and in specially equipped vehicles, is popular.
SPORT
The traditionally widespread interest in sport among participants and spec¬
tators has been stimulated by regular broadcast coverage (particularly tele¬
vision) of the major sporting events. Large crowds attend such occasions as
the association football ‘Cup Final’ at Wembley Stadium, the international
rugby matches at Twickenham and Cardiff Arms Park, the Wimbledon lawn
tennis championships, the classic horse races, and some of the cricket Test
Matches, and millions more watch them on television.
Sportsmen may be professional (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports, for
example, rugby union football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur but
in other sports the distinction between amateur and professional status is less
strictly defined. Nevertheless an important feature of British sport is its
amateur element—people who devote time and energy to organising sport and
to teaching and training, as well as the many thousands of all ages who engage
in sport for pleasure alone.
The Government does not undertake the organisation or the direct promotion
of individual sports in Britain; there is, however, a Minister of State with
responsibility for sport in the Department of the Environment, and the policy
of the Government is to foster the development of all aspects of physical
recreation, stimulating the provision of sports facilities and encouraging their
use to the fullest capacity.
The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and for
general matters affecting Great Britain), the Sports Council for Wales and the
Scottish Sports Council. Members of the councils are appointed by the
Government. The councils have the task, subject only to general ministerial
directives, of allocating funds made available by the Government. They award
grants and loans for sports development, coaching and administration to the
governing bodies of sport and to other national organisations; they assist

British representatives at international sports meetings; they encourage links
with international and overseas organisations; and they administer national
sports centres. The Sports Council consults with the Central Council of
Physical Recreation, comprising the national governing and representative
bodies of sport and physical recreation. The Sports Council is linked with
nine regional sports councils in England on which are represented local
authorities and sports interests in each region.
Sport and physical recreation in Northern Ireland are promoted by the
Northern Ireland Sports Council which was set up in 1973. The council has
powers to establish sport and recreation centres, to organise activities and to
pay grants to voluntary organisations and assist them in other ways. The
Department of Community Relations is responsible for supervising grants for
sport and recreational activities.
A bibliographic service about sport is provided by the United Kingdom
National Documentation Centre for Sport, Physical Recreation and Recrea¬
tion which has been set up by the Sports Council and is based at the Uni¬
versity of Birmingham; the council itself has an information centre providing
data on a wide range of sports topics at its headquarters. A similar service is
provided by the Sports Council for Wales. Voluntary bodies and private
concerns also make substantial provisions for sport in Britain, but the largest
provision is made by local authorities which made available some £42-6 million
in 1972-73.
The law requires all publicly maintained schools in Britain to provide for the
physical education (for example, gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and
swimming) of their pupils. Schools in the national systems (except those solely
for infants) must have a playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary
schools have a gymnasium. Some have other amenities such as swimming
pools, sports halls and halls designed for dance and movement; in a number of
areas, physical education facilities in schools are available to the whole com¬
munity outside school hours. Facilities for, and instruction in, many kinds of
sport are likewise provided at the independent preparatory and public schools
and at the universities (some of which have departments of physical education).
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities used
by the community for recreation, for example, playing fields, gymnasia, tennis
courts, golf courses, boating lakes, swimming baths and sports centres and
many arrange further education classes in various physical education subjects.
Large industrial firms often provide sports facilities for their employees and,
in many cases, make them available for the public.
Among the national voluntary bodies most closely connected with the general
development of sport are the British Olympic Association, the National Playing
Fields Association and the British Sports Association for the Disabled.
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The association’s council is composed
of the British members of the International Olympic Committee, representa¬
tives of the controlling bodies of some 25 sports, representatives of the armed
services’ sports organisations and of certain other affiliated bodies concerned
with sporting activities, and a few co-opted members. It determines the overall
size of the British team; raises funds; makes all the arrangements for the
team’s travel and comfort at the games; organises the provision and transport
of clothing and equipment; and provides a headquarters staff for the overall
management of the team.

The National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) aims to stimulate the provi¬
sion of playing fields, playgrounds and local recreation centres by publicity and
technical and financial assistance. With a council composed of representatives
of the governing bodies of sport, a number of educational bodies, voluntary
youth organisations, physical education associations, local authorities and
individuals, the NPFA gives advice on the provision and layout of sports
facilities, including small recreation centres, on matters relating to the
recreational needs of children from their earliest years, and on the establish¬
ment of playgrounds and play leadership schemes. It also distributes each year
grants to some 500 playing field, playground and local recreational centre
schemes. The NPFA is a national charity established by royal charter. It
derives its funds mainly from voluntary contributions, but it also receives a
small Sports Council grant towards administrative costs. It has branches in
Scotland and Northern Ireland and in nearly every English and Welsh county.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
sporting activities for the physically handicapped. The association, which
receives an annual Sports Council grant, provides advice on physical recrea¬
tion through sport for the disabled, arranges sports meetings at the Stoke
Mandeville Sports Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, and en¬
courages the provision of facilities (including sports clubs) for physically dis¬
abled people.
The policy of establishing sports centres bringing together people of all ages
and different recreational interests is an important part of the provision for
physical recreation in Britain.
National centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from volun¬
tary sources, are maintained by the Sports Councils and provide recreational j
facilities and a wide range of courses for instructors and performers in many
recreational activities. As well as making residential courses available for
enthusiasts from all over Britain, the national sports centres are used exten¬
sively by local clubs and the local community generally.
One centre has been developed as a national sailing centre; two are primarily
used as training centres for mountain activities, including climbing and rescue
techniques; and a fourth provides training for outdoor activities such as walk-
ing, climbing, sailing and field studies. A national water sports centre was
opened in 1973* Combined facilities for ranges of sports are provided at the
other centres which include the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in
London and the National Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff. The centre at |
Crystal Palace has a main stadium seating 12,000 spectators, a sports hall
seating 2,000 spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic require¬
ments, a teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000 spectators, an indoor cricket
school, practice rooms for all indoor activities, a hostel for 140 residents and
staff housing: these facilities are available for international competitions as well
as for training purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater
London Council, in addition to the Sports Council grant. The Cardiff centre
is supported by local authorities, as well as by Sports Council grants.
In addition to the national sports centres, other centres—such as the
Meadowbank Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh Corporation—cater
for a wide range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely
local interest. Some 200 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national
needs; many more are planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There
are also several national centres catering for specialised interests and generally

administered by the sponsoring organisations; these include the National
Equestrian Centre, run by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke
Mandeville Sports Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by the
British Paraplegic Sports Society—the first sports centre of its kind in the
world.
In Northern Ireland the first multi-purpose sports centre was opened in
1973-
Some of the major sports in Britain are described below.
Perhaps the most popular spectator sport is association football, dating as an
organised game from the nineteenth century, and controlled by separate foot¬
ball associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
England over 250 clubs are registered with the English Football Association
(FA) and some 37,000 clubs are affiliated to regional or district associations.
The English FA organises an annual cup competition, the final of which is
played in Wembley Stadium watched by some 100,000 spectators; a similar
competition is run by the Scottish and Welsh Football Associations.
The principal professional games in England and Wales are controlled by
the Football League which comprises 92 professional clubs and in Scotland
by the Scottish Football League (37 clubs); the clubs play in four divisions in
England and Wales and two in Scotland. During the season attendances at
Football League matches total about 25 million and at Scottish league matches
around 3 million. Altogether there are about 7,000-8,000 professional foot¬
ballers; these are greatly outnumbered by the nearly 1 million amateurs
(including schoolboys and members of the armed forces).
National teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland compete against each other annually and take part in European com¬
petitions and the World Cup competition.
In England amateur athletics (including track, road and cross-country running,
relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing, throwing and race
walking) are governed, for men, by the Amateur Athletic Association and, for
women, by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland have their own associations and, as in England, there are
separate women’s associations. The various organisations encourage the
development of the sport, establish uniform rules and regulations and promote
regional and national championships. Hundreds of clubs are affiliated to the
various national associations.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Amateur Athletic Board (BAAB) composed of representatives of
the national associations. British teams compete in the Olympic Games and
separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
compete in the Commonwealth Games. The BAAB also administers coaching
schemes.
The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all over
the world. Among better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering, the Argyllshire and Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon

times. Its modem form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional.
The Amateur Boxing Association controls all amateur boxing in England
including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing in the
armed services. There are separate associations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The associations organise various amateur boxing competi¬
tions, and teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland take
part in international competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The board has strict medical regulations which provide for
an examination of boxers before and after each contest, and for an extensive
annual medical examination. In addition the board appoints inspectors,
medical officers and representatives to ensure that the regulations are observed
and to guard against over-matching and exploitation.
Amateur and professional boxing championships are decided at various
weights—11 in amateur and 10 in professional boxing.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game. It is known to have been played as early as the
1550s. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in London and which
reframed the laws of the game. Cricket in Britain is now governed by the
Cricket Council which consists of representatives of the MCC, the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first class cricket) and the National
Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket).
The game is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns
and villages there are amateur teams who play weekly games from late April
to the end of September. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a
network of League cricket contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players
reinforced by professionals, some of whom come from overseas.
Some of the best supported games are the annual series of Test Matches
played between England and a touring team from Australia, New Zealand,
India, Pakistan or the West Indies. The matches last five days and crowds of
up to 25,000 watch them in addition to the millions who follow the progress
of the games on television and radio. A team representing England makes
tours to these countries in December-March. In addition to the Test Matches
there is a First Class County Championship of three-day games played by 17
county teams who also take part in three one-day sponsored competitions—
two of these are knock-out competitions and the other is a Sunday League.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926.
The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of the most popular
field sports (hunting, game shooting and fishing) which have a long history
and play a considerable part in the life of the countryside.
Fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most important
British hunting sport but there is also stag hunting (in Devon and Somerset),
hunting the hare, and otter hunting along river banks. The fox hunting season
lasts from early November to April and is preceded by the hunting of young
foxes when young hounds are trained. There are 200 packs of hounds in
Britain and hunts are financed mainly by subscriptions of their members and

by steeplechase point-to-points which take place at the end of the season and
which attract large crowds.
Game shooting as an organised country sport probably originated in the
early part of the nineteenth century. Game consists of grouse, partridge,
pheasant, snipe and woodcock and these species are protected by law during a
close season when they are allowed to breed in security on numerous estates
supervised by privately employed game-keepers. It is necessary to have a
licence to kill game and a certificate must be obtained from the local police by
anyone who possesses, purchases or acquires a shot gun. The Game Conser¬
vancy, formed by landowners, farmers and others interested in game conser¬
vation, collects information and studies factors controlling game population.
Other shooting sports are wild-fowling which takes place on marshes and
fenlands, and deer stalking which is mainly a sport of the Scottish Highlands.
The deer are preserved in ‘deer forests’ and are protected during close seasons.
The most popular country sport is fishing, there being some 2-3 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout particularly in the rivers
and lochs of Scotland, but in England and Wales the most widely practised
form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream. Angling clubs affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
(NFA) and many clubs organise match angling—a competitive form of coarse
fishing by weight. A national championship is organised by the NFA which
also enters a team in the International Angling Competition. Freshwater
fishing usually has to be paid for; most coarse fishing is let to angling clubs by
private owners while trout and salmon fishermen either rent a stretch of river,
join a club, or pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month. Coastal and
deep sea fishing are free to all (apart from salmon and sea trout fishing which
is by licence only).
Golf originated in Scotland where it has for centuries borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, the headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club being situated at St. Andrews on the east coast. The sport is now played
throughout Britain and there are golf courses in the vicinity of many towns
and villages, some of which are owned by local authorities. The main event of
the golfing year is the Open Golf Championship and other important events
include the Walker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup match for
professionals, both being played between Britain and the United States.
The modern game of lawn tennis was first played in England in 1872 and the
first championships at Wimbledon in 1877- The controlling body, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888. The main event of the season is the
annual Wimbledon fortnight for players from all over the world; these draw
large crowds, the grounds at the All-England Club accommodating over 30,000
spectators. Another important tournament is the British Hard Court Cham¬
pionships. There are also county championships and national competitions
for boys’ and girls’ schools. International events include the Davis Cup for
men and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the United
States compete for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports is motor racing; the governing body
is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) and the motor clubs registered with it
organise annual sporting events. The RAC issues competition licences cover¬
ing all events from hill climbs to full international race meetings. In addition
the RAC organises the British Grand Prix which counts towards the Formula
One World Motor Racing Championships.

Riding
BRITAIN I975: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Another motor sport is motor cycle racing. The governing body is the Auto
Cycle Union and the most important contest of the year is the Isle of Man
Tourist Trophy. Motor cycle speedway racing is governed by the Speedway
Control Board.
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early Novem¬
ber) and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from August to June). The Derby
run at Epsom in early June is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the Two Thousand Guineas (for colts and fillies) and
the One Thousand Guineas (for fillies only), both run at Newmarket; the Oaks
(for fillies) run at Epsom; and the St. Leger (for colts and fillies) run at Don¬
caster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is the
National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham in March. The Grand National,
run at Aintree near Liverpool, is the best known single steeplechase.
The Jockey Club controls all horse racing in Britain and its rules are the
basis of universal turf procedure; it also licenses 62 race courses in Great
Britain. Over 900 days’ racing are held each year and 13,000 horses are in
training in Great Britain.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare takes place at some 110
tracks licensed by local authorities; meetings are usually held two or three
times a week at each track. Rules for the sport are drawn up by the National
Greyhound Racing Club which also licenses track officials and trainers and
promotes veterinary research. Racing can only be conducted at a licensed track
and for 130 racing days in a licensing year (1 July-30 June). Some 10,000
registered greyhounds are in training under the National Greyhound Racing
Club Rules.
Betting takes place on horse and greyhound racing, ‘bookmakers’ providing
facilities on and off race courses and greyhound tracks. Bets laid off course,
mainly through licensed betting offices, comprise 86 per cent of the betting
turnover. A form of pool betting (totalisator betting) is organised on and off
course by the Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB). Most greyhound tracks
operate their own totalisators under strict local authority control. Bookmakers
and the HTB have to contribute a ‘betting levy’ to the Horserace Betting Levy
Board which promotes the advancement of veterinary science and the improve¬
ment of breeds of horses (including the work of the National Stud at New¬
market) and horse racing in general.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) in Great
Britain is the British Equestrian Federation which co-ordinates the work of the
British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association, and runs the
National Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh.
The British Horse Society promotes the interests of horse and pony breed¬
ing and furthers the art of riding. It provides tests, lectures, publications, a
film library, courses and examinations and, together with riding schools
approved by it, helps to promote horsemastership. With some 24,000 mem¬
bers, the society is also the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club
movement. The Pony Club and the Riding Clubs run their own national
championships, the latter organising the annual Riding Club Horseshoe Long
Distance Ride which is a test of stamina for horses and riders.
Horse trials are held during the spring and summer under the auspices of
the society. The three-day events held each year—in April at Badminton,
Avon, in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in September at Burghley House,
Lincolnshire—include dressage, cross-country riding and show jumping.

Sailing
Other Sports
Show jumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association
which draws up rules for judging competitions and prescribing the general
standards and height of obstacles for show jumping. The association keeps a
register of horses and ponies taking part in affiliated shows and seeks to im¬
prove the standard of jumping and to provide for the representation of Great
Britain in international competitions. It has 15,000 members and 950 shows
are affiliated to it. The two major show jumping events are the Royal Inter¬
national Horse Show and the Horse of the Year Show.
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules: Rugby Union
football, in which there are 15 players in a team, is played by amateurs while
Rugby League football (a 13-a-side game) is played by professionals as well as
amateurs.
Rugby Union is played throughout Britain under the auspices of English,
Welsh, Scottish and Irish rugby football unions. International matches
between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France are played each year
and there are tours by international teams. County championships are
organised by the English Rugby Union.
Rugby League football is played mostly in the north of England. The
governing body is the Rugby Football League which sends touring teams to
Australia and New Zealand. Annual matches are also played against France.
The Rugby League Challenge Cup Final is the major match of the season and
is played at Wembley Stadium in London.
Sailing has always been popular on Britain’s inland and coastal waters. The
Royal Yachting Association has over 1,500 clubs and 40,000 members. It also
has many recognised schools giving courses for novices, organises a National
Sailing Centre where instructors are coached and tested, and selects the
British Olympic team. One of the world’s principal regattas takes place each
year at Cowes in the Isle of Wight and major events are held at other British
sailing centres.
The governing bodies of some other sports played in Britain are given below.
Most of these are organised on the basis of clubs and regional organisations
linked to a national body. The governing bodies’ functions are broadly similar
and usually include drawing up the rules of the sport, organising regional and
national competitions and maintaining relations with sporting bodies overseas.
Many of the sports listed below have separate national bodies for Scotland
and Wales.

Metric Equivalents for British Weights and Measures
The Metrication Board was set up in 1969 to promote the planning and publicising of
the changeover to the international system of units for weights and measures through¬

previous season and future prospects; many weekly or monthly periodicals on sport are also published.
Index
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter
rather than under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. {that is, Accidents,
Royal Society for the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases
where the first word is not separable, however {for example, Royal Air Force,
Royal Society), entries will be found appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only
where they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed
under the relevant subject headings.

Traditional materials have contributed to the varied pattern
of building seen in Britain. Some materials are illustrated
here: flint cobble; sandstone contrast; timber framing ; j
carved brick; oolite stone roofs; reed thatching; pebble
dash; ornamental lead work; and cast iron.
The end papers show modern architecture using mainly
steel framing and concrete, glass, and brick.
