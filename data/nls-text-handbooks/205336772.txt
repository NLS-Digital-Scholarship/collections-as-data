Introductory Note
AN official handbook on these lines appeared first in 1946 as part of the
British Information Services overseas. Experience had shown that there was in
existence no one book prepared primarily for the oversea reader and designed to
answer the questions about Britain which are most frequently asked in oversea
countries by their writers and teachers, their officials and administrators, their
economists and businessmen, and other leaders of their public life. In meeting
this need the handbook, which has a limited free distribution overseas, has
proved valuable; five revised or rewritten editions have been issued; and the book
is now established as a main foundation of the reference and library services
provided by the official British Information Services in oversea countries.
In I954> Britain: An Official Handbook was for the first time placed on sale
throughout the world. The results have justified the preparation of this further
revised edition (i955)> &nd it is hoped to continue the publication as an annual.
The handbook, which is prepared by the Reference Division of the Central
Office of Information with the co-operation of other Government Departments and
of many national organizations, contains factual and statistical information, com¬
piled from authoritative and official sources, about the United Kingdom, its
people and its institutions. It does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it
attempt to describe the part played by Britain in Commonwealth and world
affairs. Its principal purpose is to provide basic data on the main aspects of
national administration and national economy and to give an account of the part
played by the Government in the life of the community.
In considering its contents, readers in the United Kingdom are asked to
remember the original purpose of the book—its oversea distribution. Should any
readers need additional or more detailed information they are referred to the
Annual Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics issued by
the Central Statistical Office, and to the standard works of reference and Govern¬
ment publications, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end of this
handbook. They are asked to note that the Central Office of Information ref¬
erence papers listed in the bibliography as obtainable free of charge are available
only at United Kingdom Information Offices overseas and for visitors to Britain.
In general, the contents of the handbook refer to the United Kingdom as a
whole, but where separate facts or figures are available for England and Wales,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland, these have, in some cases, been given.

I. THE BRITISH ISLES
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe, with a
total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest two islands are Great Britain
proper (comprising the greater parts of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland
(comprising Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland). Off the southern coast
of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of
Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous
islands and to the far north are the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands.
All these form administrative counties or parts of counties, but the Isle of Man in
the heart of the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and
France have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of
England, Wales or Scotland.
England (including the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border), with a total
area including inland water of 32,558,774 acres, is divided into 41 geographical or
50 administrative counties; Wales, with 4,780,533 acres, into 12 counties. Scotland,
including its 186 inhabited islands, has a total area of 19,463,016 acres, and is
divided into 33 counties.
Care must always be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together for
many administrative and other purposes), or to Great Britain which comprises
England, Wales and Scotland. The position is further complicated by the fact that
the county of Monmouth is sometimes included with Wales. The ‘United Kingdom’
—formerly the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, now the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland—is Great Britain with the addition
of the six counties of Northern Ireland, 3,488,643 acres. Statistics and other data
sometimes include but sometimes exclude the Isle of Man, 141,263 acres, and the
Channel Islands, off the coast of F ranee, 48,083 acres, which are strictly not part of the
United Kingdom. Since southern Ireland became a separate country and indepen¬
dent republic, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North just cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet Head,
is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o° passes through the old Observatory
of Greenwich (London), while the easternmost point of England reaches nearly
1 45' East and the westernmost point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West. In
general terms the British Isles lie mainly within the rectangle 50-60 degrees North
and 0-10 degrees West. It is thus rather under 600 miles in a straight line from
the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and rather over 300 miles across in
the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays and inlets no point in the British Isles
is as much as 75 miles from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less than
50 fathoms or 300 feet—because the islands lie on the continental shelf. To the
north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly from 600 feet
to 3,000. These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish. The North Atlantic Current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect
of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Despite their small area, the British Isles include rocks representing all the
major geological periods. It is largely because of their long and complicated
geological history that the British Isles have a range of scenery almost unrivalled in
any other area of comparable size.
In the main island of Great Britain the hilly and mountainous areas lie to the
north and west, so that it is possible to draw a broad distinction between Highland
Britain and Lowland Britain. An irregular line joining the mouth of the Tyne in
the north-east with the mouth of the Exe in the south-west marks the division
between these two contrasted parts of Britain.
Highland Britain thus includes the whole of Scotland; the broad upland running
from north to south through the north of England and known as the Pennines; the
well-known Lake District in the north-west of England; practically the whole of
Wales; and the south-western peninsula coinciding approximately with the counties
of Devon and Cornwall. Highland Britain is built up almost entirely of rocks older
in age than the Coal Measures and there are large tracts of the surface lying more
than 1,000 feet above sea level. Many parts of the surface have only thin, poor soils,
with the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of
south-west England. In most areas the farmer has only cultivated the valley lands
and the plains where soils are deeper and richer, so that human settlements are
sometimes widely scattered, and villages and towns may be separated by uplands
with few if any habitations.
Loidand Britain, comprising south-east England and the Midlands, is built up
almost entirely of rocks younger than the Coal Measures, which are less resistant
to weathering and have broken down to form deep fertile soils. Scarcely any part
of Lowland Britain reaches 1,000 feet above sea level, so that practically the whole,
with the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, has been cultivated,
and farmland stretches over the whole area except where interrupted by urban and
industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage systems have been developed
through the centuries to bring under cultivation the fertile soil of the low-lying
Fenland of Lincolnshire and other nearby areas in East Anglia.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors of
present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age, and
at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north of a line
joining the Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by ice caps and ice sheets.
The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had previously
been formed, so that when the ice eventually disappeared the hills stood out as
barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris, boulders, boulder-clay,
sands and gravels, lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked
up previous drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried
up, leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption of the
previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland are irregularly
disposed round the fringes of the island, and in the higher parts the moorland cover
resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Because of the complex geology and the varied relief which results, Britain enjoys
not only very attractive and contrasting scenery within short distances but a charac¬
teristic, ever different, coastline. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along
THE BRITISH ISLES

much of the west coHst of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are notable features
in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of Land’s End; the limestone
masses or forbidding slates of the Pembrokeshire coast; the red sandstone of St.
Bees Head; and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa. Even
around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white
limestone—the chalk—gives rise to the world-famous white cliffs of Dover or the
Needles off the Isle of Wight. Near at hand are accumulations of sand and shingle,
and such tracts as Chesil Beach, Dungeness and the sandspits of the Norfolk coast
have their own peculiar beauty. The eastern coast of England between the Humber
and the Thames estuary is for the most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years
some stretches of it have been protected against the sea by embankments. These
have occasionally been breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which
was caused by the abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high
tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of the
sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the short
British rivers valuable as natural havens. In times past every little cove round the
rocky coasts afforded shelter to a fishing village from the waves of the North Sea or
the giant rollers of the Atlantic.
Situated for the most part on the border land between Highland and Lowland
Britain are the outcrops of the Coal Measures containing nearly all Britain’s coal.
The older coal workings and collieries are usually found where the coal seams are at
or near the surface and where the early miners followed them up the deep valleys
into the highlands, as in Yorkshire. The modern deep collieries seek the coal
where it lies beneath a cover of younger rocks and amid the farming lands of
Lowland Britain. This also is well seen in Yorkshire where the newer pits are ever
moving farther and farther east into farming country. Most of the coalfields of
Britain, including those of the great Central Lowlands of Scotland, have given rise
to industrial regions, so that the old rural pattern of British settlement, based
essentially on the occurrence of good soils suitable for intensive farming, has been
largely overlaid by the newer urban industrial pattern which is still growing and
spreading.
Britain does not suffer from extremes of climate. It lies entirely in middle
latitudes and the dominant winds are south-westerly. The weather from day to day
depends mainly on a succession of depressions or lows, with intervening ridges of
high pressure, which tend to approach the British Isles from the Atlantic and to
pass over in an easterly direction. Long periods of settled weather associated with
stable air masses are the exception rather than the rule.
Throughout the British Isles winters can usually be described as mild compared
with other countries in the same latitude. The warmest parts of the British Isles,
the extreme south-west and the Scilly Isles, have an average January screen
temperature of 44 to 47 F. Except on exposed mountains, temperatures as low
as 10 F. are rare and o° F. has been recorded only during exceptionally cold
winters.
The summers are warm rather than hot. The average for July, usually the
warmest month, ranges from 64° F. in the London area to about 550 F. in the
extreme north. Temperatures of 90° F. and above are infrequent, and ioo° F. has
scarcely ever been recorded.
Because the dominant south-west winds are humid this is the rainy quarter and
there is a great contrast between the extremely heavy rainfall of the western moun¬
tains—in some areas over 150 inches a year—and the relatively dry east coast tracts
where the average may be less than 20 inches a year. The average rainfall of the
4
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
United Kingdom as a whole is about 40 inches a year. Although the English farmer
may complain of droughts, the rainfall is much more regular than in many other
countries. A period of as long as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and
confined to limited areas.
Although Britain’s fogs, to a large extent accentuated by the smoky atmosphere
of London and other big cities, have attained world-wide notoriety, severe fogs are
nowadays less frequent and are seldom widespread, though occasionally, as in the
winter of 1952-53, fog persists for many consecutive days in certain areas.
Although on most days there is some sunshine, the hours of sunshine throughout
the year are relatively low owing to broken cloud cover; the average per cent of
the possible total ranges from less than 20 in the Scottish Highlands to rather more
than 40 locally in the south and south-east coasts of England.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of natural
vegetation cover. When the islands were first settled, oak woodland doubtless
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to thin forests of Scots fir on
higher or sandy ground, interrupted by extensive marshlands and perhaps some
open moorland. In the course of the centuries nearly all the forests have been
cleared so that forest and woodland now occupy only about 6 per cent of the surface
of the country. Midland Britain appears to be well wooded because of the numerous
hedgerows and isolated trees.
The hilly moorland with its heather (and cotton grass in the wetter parts),
with its numerous hill grasses and the bracken fern, is a semi-natural wild vegeta¬
tion. Most of Lowland Britain consists either of grass pastureland, representing
centuries of careful management, or ploughland. Because the rainfall varies little in
quantity from month to month, streams rarely dry up and grass remains green
throughout the year.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession
of invaders and colonizers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were the
Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after settling in
northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating the French
language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the rela¬
tive importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-
Saxons and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present
English, Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over most of
England and the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon came to pre¬
dominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and Norman-French,
while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man,
the Highlands of Scotland and Ireland.
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of popula¬
tion or of the extent or direction of population movement until the beginning of
the nineteenth century. It is believed that at the end of the eleventh century the
population of Great Britain was of the order of two million, while at the end of the
seventeenth a reasonable contemporary estimate put the population of England and
Wales at 5^ million and the population of Scotland at about one million. Natural
increase was the main factor in this slow growth, though it was kept down in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by high death
rates and particularly by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration
THE BRITISH ISLES
from the continent of Europe, e.g., of Flemish weavers, was an influence at certain
times.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people, their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, marriages,
occupations, language and family structure, is relatively plentiful and reliable. Most
of it is derived from two main sources: the periodic census of population which
gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time, and the regular flow of
statistical information based on statutory registration of births, marriages and
deaths.
The Census
Censuses of the people of Great Britain were taken regularly every ten years from
1801 to 1931. There was no census between 1931 and 1951, but a count of the
population by age and sex was a by-product of the national registration which was
instituted at the outbreak of the second world war in September 1939.
Censuses were taken on 8th April 1951 by the appropriate authorities in the
United Kingdom, the islands of the British Seas and the Republic of Ireland.1 This
was the first simultaneous population count covering all these areas since the
censuses of 1911. The co-operation of the Republic of Ireland in arranging a
simultaneous census was of particular value, owing to the considerable sea and
land traffic and the movement of population between that country and the United
Kingdom.
Preliminary reports of the censuses of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland were obtained, in advance of the main statistical operations, direct from
summaries supplied by the local census officers. They are, therefore, provisional,
though no material correction to their figures is expected to be necessary. They
relate only to the numbers of the population by sex for each country and for
administrative areas within each country, except that in the Scottish report there
is a table indicating by counties the number and percentage of the population
returned as speaking Gaelic. A number of local reports giving final detailed informa¬
tion for major administrative areas (counties, county boroughs or, in Scotland,
large burghs) have since been published, but the compilation of detailed final
reports on a national scale must await the completion of the local series. To obtain
advance information on the many matters covered by the Census, an analysis was
made of a representative one per cent sample of the returns for Great Britain.
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this chapter is
based mainly on census reports (including the 1951 Census One Per Cent Sample
Tables) and on the regular returns of births, marriages and deaths, though some
use has been made of other special investigations.
Total Population
The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the census taken on
8th April 1951 was, to the nearest thousand, 50,212,000, excluding 158,000 persons
in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the
United Kingdom. This represented a population density of about 533 persons per
square mile, which is one of the highest in the world and is still rising.
These authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London- the
General Registry Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry of
finance of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of the Isle of Man of
Jersey and of Guernsey and its associated islands; the Central Statistical Office of the
Republic of Ireland.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The population has increased by about zi million since mid-1939, by about
4 million since 1931, by about 6 million since 1921 and by about 43 million—or
about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a progressive
reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates into the beginning
of the twentieth century. The population is still increasing, though relatively slowly,
and at the end of 1953 the resident population of the United Kingdom was estimated
at 50,674,000.

Birth and Death Rates.1 During the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was
usually about 3J per cent. The annual death rate was just over 2 per cent. Both
birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century, but the natural
increase of the population changed but little. It rose from 1-2 per cent in 1851 to
1-4 per cent in 1881, and fell to i-i per cent in 1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age groups,
produced a population of low average age and at each successive census the popula¬
tion of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the preceding census.
When, therefore, death rates in all age groups fell by an average of about 33 per
cent, as they did between 1880 and 1910, the result was first a very low crude death
1 Birth and death rates are the ratios of live-births and deaths to the population or
population-group concerned. Strictly speaking, the ratios of total live-births and total
deaths to total population should be referred to as crude birth and death rates (in contrast
with age-specific or other specific rates). In common usage, however, the word ‘crude’
is often omitted, particularly in reference to birth rates.

rate which helped to maintain the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth
rate, and, secondly, a gradual increase in the average age of the population.
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth-century
rate. Kven so, the population continued to increase slowly, though its average age
rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, crude death rates remained nearly
stationary at around i -2 per cent though the death rates continued to fall heavily in
all age groups, particularly among pre-school children, school children, and adults
in their thirties and forties. From 1932 onwards the birth rate steadied itself and
thereafter rose slowly up to the outbreak of war, after which all orderly movement
was interrupted by the disturbed conditions of the war years. The 1947 birth rate
(20-7 per thousand of the population) was the highest since 1921, but the 1948,
1949. 195°, 1951 and 1952 birth rates were progressively lower, though higher than
pre-war. The 1953 birth rate was 15-8 per thousand of the population, and was
slightly higher than that of 1952.

. Mortality Causes. The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition,
rising standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in
personal hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally
available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on mothers
and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis and infant and
maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main acute
infectious diseases of childhood is less than one-thirtieth, and mortality from
tuberculosis is less than one-tenth of the rates prevailing in the mid-nineteenth
century. Infant mortality has fallen by about 80 per cent since 1900, and between
1934 and 1942 maternal mortality was halved and has since continued to fall.
The reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases of middle and old age
has risen during the twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the
B
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
8
improvement in diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered
effective measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvement in positive
health does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Fertility Trends. The fall in births during the twentieth century has taken place
in spite of an increase in the marriage rate and a drop in the usual age of marriage
for women. It is due mainly to a decline in the number of children born per
married couple (the average size of the family). Couples married in the mid-
Victorian era produced on the average five to six liveborn children. Among the
couples married in the years 1925-29 the figure may be estimated at 2-2.
At first the decline in family size was most marked among the professional and
salaried classes. Among couples married between 1900 and 193° the families of
manual workers were about 40 per cent larger than those of non-manual workers,
but this class difference appears to have been diminishing. The decline in family
size has been considerably slower among Roman Catholics than in the rest of the
population, and slower in Scotland and Northern Ireland than in England and
Wales.
Changing social habits and the disturbing effects of war preclude any reliable
estimate of long-term trends in family size since 1939. though there is some
evidence of a slight increase.
Migration. Over the whole 150 years since the beginning of the nineteenth
century, net migration has been markedly outward. About 25 million persons born
in the British Isles are estimated to have gone overseas in this period to settle in
the United States and Commonwealth countries. On the other hand large numbers
of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles and Germans, have entered the British Isles
during the last 80 years. The net loss by migration since 1871 from the present
area of the United Kingdom is about 3! million. During the inter-censal period
I93I_SI the net balance of migration to and from the United Kingdom was inward
for the first time in the past century. The net gain to the United Kingdom from
civilian migration was about half a million, a net gain of three-quarters of a million
to England and Wales being offset by net losses from Scotland and Northern
Ireland. This net gain was the balance of a large outward movement mainly of
British subjects emigrating, mostly since 1945, to Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and South Africa, and a larger inward movement mainly of aliens from Europe,
many of whom were refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. Taking the post-war
period only, however, the net balance of migration has been outward, owing to the
high net outflow (some 85,000 a year) to Commonwealth countries.
Age Distribution. The continuous fall in death rates and the low inter-war birth
rates are beginning to increase the proportion of elderly people, and thus to reduce
the proportion of the working population to the total population. The small age
groups born between the wars have been and are still coming to maturity. The size
of the age groups reaching retirement age increases yearly, as these groups were
born during a period of rapidly expanding population. The continuing fall of the
death rate in all age groups has still further increased the number of old persons.
Moreover, the higher birth rates since 1942 have arrested the compensating fall in
the number of dependent children. In December 1953 the age distribution of the
United Kingdom was estimated as follows:
Under 15 . . . . 22-7 per cent
65 and over . . . . ii-i per cent
15 to 64 . . . . 66-2 per cent
During the present decade an unusually large proportion of the population of
THE BRITISH ISLES
9
Britain will be between 40 and 50 years of age. Assuming that mortality rates
continue to fall, and disregarding migration, it can therefore be shown that:
(1) over the next 15 years the population of working age will remain roughly
constant;
(2) the number of old people (over 65) will increase over the next 30 years by
about three million.
These predictions are independent of the future course of births.
Sex Ratio. Total births of boys usually exceed those of girls by about 5 per cent,
but owing to the higher stillbirth rate and infant mortality among boys, and the
higher male death rates in all age groups, women have for the past 100 years out¬
numbered men from adolescence onwards and in the total population. Their pre¬
dominance increases with age and is now nearly 50 per cent among persons over
70 years of age.
The fall in mortality has affected the sex ratio by increasing the proportion of old
persons in both sexes, which has made female predominance in those age groups a
weightier factor in the sex ratio of the population as a whole. At the same time
there has been a slight rise in the proportion of boys among children under 15 years
of age.
The proportion of females to males in the total population has not varied greatly,
however, as these two effects have counterbalanced each other. At present there are
between six and seven per cent more females than males.
Population Policy
If the future brings a further reduction in family size, the decline of annual births
will become rapid, with serious effects on the trend of population. Fear of this
eventuality was an important factor in a growing concern with population problems,
which led to the appointment in March 1944 of a Royal Commission on Population
to inquire into the facts concerning British population trends, their causes and
probable consequences; and to ‘consider what measures, if any, should be taken in
the national interest to influence the future trend of population’.
The Commission reported in March 1949. It found that the main cause, and
very probably the only cause, of the fall in family size was the spread of deliberate
family limitation. In the course of the nineteenth century powerful economic, social
and cultural forces combined to tell against the continued acceptance of an uncon¬
trolled birth rate. Changes in economic organization were reducing the importance
of the family as a productive unit, while the Factory and Education Acts were
extending the period during which children were an unrelieved expense to their
parents. The result was that, in all classes of society except the wealthiest, married
couples with young children to support were at an economic disadvantage compared
with childless couples; and parents with a family of several young children were at
a disadvantage as compared with those with only one or two.
The Commission’s recommendations aimed at reducing the economic disadvan¬
tages of parenthood. It proposed increased family allowances; reform of income
tax to reduce the disadvantages of parenthood for the well-to-do; the building of
more houses with more than three bedrooms; the further development of family
health and welfare services; and research and education in population questions.

THE BRITISH ISLES
II
The populations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and of each
of the principal regions of England were in every case greater in 1951 than in 1931,
whereas in the period 1921-31 the populations of Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland had declined. The greatest increases were in the eastern, southern, midland
and south-western districts of England, and in Northern Ireland. The smallest
increase was in Wales.
1 he population of the United Kingdom taken as a whole is predominantly urban
and suburban. During the nineteenth century, when the labour demands of newly
developing industry drew great numbers from the countryside to the towns, the
urban element continuously and rapidly outgrew the rural element. At the end of
the nineteenth century 75 per cent of the British population was living within the
boundaries of urban administrative areas and the large conurbation (see footnote
(d) Table 2) was already the dominant type of British community. By 1911 the
economic and social limits of these conurbations extended far beyond the adminis¬
trative boundaries of the cities which fonned their core, owing to the building of
outer suburbs which linked up neighbouring towns. Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent
of the population has lived in the seven great conurbations whose centres are the
cities of London, Glasgow, Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Manchester,
Liverpool, Leeds and Bradford, and Newcastle upon Tyne.
During the twentieth century the general character of urbanization changed, the
later increases in urban areas being relatively much smaller and much more due to
the natural growth of the towns than to the withdrawal of rural population. More¬
over, two new and decided trends became apparent: first, the outer rings of con¬
urbations and the suburbs of large cities began to increase in population much
more rapidly than the large cities themselves; secondly, there was a considerable
migration, particularly of young adults, to the expanding new light industries and
suburban residential areas springing up in and around London and Birmingham.
This movement was intensified by the heavy unemployment of the inter-war years
which affected with particular severity the textile and heavy engineering industries
of Scotland, Northern England and South Wales.
The combined effect of these two trends was that the outer rings of the London
and Birmingham conurbations increased most in population while the remoter
country areas and some industrial towns of Scotland, Wales and Northern England
declined. In urban areas in England and Wales, the medium-sized towns of between
50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants increased most rapidly, while the populations of
very large or very small towns tended to decline.
The second world war halted suburban building and for a time reduced the
population of conurbations and large cities, but by the end of the war many people
had returned to the neighbourhood of their pre-war homes. In 1951 many large
cities and towns had larger populations than in 1939, but the populations of others,
notably London, were reduced. The decrease in the County of London was about
two-thirds of a million, and in spite of an increase in the population of the outer
ring, the population of Greater London in 1951 (8,346,000 to the nearest thousand)
was 382,000 less than in 1939. The populations of many urban and rural areas
surrounding Greater London have continued to increase very rapidly.
After 1939 and therefore probably at least in part as a result of the war—there
was a marked change in the relative rates of growth of rural and urban areas as
a whole, and of small, medium-sized and large towns. For the first time in 100
years the population of administrative rural areas grew faster than that of urban
areas, while within urban areas the greatest growth occurred in towns of 40,000
to 75,000 inhabitants, and smaller towns appeared to be increasing almost as
fast.

Language
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language pre¬
dominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic, is the first
language of most of the population in some of the central and northern counties
and (according to the Census One Per Cent Sample Tables) was spoken by about
a quarter of the population at the time of the 1951 census. According to the 1951
census of Scotland nearly 100,000 persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness,
Argyll, and Lanark, speak the Scottish form of Gaelic,1 while a few scattered families
in Northern Ireland speak the Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish
varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living languages, although Manx is used
in addition to English for certain official pronouncements in the Isle of Man.
French is still the official language of Jersey, but, in Guernsey, English is now
, 1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included
in the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, and Argyll.

used for all official proceedings. English is generally spoken throughout the Channel
Islands, although a Norman French patois is still spoken there by some people.
Social Patterns
A general summary of trends in social organization, similar in scope to the fore¬
going summary of population trends, is not practicable. Human relations and
behaviour are too complex and too little susceptible to precise statistical treatment,
while sources of sociological information are incomplete and not always reliable. It
may be useful, however, to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of
British households and the extent and use of leisure in Britain in order to provide a
background for the consideration, in later chapters, of a number of planning
problems, particularly those of town planning, housing and transport.
Number and Composition of Households
In Great Britain, as in other countries, most people live as members of private
households (usually families). Less than 5 per cent of the population was enumer¬
ated by the censuses of 1911, 1921, 1931 and 1951 in institutions (hotels, schools,
hospitals, etc.).
In 1911 there were about nine million private households1 in Great Britain. By
1951, according to the Census One Per Cent Sample Tables, there were about
14 J million households, an increase of about 60 per cent. This expansion seems out
of proportion to the 19 per cent increase in the total population for the same period.
It was in fact comparable with the increase in the population of persons over 24
years old and the slightly larger increase in the number of married persons. In other
words, the increasing age of the population meant more but smaller families. The
average size of household in Great Britain fell from 4’5 persons in 1911 to 3‘2 in
1951. In England and Wales the number of persons living in households of one or
two persons almost tripled between 1911 and i93i. At the end of this period such
households constituted about 40 per cent of private households and comprised
about 20 per cent of the population in private households. About two-thirds of the
persons living alone in 1951 were 60 years of age or over, while in at least 43 per
cent of families of two persons, at least one member of the household was 60 or over.
It has been difficult to increase the number of separate dwelling-places (houses
or flats) sufficiently rapidly to overtake the increasing number of private house¬
holds, and this difficulty was aggravated by the suspension of house-building and
destruction of property during the second world war. There were in 1951 only
some 13'3 million structurally separate dwelling-places in Great Britain, so that
over 2 million households had to share a home (see page 321). It is unofficially
estimated that about three-quarters of all dwellings in Great Britain are terraced or
semi-detached houses (usually of 4 to 6 dwelling-rooms including bedrooms) while
the remaining quarter consists of detached houses and flats in approximately equal
numbers. The proportion of flats is greatly above average in Scotland (estimated at
about 60 per cent) and considerably above average in London (estimated at
17 per cent).
Of the 14J million private households in Great Britain, n | million were esti¬
mated in the 1951 Census Sample to be of the simplest type, comprising married
couples or widowed persons with their children, if any, or persons living alone.
More specifically, they comprised 3'2 million married couples with no children,
900,000 widowed persons living alone, 6’9 million married couples or widowed
persons with children of any age, 600,000 single persons living alone. Over a third

15
of all married couples living alone were 60 years old or over; less than a quarter of
the married couples under 40 years of age in these simplest types of household had
no children; and the majority of the single persons living alone were over 40 years
old.
Nearly another million households were of these simple types except for the
inclusion of parents or non-married brothers or sisters of the head of the household.
Only 2 million households contained persons less closely related to the head than
parent or brother or sister, or contained non-relatives. There were nearly a million
families consisting of married couples, or married or widowed persons with
children, who were without their own homes, and the majority of these were living
in the homes of their parents. Apart from these satellite family groups, 1,102,700
households contained an aggregate of 1,240,000 other persons unrelated or distantly
related to the head of the household, the bulk of whom were presumably of the
status of boarders. Of these more than half a million constituted sole individual
additions to the more normal types of families with married heads. There were
nearly 300,000 households consisting of two persons who were distantly related or
were unrelated to one another.
Over 8 million households (57 per cent of all households) were estimated in the
1951 Census Sample Tables to be without children under 16, while another 3-1
million contained only one child.
In Great Britain as a whole it was estimated that, in 1951, 180,000 households
had resident domestic servants, who numbered, in all, 205,000. Of these, about
half were in households of one or two other persons, and over a quarter were in the
households of single or widowed or divorced persons, 40 years old or over, living
alone except for a servant. A sample analysis of 193* census data covering only
England and Wales estimated 706,800 resident domestic servants in private house¬
holds, which compares with 178,000 in England and Wales in 1951.
Work and Leisure
The great majority of British males over 15 years of age are in full-time gainful
employment, and the majority of females are either housewives or in full-time
gainful employment (see p. 226). In many cases housewives also undertake part-
time or even full-time employment.
Agreed hours of full-time work for the majority of occupations are usually about
44 hours a w7eek, with some variation on each side. Actual weekly hours worked by
men average a little longer owing to overtime working, and actual hours worked by
women and girls average a little less (see p. 243). To these hours must often be
added the time taken in travel to and from work. According to a sample survey
made in August 1943, over 75 per cent of wage earners in large towns spent half an
hour a day travelling to and from work, mainly by public transport, while over
30 per cent spent over an hour in such daily travel. This survey was made in excep¬
tional war-time conditions, and the average time taken in travelling to work may
have slightly decreased outside Greater London in spite of the continuing move¬
ment of population away from the centre of large towns. In Greater London, how¬
ever, a sample survey made in 1949 showed that the average time taken in travelling
to and from work was 88 minutes a day.
In addition, there is often a long journey from home to the main shopping centre
in both urban and rural areas. According to a sample survey made in 1946 it
averaged about 18 minutes each way, and in many rural areas took much longer. In
most areas there are, of course, a few shops much closer at hand. Most housewives
in urban areas go to the shopping centre at least once a week.
One consequence of the distance from home to work and to shops is the growth
i6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the habit of eating away from home. Food rationing restrictions during the
second world war and the early post-war years tended to increase this habit, which
has also been encouraged by the establishment of factory and office canteens and
the provision of midday meals in schools. About half the total number of school
children and many adults take some meals regularly outside their homes.
According to a sample survey made in 1947, only 6 per cent of housewives
employ any paid help, and only 1 per cent1 have a resident servant. Housewives
appear, in general, to have rather less leisure and considerably fewer periods of
continuous leisure of over one hour than other persons in Britain:
Most employees, in addition to ij or 2 days’ holiday each week and 6 statutory
public holidays a year (see p. 243), get at least one week’s continuous holiday in the
year. In fact, about half the population take at least a week’s holiday away from
home every year, mostly in July and August. Some two-thirds of these spend their
holiday by the sea in Britain. About 4! per cent of holidaymakers go abroad.
At least a quarter of the adult population is interested in playing or going to
watch outdoor sports2; the most popular are Association football and cricket. In
England alone about 23,000 football clubs—mainly amateur clubs—are affiliated to
the English Football Association, excluding another 9,000 clubs in the armed forces,
universities and schools. Some 750,000 youths and men play in weekly football
matches during the winter months, apart from those playing in informal games;
spectators at professional football matches number between one and two million
weekly. Cricket is played by children, youths and men of every walk of life,
especially in England. Attendance at first-class cricket matches is somewhat
smaller than at professional football matches, but the ‘Test’ matches with the
cricket teams of Commonwealth countries have become of nation-wide interest.
Cricket is less popular in Scotland, where golf has pride of place. Race meetings
throughout the country draw large crowds, while many other sporting events, for
instance rugby football matches in the winter months and, in the summer, tennis
tournaments, especially the annual lawn tennis championships at Wimbledon, have
their smaller but devoted public. Amateur athletic associations flourish throughout
the country, and every form of outdoor pursuit from swimming, hiking, cycling
and motoring3 to hunting, shooting and fishing has an enthusiastic following,
though many sports, such as sailing, gliding, and rock-climbing, are practised only
by relatively few keen amateurs.
Although climatic and physical conditions in Britain afford few opportunities for
ski-ing and mountaineering, numbers of people go abroad regularly for these
pursuits, and the whole nation was stirred by the news of the first ascent of Mount
Everest on 29th May 1953 by members of the British Expedition.
The spread of television has added a vast new audience of indoor spectators to
the crowds who go to watch sports and other outdoor events. In June 1954 more
than one household in five had a television set and viewers are fairly evenly distri¬
buted among all sections of the population, irrespective of income. The number of
television licences is increasing rapidly; in the year from June 1953 to June 1954
1 This estimate has been shown to be approximately correct by the analysis of house¬
holds employing servants made in the 1951 Census Sample Tables (see p. 15).
2 A recent social survey of Derby showed that half the adult population in that town,
including two-thirds of the men, were at least occasional spectators of sporting events,
and that over one-fifth, including over half those under 25 years of age, actually partici¬
pated, most of them regularly.
3 There are about 5 million motor vehicles licensed at the height of summer, of which
over 2^ million are cars and over one million are motor cycles. Many of the cars, however,
are used partly, if not primarily, for business purposes.
THE BRITISH ISLES
17
the number rose by almost a million (from 2,415,305 to 3,411,046). Some districts,
however, are still outside the regular range of the transmitters (see p. 370).
Television has caused a considerable fall in cinema attendances and has materially
affected leisure habits in many ways. The cinema remains, however, the most
popular form of indoor entertainment outside the home. A third of all adults,
including two-thirds of those under 25 years of age and one out of two school-
children go to the cinema, on average, at least once a week. Attendances at theatres
are much smaller, though most people visit them occasionally. There are only some
400 to 500 theatres in the country, compared with over 4,500 cinemas, yet the
recent survey of Derby showed that half of the adult population of that town went
to the theatre more than twice a year. About a quarter of the adult population of
Derby sometimes went to concerts, and in the country as a whole there is known
to be an enthusiastic and growing public for concerts, ballet and opera.
Dancing is popular especially with those under 25 years of age. There have been
estimated to be some 400 to 500 ballrooms in Great Britain, and dances and other
social gatherings are also often held in other halls or in club-rooms. The Derby
Survey showed that in that town nearly half the adult population, including 60 per
cent of the men, belonged to a social, sporting or cultural club and that over a third
of them visited such a club at least once a month.
One traditional social rendezvous, the public house, has maintained and even
increased its popularity, although there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness
and in consumption of alcohol per head since the nineteenth century. The public
house now attracts a very wide circle of casual customers (both men and women)
as well as many ‘regulars’, who meet for a drink and a chat, and perhaps to play
some traditional public house game such as darts. On the other hand many people,
especially the married and the elderly, spend much of their leisure at home-
reading, listening to the radio, viewing television, or pursuing hobbies. The most
widespread hobbies are practical, for example, knitting and needlework for women
and gardening for men. The standard of town and country gardens is high.
A number of people, young and old, find their main free-time interest in some
form of group activity of a serious nature, connected, for example, with the
churches, trade unionism, politics, social welfare and reform, or with cultural
pursuits such as amateur dramatics or music. People with such interests are, of
course, in a minority,1 * 3 but they constitute an important and characteristic feature
of British life and, indeed, an essential ingredient in the working of British
democracy.
1 The figures from the Derby Survey show that 8 per cent of adults in that town belong
to intellectual or cultural clubs or societies, 11 per cent are members of some political
party, 13 per cent go to church every week (although 9 out of 10 homes have a bible), and
3 per cent hold some church office.
II. GOVERNMENT AND
ADMINISTRATION
THE MONARCHY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical state, formed originally in the ninth
century by the unification of all England under a Saxon king, and later expanded by
the conquest of Wales and Ireland1 by kings of England and by the dynastic union
of the English and Scottish thrones in the person of James I of England and VI of
Scotland. The United Kingdom is also a member nation of the Commonwealth, of
which the Queen is the head.
The form of the Royal title is varied for the member countries of the Common¬
wealth to suit the particular circumstances of each. India, as a republic, owes no
allegiance to the Crown, but accepts the Queen as the symbol of the free association
of the member nations and, as such, as the head of the Commonwealth.2
Agreement was reached at a meeting of Commonwealth representatives in
December 1952 on the form of the Queen’s title in the various parts of the Common¬
wealth, and legislation was passed by the Parliaments concerned to enable the
necessary changes to be made. The Royal Title in the United Kingdom is:
‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen,
Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the other member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, the Queen is
represented by a Governor-General appointed by the Crown on the advice of the
ministers of the country concerned. The function of the Governor-General is to act
in relation to the administration of public affairs according to the constitutional
practice obtaining in his country in regard to the exercise of the powers of the
Crown. As the Queen’s representative he is wholly independent of the United
Kingdom Government; and he is sometimes a national of the country in which
he holds office. In the Dependencies—the Colonies, the Protectorates and the Trust
Territories—the Queen is represented by Governors, High Commissioners or
Residents, who are appointed by the Crown and perform the constitutional
functions of the Crown, but who have in addition varying executive and legislative
powers, and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the good
government of the countries concerned.
Each of the member nations of the Commonwealth has its own separate constitu¬
tion, governed by different laws and customs, and subject to different powers of
change. The scope of this chapter will be confined to a description of one of those
nations—namely the United Kingdom—and the machinery and processes through
which its constitution works.
Succession
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom. Its
continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in spite of
1 In 1920 the United Kingdom was diminished by the separation of the 26 counties of
southern Ireland.
2 The position of Pakistan will be similar when its new republican constitution is adopted.
18
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION jq
interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle upon which it
was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of the
Saxon king Egbert, who united all England in 829.
The permanence of the monarchy has been ascribed to the fact that the constitu¬
tion of the United Kingdom is governed by conventions rather than by formal law.
Conventions are those parts of the rules and practices under which a system of
government works, which are not part of the law of the land in the sense that viola¬
tion of them may lead to proceedings in a court of law, but which are nevertheless
indispensable to the machinery of government. Since they are based upon usage
they are not absolutely binding; and they may therefore be adapted to changing
conditions without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement, 1701, which laid it
down that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most excellent
Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’. Subsequent Succes¬
sion to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and although succession is
not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered (under a provision
of the Statute of Westminster, 1931) except by common consent of the member
nations of the Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown.
I he inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which provide
that the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the Throne, or, if there
are no sons, the daughters in order of their own seniority. When a daughter
succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant, and powers of the Crown or Royal Pre¬
rogatives2 are vested in her as fully and effectively as though she were a king. By
convention, the consort of a king takes the rank and style of her husband; but the
converse does not apply, and the constitution has never attached any special rank
or privileges to the husband of the Queen-Regnant.
Accession
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession of
another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new Sovereign is
proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the Privy Council are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and
other leading citizens of the City of London, and the High Commissioners in
London of the member nations of the Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
Coronation
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony, which has frequently been modified in
detail to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time, has remained
much the same in substance for nearly a thousand years. The service used at the
coronation of Queen Elizabeth II was derived from the service used at the corona¬
tion of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
T he coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of repre¬
sentatives of the peers, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the other Common¬
wealth countries, and of representatives of foreign States.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Acts of Government
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the supreme autho¬
rity, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in England and
Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief of all the armed
forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established Church of England.
In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process, during which many restric¬
tions on the Royal Prerogative have been imposed, these powers have changed from
being the weapon of the monarchy to being the means of giving effect to the public
will. Today, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she cannot
constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United Kingdom is
governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation during
the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers without any
necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; she opens the new
session with a speech from the throne; and she must give Royal Assent before a Bill
which has passed all its stages in both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enact¬
ment. The Queen is ‘the fountain of justice’, and in spite of the fact that the
judiciary is now completely independent of the executive ‘all jurisdictions of the
courts are either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown’. As ‘the foun¬
tain of honour’, the Queen makes appointments to peerages, knighthoods and other
honours; to all important State offices,1 including judges, officers in the armed
forces, governors, and diplomats; and to all leading positions in the established
Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are required before a
minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the realm of international
affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the State, the Queen has the
prerogative power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory, to declare war
and to make peace.
Other prerogative powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by
Royal Charter; the erection and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants
and persons of unsound mind; the administration of charities; coinage; the grant
of franchises, e.g., markets, ferries and fisheries; the right to treasure trove; and
the sole right of printing or licensing others to print the Bible, the Book of Common
Prayer and State papers.
There is clear ministerial responsibility for all these acts of government, as is
shown in the three ways in which the royal will can be constitutionally expressed:
by Order-in-Council (see pp. 32-33) made ‘by and with the advice of the Privy
Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant under the sign manual, which
generally bears the signature of one or more responsible ministers; or by Proclama¬
tion, Writs, Patents, Letters or other documents under the Great Seal affixed by
the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the smooth
working of government; for although the Queen has no personal authority and
must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be informed and con¬
sulted on every aspect of the national life to the widest possible extent. The Queen
holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other
1 In 1901 the Demise of the Crown Act provided that the holding of any such office
should not be affected by the death of the Sovereign and that no fresh appointment should
be necessary.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has been
made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the
Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or if the Heir Apparent or the Heir Presumptive
is under the age of eighteen on accession to the throne. In the event of the
Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appoint¬
ment of Counsellors of State to carry out those of the royal functions which are
delegated to them. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act, 1953—laid down
that the first potential Regent should be the Duke of Edinburgh and thereafter the
Princess Margaret and then those in succession to the throne who are of age.
Ceremonial
Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the British
Isles, and in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered outlook
of both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages are the same
today as they were many centuries ago.
The formal ceremony of Presentation still takes place, although now at the After¬
noon Presentation Parties held by the Queen, which have superseded the former
Courts. Royal marriages, the birth of royal children and royal funerals are still
marked by ancient ceremonial, although to a lesser degree than in former days.
The birthday of the Sovereign, formerly the occasion of many royal and public
functions, is today officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the
Horse Guards Parade.
State banquets still take place when a foreign monarch or head of State pays a
visit to the United Kingdom; investitures are still held at Buckingham Palace,
although today honours may be bestowed without the personal attendance of the
recipient upon the Sovereign. State processions are still an integral part of royal
ceremonial; they grace such social occasions as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as
Royal Ascot; and they add significance to the opening of Parliament, when the
Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating from
the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal ordinances,
ancient usage, established custom and the public will. The Queen’s presence at the
inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial, and charitable works of national
importance ensures nation-wide interest and support.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the House
of Lords and the House of Commons—which together represent all the elements
in the nation.
The three sections of ‘Parliament’ in this sense are outwardly separate: they are
constituted on entirely different principles; they do different work in different
places and they meet only on occasions of great symbolic significance such as the
Coronation or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making
organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate with¬
out the concurrence of all its parts, except in the case of measures passed under the
Parliament Act, 1949.1

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 23
There are other Parliaments in Britain besides the Parliament at Westminster;
for instance, the ancient legislatures of the two Channel Island Bailiwicks and
of the Isle of Man, each of which legislates on domestic matters although the
United Kingdom Parliament retains the supreme authority.1 There is also the
Northern Ireland Parliament, created to perform specific functions by an Act
of the United Kingdom Parliament.2 The Northern Ireland Parliament consists
of the Governor (as representative of the Queen), a Senate and a House of Com¬
mons, and is federal in type, certain legislative and fiscal powers being reserved to
the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Parliament at Westminster, however,
has no rival authority, and within practical limits there is nothing that it cannot
legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, the normal life of a Parliament was
fixed at five years (although it may be and often is dissolved in less than that
time), and since one Parliament cannot bind its successor (for otherwise the
succeeding Parliament would not be sovereign or supreme), each assembly
has a period of time of up to five years during which it may legislate exactly
as it chooses. During its life, it can make or unmake any law; it can destroy
by statute the most firmly established convention of the constitution; it can legalize
past illegalities and thus reverse the decisions of the courts; and it even has power
to prolong its own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years
without consulting the electorate.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice, Parliament
does not attempt to exert its supremacy in this way. In the first place, pressure of
business in recent decades has resulted in a large and increasing amount of delega¬
tion of legislative authority to ministers (see p. 30), and of specific powers to local
authorities and to public corporations of various kinds. Powers delegated in this
way could, of course, be withdrawn by Parliament, but existing demands on
parliamentary time make such a development extremely unlikely. Secondly,
the system of party government in the United Kingdom effectively discourages
Parliament from acting in too arbitrary a fashion; any Parliamentary majority
which abused its powers would almost certainly suffer severely at the hands of the
electors.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament in the sense of a Parliamentary period begins and ends with a
proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council. Such a
proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and on the other
orders the issue of writs for the election of a new one and appoints the day and
place of its meeting.
I he channel of communication between the United Kingdom Government and the
local legislatures is the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who advises the
Grown on the exercise of the Royal Prerogatives. The Queen is represented in each of
the Channel Island Bailiwicks and in the Isle of Man by a Lieutenant-Governor.
Under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, the Northern Ireland Parliament has
power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Northern Ireland in
relation to all domestic matters except those reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament
provided that such laws do not conflict with legislation passed by the United Kingdom
Parliament and extending to Northern Ireland. Matters reserved to the United Kingdom
Parliament include the postal services, the judiciary, the imposition of customs and excise
duties and of income and profits taxes, and certain other services. The Northern Ireland
Parliament has no power to legislate concerning such matters as defence and foreign rela-
tions. There are, however, 12 members representing Northern Ireland constituencies in
the House of Commons at Westminster, where they provide the representation without
which, traditionally, taxation cannot be enforced.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Formerly the death of a Sovereign involved the dissolution of Parliament, since
Parliament meets on the personal summons of the monarch. Since 1867, however,
when the Representation of the People Act of that year made the duration of Parlia¬
ment independent of the demise of the Crown, both Houses stand adjourned only
until their members have taken the Oath of Allegiance to the new Sovereign, which
occurs immediately after the Accession Council has made the order for Proclamation.
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or dissolution
is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a commission under the Great
Seal, which appoints the day and place of its meeting in a new session. The date so
appointed may be brought forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The
effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate all business until Parliament shall be
summoned again, when any measures not yet passed must be re-introduced,
unless it be decided that they are to be abandoned.
During the session, either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A
reassembly of the House can be accelerated or delayed either by proclamation or
by virtue of powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average length of a session is about 160 sitting days divided by custom into
the following periods: one from November until Christmas lasting about 30 sitting
days, one from January to Easter of about 50 sitting days, one from Easter until
Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one from Whitsun until the end of July lasting
about 40 sitting days. In addition, in recent years, the session has usually concluded
with a short period of about 10 sitting days in October, after the long summer
recess.
The House of Lords
In November 1954 the House of Lords consisted of some 800 peers (including 26
spiritual peers), as follows: (1) princes of the royal blood (who by custom take no
part in proceedings), (2) all hereditary peers (other than minors and those who had
not then applied for a writ of summons) of England and the United Kingdom,1
(3) 16 hereditary peers of Scotland elected from their own number for each Parlia¬
ment in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Union, 1707, (4) five repre¬
sentative peers of Ireland elected for life,2 and (5) several Lords of Appeal in
Ordinary appointed to perform the judicial duties of the House and holding their
seats therein for life. The spiritual peers are the archbishops and senior bishops of
the Church of England.
Temporal peerages are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Ministers
of the Crown, as a mark of distinction. All, except the judicial peerages, are
hereditary and, with the exception of the Scottish and Irish peerages, they carry
with them, for men over 21 years of age, a right to a seat in the House of Lords.
A summons to Parliament cannot be withheld from a peer who is entitled to it,
although of the peers who receive the writ of summons only about one-tenth
take any active part in the work of the House. Party politics have little effect upon
the membership of the House, which remains relatively stable over a long period
of time.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who is the Speaker
of the House. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is

The House of Commons
The House of Commons is a popular assembly elected by an almost universal
adult suffrage and containing members from all sections of the community regard¬
less of income or occupation. There are at present 625 members1 of the House of
Commons, each representing a single-member constituency.
Members of the House of Commons hold their seats during the life of a Parlia¬
ment. They are elected either at a General Election which takes place after
ar lament has been dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a
by-election which is held when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the
death or resignation of a member during the life of a Parliament. Election is decided
by secret ballot in which all United Kingdom citizens (except members of the
House of Lords) and all citizens of the Commonwealth and of the Republic of
reland who are resident in the United Kingdom are entitled to vote, provided that
they are 21 years old or over, and unless they suffer any legal incapacity to vote.
A register containing the names of all electors is prepared and published yearly by
registration officers, who, in England and Wales, are usually the clerks of local
councils and in Scotland are the lands valuation assessors. All entitled to vote
are entitled to stand for election, except undischarged bankrupts, and such persons
as clergymen of the established Churches of England, Scotland and Northern
Ireland and of the Roman Catholic Church, and certain officers of the Crown
1 1 , cuhief Parllamentary officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is
elected by the members as president of the House immediately after a new Parlia¬
ment is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, and the Deputy-Chairman, who may act as
Deputy-Speaker; both these officers are elected by the House. In addition there are
the party officials, i.e. the Government and Opposition Whips. Non-parliamentary
or permanent officers of the House, i.e. those who are not members of Parliament,
include the Clerk of the Commons, who is charged with keeping the records'
endorsing Bills, signing Orders, etc.; the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the
Speaker in the House; and the Chaplain to the Speaker.
Parliamentary Privilege
Both Houses of Parliament enjoy certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect them from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out their duties. These
privileges apply collectively to the Houses and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown for the
Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of
each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest2; freedom of speech; and the
right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House and is
exercised by the Speaker on its behalf. Further privileges include the right (rarely
exercised) to debate in secret; the right to control internal proceedings; and the
right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a
seat vacant on such grounds.
1 In November 1954 the Parliamentary Boundary Commissions made recommendations
involving an increase to 630 members.
2 This does not imply freedom from arrest for a criminal offence or for contempt of
court. ^
26
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The privileges of the House of Lords are (i) freedom from civil arrest for them¬
selves and their servants for a period of 40 days before and after a meeting of
Parliament, (2) freedom of speech, (3) freedom of access to the Sovereign for each
peer individually, (4) the right to commit for contempt, (5) the right to try and be
tried by their fellow peers for treason or felony, and (6) the right to exclude dis¬
qualified persons from taking part in the proceedings of the House. These privileges
are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House of Commons; they exist
independently without grant.
The Party System
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, and has now become an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the fact that there are three effective political
parties in the United Kingdom: Conservative, Labour and Liberal, each of which
lays rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a General Election, these
parties (and any minor parties that may be in existence at the time) may all put up
candidates for election in each of the constituencies into which the United Kingdom
is divided for the purpose. Independent candidates may also stand. As a rule, the
electorate has a choice of three candidates (Conservative, Labour and Liberal)1;
and by its choice it indicates which of the opposing policies it would like to see put
into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the majority
of votes) at a General Election forms the Government. By tradition, the leader of
the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign, usually on the
formal advice of the retiring Prime Minister; and its most outstanding members in
the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial appointments
on the advice of the Prime Minister. The larger of the two minority parties becomes
the official Opposition with its own leader and its own council of discussion or
unofficial Cabinet; while the members of any other parties or any Independents
who have been elected may support the Government or the Opposition according
to their party’s or their own view of the policy being debated at any given time.
In the General Election which took place on the 25th October 1951, 82 6 per cent
of the electorate voted, compared with 70 per cent in 1945 and 84 per cent in 1950.
The number of votes cast for the principal parties is shown in Table 3.

dates representing other political parties was very small.

The effectiveness of the party system rests to a considerable extent upon the fact
that Government and Opposition alike are carried on by agreement: that is to say
the minority agrees that the majority must govern and, therefore, accepts its deci¬
sions; and the majority agrees that the minority should criticize and, therefore, sets
time aside for that criticism to be heard. As far as is compatible with effective
government, the Prime Minister meets the convenience of the Leader of the
Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition meets the convenience of the Prime
Minister. Through the respective Whips there is a measure of agreement on the
subjects to be debated and on the time to be allowed; sometimes even on the
information to be provided and the proposed line of attack. In this way, Parliament
has a chance of hearing a full discussion on policy from every point of view.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local organiza¬
tions; inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips, who in addition to their other
functions are expected to keep their forces effective by all means in their power.
or the Government, this work is done by the Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury, the junior lords at the Treasury, and the political officers of the House-
vi0ld~the Treasurer> the Comptroller and the Vice-Chamberlain. The Opposition
Whips have no official position and are not paid from public funds, but their parlia¬
mentary duties are the same.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on forms and rules, many of which date back
to the beginning of the sixteenth century and even earlier.
Each House has its own Standing Orders, but the system of debate is much the
same in the two Houses, except that in the House of Commons thb Speaker has a
much greater measure of control. In the House of Lords, the office of Speaker
could be held by a commoner, since the Woolsack on which the Lord Chancellor
28
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sits as Speaker is technically outside the precincts of the House. In fact, the office
is always held by a peer, but it carries with it only a limited authority to check or
curtail debate. The Lords, unlike the Commons, claim the right to overrule their
Speaker forthwith on issues of procedure.
In the Commons, the Speaker has the prime duty of controlling debate. It is his
responsibility to see that parliamentary time is used to the best possible advantage
and, therefore, although he must carefully guard against abuse of procedure or any
infringement of minority rights, he has power to limit unreasonable obstruction and
his rulings on points of order cannot be challenged at the time. The Speaker has
the right to allow or disallow a closure motion (i.e. a motion to curtail or end dis¬
cussion so that the matter may be put to the vote), to check irrelevance in debate,
and to refuse to admit delaying tactics. In cases of grave and continuous disorder,
he may even adjourn the House or suspend the sitting.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number of
votes is cast, the Speaker must give the decisive vote; by regular practice he does
this in such a way as to avoid change and leave the question to be debated on
another occasion.
The Speaker has the responsibility of deciding what is a Money Bill (a Bill
dealing only with national taxation and finance, see p. 29); and who, in case of
doubt, is the Leader of the Opposition. He is also responsible for such extraneous
matters as the decision whether a prima facie case has been made against persons
accused of breach of privilege; the issue of warrants for elections to fill vacancies
in the House; and the appointment of the chairmen of the Standing Committees.
All proceedings of either House (with the exception of secret sessions) are public,
and a verbatim record is published daily in the official reports Parliamentary
Debates {Hansard).
Parliamentary Functions
The main functions of Parliament today are (a) to make laws regulating the life
of the community, {b) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make avail¬
able finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds necessary
for the services of the State, and (c) to criticize and control the Government (see
pp. 31-32). By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of
certain international treaties and agreements, in spite of the fact that the making
of treaties is a Royal Prerogative (see p. 19) exercised on the advice of the Govern¬
ment which, strictly speaking, is under no obligation to obtain Parliamentary
approval at all. In practice, there are two types of agreement about which Parlia¬
ment is consulted: treaties which could not be implemented without legislation; and
treaties of such political importance that the Government feels obliged to arrange a
debate on the matter before becoming committed. In the case of other treaties
requiring ratification it is customary to presume Parliamentary acquiescence
unless disapproval is expressed within 21 days from the date on which the treaty
was laid before Parliament.
In the past, legislation was initiated from both sides of the House; but in present-
day practice almost all Bills are brought forward by the Government in power as a
result of policy decisions taken in the Cabinet at the instigation of those Government
Departments which will be responsible for their administration when the Bills
become law. The chief exceptions are Private Bills,1 which relate solely to some
1 Such Bills begin with a petition, and promoters must give notice of their intention to
all persons and bodies whose interests may be affected by their proposals. Committees
are small, consisting of five members in the Lords and four members in the Commons.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION on
matter of individual, corporate or local interest, and Private Members’ Bills, which
are Public Bills introduced by members on their own initiative on certain days set
aside expressly for the purpose.
Bills may be introduced in either House, unless they deal with finance or repre¬
sentation, when they are always introduced in the Commons (see p. 30). As a rule
owever, no Bills likely to raise much political controversy are introduced in the
ords, as the House of Commons is considered a more suitable place of origin for
measures of that kind Bills do not necessarily always apply to the United Kingdom
as a whole Some Bills deal exclusively with Scottish matters; some apply only to
England and Wales; and others to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
1 he process of passing a Public Bill is the same in the House of Lords as in the
House of Commons: the Bill receives a formal First Reading on introduction; it is
en printed; and after a period of time (which varies between one and several
weeks depending on the type of Bill, subject matter, etc.) it may be given a Second
Reading as the result of a debate on its general merits or principles. It is then
referred either to one of the Standing Committees appointed for the purpose by the
Committee of Selection1 and composed of members of all parties in the same pro-
portion as m the whole House, or, in the case of more important measures, to the
whole House sitting in Committee if the House so decides on a motion. During the
ommittee stage, members may suggest appropriate amendments, which will be
incorporated into the Bill if the majority of the Committee agree. When this stage
is finished, the Bill is reported to the House, and a further debate takes place during
which the Committee’s amendments may be altered, additional amendments
may be suggested and incorporated and, if necessary, the Bill may be recommitted
to Committee. Finally, it is submitted for a Third Reading and, if passed, it is sent
on from the Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to the Commons (depending
on its place of origin), where it enters on the same course again.
An exception to this procedure is made in the case of Money Bills, of which the
two most important are the Finance Bill, which authorizes annual taxation and
amends existing taxation, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorizes expenditure
on the Supply Services from the Consolidated Fund.2 As a general rule, these Bills
must be introduced in the House of Commons upon Resolutions in a Committee of
the whole House and, since their purpose is to raise money for the Crown as a
means of providing for payment of the various services performed by the Crown
they may be initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
All Bills which have passed through their various parliamentary stages are sent
to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, which is automatically given either by the
Sovereign in person or (usually) by commission. The right of veto has not been
exercised since the early eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; and they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent. However,
should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would never reach the
Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—at any rate until a new
Government came into power, when it might be revived. The Lords, on the other
hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a Bill passed in the Commons from becom¬
ing law. In the normal course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons
and return it unchanged; or they amend it and return it for the consideration of
1 A body of 11 members nominated at the beginning of every session by the House in
proportion to party strength in the Commons.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

members of the other House, who frequently agree to the amendments made. They
cannot require the Commons to agree to amendments; nor can they delay a Bill
indefinitely. They have no powers in respect of Money Bills or Bills dealing with
the duration of Parliament; and since the passing of the Parliament Act, 1949, any
other Bill which has been passed by the House of Commons in two successive
sessions may be presented for Royal Assent without the consent of the Lords, pro¬
vided that a year has elapsed between the date of the Second Reading of the Bill in
the Commons and the date on which it is finally passed in that House. These
limitations to the powers of the Lords are based on the fundamental principle that
the function of the Upper House, which is a non-representative assembly, is not to
thwart the will of the people, but to use the combined experience and wisdom of its
members to ensure that that will is precisely and reasonably interpreted.
Parliamentary Committees
There are three kinds of Parliamentary Committee, all of which exist to a varying
degree to relieve the full assembly of Parliament of some of the details of its more
specialized and complex work. They are: regular Standing Committees (see p. 29)
which are concerned with current legislation; official Parliamentary Committees
such as the Committee of Privileges, the Public Accounts Committee (see p. 248)
and the Estimates Committee (see p. 249), which are concerned with particular
aspects of Parliamentary work; and a number of informal committees, consisting
of members either of one party or of all parties, such as study groups concerning
themselves with particular issues (e.g., the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee,
see p. 353), parliamentary party committees (e.g., the Labour Policy Committee)
and backbenchers’1 organizations (e.g., the 1922 Committee, a Conservative group).
These groups have grown up spontaneously and have a varying degree of influence
upon the development of Government policy.
Delegated Legislation
Delegated legislation, which is legislation not by Act of Parliament but by
Orders-in-Council, Orders, Warrants, Regulations and Rules, has been part of the
Parliamentary system for at least six hundred years. One of the earliest recorded
examples is to be found in a statute of 1337 which laid down that no wool should
be exported from England ‘till the King and his Council do otherwise provide’.
Parliament, however, made but sparing use of its power to delegate legislation
(except during a period of social, political and economic change in the second half
of the fifteenth and most of the sixteenth centuries) until the end of the nineteenth
century, when a changing conception of the part to be played by the State in the
life of the community made inroads upon Parliamentary time and thus caused the
system to be adopted on a more extensive scale. With the ever-increasing scope of
Government activity in domestic affairs during the past fifty years, pressure on
Parliamentary time has become even more acute; as a result the system of delegated
legislation has become generally accepted and there are at present few Acts of
Parliament which do not contain provisions for its use.
The advantages of the system of delegated legislation, which empowers ministers
and other authorities to regulate administrative details after a Bill has become an
Act, are said2 to be: (1) that it shortens and clarifies Bills before Parliament, thus
enabling Parliament to deal with a greater volume of business and to give fuller
attention to matters of policy and principle which are its primary concern; (2) that
1 Members who are neither ministers nor, as a rule, ex-ministers.

Law, by Sir C. T. Carr. Oxford University Press. 1942. pp. 33-34-
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 31
it encourages flexibility, for administrative details can be worked out as and when
the necessity arises ‘with greater care and minuteness, and with better adaptation
to local and other special circumstances than they possibly can be during the
passage of a Bill through Parliament’; (3) that it is invaluable in an emergency, for
it is ‘the means by which the legislature can dispense with its own deliberative
procedure and arm the executive with power to take immediate action’; and (4) that
it provides a speedy, convenient and accurate means of giving effect to the policy
of Parliament.
In order to minimize the risk—inherent in the system—that delegated legislative
powers might supersede or weaken Parliamentary government, such powers are
normally delegated to the Queen-in-Council or to authorities directly responsible
to Parliament—to Ministers of the Crown, to Government Departments for which
ministers are responsible or to organizations whose legislation is subject to con¬
firmation or approval by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament
for it. Moreover the Acts of Parliament, by which particular powers are delegated,
frequently provide for some measure of Parliamentary control over the legislation
made in exercise of them. There are cases in which an instrument1 must be
approved by Parliament or the House of Commons before it can have permanent
operation (‘affirmative resolution procedure’), or in which Parliament or the House
of Commons may secure the annulment of an instrument by a resolution passed
within a certain number of days of the instrument being laid before it (‘negative
resolution procedure’), and others in which drafts of proposed instruments must
be laid before Parliament or the House of Commons before they are made and must
then be subject either to affirmative or negative resolution procedure. The resolu¬
tion, in the case of an instrument to be annulled after it has been made, takes the
form of a Prayer to Her Majesty that the instrument be annulled (after which the
instrument may be annulled by Order-in-Council).
As a further safeguard, the principal Act generally defines the precise limits of
delegated legislative power; and if these limits are surpassed, the courts can be
moved to declare that the action taken is ultra vires. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organizations which will be affected by delegated legislation
before such legislation is made.
Parliamentary Control
Parliament’s function of controlling the Government in power is exercised in the
final analysis by the power of the House of Commons to pass a resolution of ‘no-
confidence’ in the Government, or to reject a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of confidence’; and thus
to force the Government to resign.
The financial control necessary to ensure that money shall be spent only with
the authority of Parliament and for the purposes authorized by Parliament is
described on pp. 246-50. Methods of general control are provided by:
(1) the institution of Question Time, which is a daily hour of parliamentary
time during which members may question any minister on matters for
which that minister is responsible, and may thus focus the attention of
the public on the day-to-day processes of government;
1 Almost all delegated legislation of the central government is enacted by means of
‘statutory instruments’, made in accordance with the provisions of the Statutory Instru¬
ments Act, 1946, which repealed and replaced the Rules Publication Act, 1893. Instru¬
ments of delegated legislation made under the Act of 1893 were known as ‘statutory
rules and orders’ (‘S.R. & O.’).

(2) the practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates in Committee of
Supply1 has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements of
the Government and has become an occasion, initiated by the Opposition,
for the examination2 of the Government’s administrative policy;
(3) the practice of bringing on a debate by moving the adjournment of the
House, which is permitted only if the matter is deemed by the Speaker to
be definite and urgent and to be the responsibility of the Government,
and if 40 members rise in their places to support it, or 10 members rise
and the House grants leave on a division;
(4) the right of members to raise any matter on the motion of adjournment of
either House at the end of each day’s sitting; and
(5) the power to confirm or annul ministerial Orders and Regulations (see
pp. 30-3 O-
In addition, Government policy and action are fully discussed in the important
debates which take place during the proceedings at the opening of Parliament and
in the motion for the adjournment of the House before a recess.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Before the emergence of the system of Cabinet government in the eighteenth
century, the King-in-Council or the Privy Council was the chief source of executive
power in the State. As this system developed, however, the Privy Council declined
in importance; many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its
work was handed over to newly created Government Departments. The present-
day Privy Council exists mainly to give effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are sworn of
the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council (which is
retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the
Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence in some
branch of public affairs. There are at present over 300 Privy Counsellors.
Procedure and Functions
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk to the Council. At meetings where
the Sovereign is present, three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but in practice
never less than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called
together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his
or her intention to marry.
Meetings of the Privy Council are presided over by the Lord President of the
Council, who is appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal. The duties of
the Lord President in connection with the Privy Council are to attend the
Sovereign’s person, to manage the debates in council, to propose matters from
the Sovereign at the council table and to report to the Sovereign the resolutions
of the Council thereon. Since 1660 the office of Lord President has been a political
appointment held by a member of the party in power, who is usually a leading
member of the Cabinet, free to undertake duties of a general nature.
The Privy Council is responsible for the making of Orders-in-Council, of which
there are two kinds differing fundamentally in constitutional principle: those
made in virtue of the Royal Prerogative as, for example, in the ratification of
1 See p. 247.
2 Such an examination must relate to a matter included in the Estimates.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
33
treaties; and those which are authorized by Act of Parliament and are a form of
delegated legislation (see p. 30). Members of the Privy Council attending meetings
at which Orders-in-Council are made do not thereby become personally responsible
for the policy upon which the Orders are based; this rests with the ministers in
whose Departments the draft Orders were framed, whether they are present at
the meeting or not. All Orders-in-Council must be published in the London
Gazette.1
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of Royal Proclamations—
documents whose lawful use is restricted to prerogative acts such as summoning,
proroguing or dissolving Parliament, and which are of the same validity as Acts of
Parliament.
Committees of the Privy Council
Advisory functions still belong to the committees of the Council, whose meetings
differ from the meetings of the full Council in that the Sovereign cannot constitu¬
tionally be present. These committees may be prerogative, such as the committee
which deals with matters relating to Jersey and Guernsey, and the committees for
medical research, scientific and industrial research, agricultural research and
nature conservation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and for the Scottish universities, and that
which deals with applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The Privy Council Office
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in the
Privy Council Office, which is an ancient prerogative Department under the control
of the Lord President of the Council. It is also carried out in the Office of the
Lord President of the Council.
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal on
certain legal issues arising in Australia, New Zealand, Ceylon, and in the United
Kingdom dependent territories.2 Its appellate jurisdiction derives from the prin¬
ciple of English common law which recognizes ‘the right of all the King’s subjects
to appeal for redress to the King-in-Council’ if they believe that the courts of law
have failed to do them justice.
Appeals come to it either where a right of appeal in limited categories of cases
has been specially created, e.g., by Statute, Order-in-Council or Letters Patent, or
by special leave of the Queen-in-Council on the advice of the Judicial Committee.
Appeals are heard by a board of three or five drawn from the committee, depending
on the significance of the case, the quorum being three. Invitations to sit on the
board are issued by the Lord Chancellor, who thus determines which members of
the committee shall hear particular appeals. In practice, boards are generally
selected from the Law Lords of the United Kingdom—the Lord Chancellor,
ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary—although ex-judges of
English and Scottish courts are asked to sit when business is heavy. Chief Justices
and certain judges from other Commonwealth countries have usually been sworn
of the Privy Council and may be invited to sit on the committee’s boards.

2 Until 1949, right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council also existed
in Canada, India, South Africa and Pakistan, but these countries then abolished the right.
The Republic of Ireland abolished the right by the Constitution (Amendment No. 22)
Act, 1933.

BRITAIN AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.1
Composition
The leading minister in the Government is the Prime Minister. The remaining
ministers include:
(1) ministers who are in charge of Departments, e.g., the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Home Department and
Minister for Welsh Affairs, the Minister of Health, and the Minister of
Labour and National Service;
(2) ministers who hold traditional offices to which no specified departmental
duties are attached and who are therefore free to assist the Prime Minister by
taking responsibility for any special work that may require ministerial
supervision at any time, e.g., the Lord President of the Council2;
(3) the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is in charge of the Treasury and is
responsible for economic affairs;
(4) the Lord Chancellor, who is the principal adviser of the Government on
matters relating to the law and the constitution;
(5) the Law Officers of the Crown, i.e. the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-
General, the Lord Advocate for Scotland and the Solicitor-General for
Scotland, who are also legal advisers to the Government, and are charged
with conducting certain prosecutions of unusual importance, and with
defending the rights of the Crown;
(6) Ministers of State, who are now often appointed to deputize for ministers in
charge of Departments3 where the work is particularly heavy, but who
may have no departmental duties;
(7) Parliamentary Secretaries and Under-Secretaries, whose primary function is
to relieve their senior ministers of part of the burden of their Parliamentary
duties, e.g., by taking part in debate and by answering Parliamentary
Questions. With the advice of the Departmental officials, they also assist
their ministers in supervising the administration of their Departments.
All senior ministers are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of
the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, since the
approval of that House is necessary for the general policy (and frequently for the
specific proposals) of the Government. There must, however, always be some
ministers in the House of Lords, partly because the Ministers of the Crown Act,
I937» limits the number of ministers who may sit in the Commons while receiving
salaries from the Crown, and also because every Government must be assured of
spokesmen of standing to expound and justify its intentions and its actions to the
Lords.
1 See pp. 26-27, The Party System.
2 The Lord President of the Council is responsible to Parliament for the work of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research Council, the
Agricultural Research Council, the Nature Conservancy and the Atomic Energy Authority.
3 Departments which have a Minister of State are the Foreign Office (two), the Colonial
Office and the Board of Trade. The Secretary of State for Scotland also is assisted at
ministerial level by a Minister of State.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
35
The Prime Minister
The office of Prime Minister as head of the Government has been in existence
since the middle of the eighteenth century. The office is a conventional one in that
it is not defined by statute or rule of common law, and the Prime Minister’s official
title is First Lord of the Treasury. In 1905, however, the Prime Minister was given
precedence as the fourth person in the realm after the Royal Family.1 The unique
position of authority enjoyed by the Prime Minister derives on the one hand from
his status as leader of the majority party in Parliament and on the other from his
power to submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to obtain their
resignation or dismissal individually.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Crown of the general business
of the Government; to control the Cabinet over which he presides; to exercise a
general supervision over Departments, settling Departmental differences where
possible and approving important Departmental decisions where Cabinet reference
is not required; to take the final decision in all matters of high policy affecting the
welfare of the nation, particularly as regards foreign affairs and defence; to be
prepared to speak in Parliament both on general subjects and on all the most
important Government Bills; and to answer to Parliament for all actions by the
Government, both at home and abroad. Only the Prime Minister can recommend
to the Sovereign a dissolution of Parliament if he wishes to put the Government’s
policy to the country before the normal time for a General Election has come.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include recommending the appointment
of Church of England archbishops, bishops, some senior dignitaries, and incum¬
bents of Crown livings, as well as that of the Lord Chief Justice and of the holders
of other high judicial offices, Lords Lieutenant of Counties,2 Trustees of National
Museums and Regius Professors in certain universities. He also makes recommenda¬
tions for the awards of most civil honours and distinctions.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is a conventional organ of government composed of a number of
ministers selected by the Prime Minister. Membership is not fixed by statute,
although certain ministers are always appointed; the number of members varies
nowadays between 15 and 25.
The system of Cabinet government came into being as one of the results of the
passing of the Bill of Rights in 1689. In origin it was an informal gathering of those
Privy Counsellors who were also ministers, meeting at first with, and later without,
the Sovereign. The Cabinet assumed its present shape when the accession of the
Hanoverian kings with their limited knowledge of the English language, the British
constitution and the British way of life had severely curtailed the personal participa¬
tion of the Sovereign in executive government and made it essential that a substitute
should be found.
The Cabinet is not in itself an executant in that it has no legal authority, its
decisions being valid by convention and not by law. It is designed to formulate
general policy, to bring about co-operation between the different forces of the
State without interfering with their legal independence, and to exercise general
control. Its functions3 are:
1 Above him in order of precedence are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and
the Lord Chancellor.

Committee) Cd. 9230. 1918.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(1) the final determination of the policy to be submitted to Parliament,
(2) the supreme control of the national executive in accordance with the policy
agreed by Parliament,
(3) the continuous co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of the several
Departments of State.
♦
In the performance of its functions the Cabinet makes considerable use of a
system of committees. The beginnings of this system can be traced back to the
nineteenth century and it has been developed to keep pace with government busi¬
ness during the past fifty years. The system involves the reference of any issue
either to one of the standing Cabinet committees or to an ad hoc committee com¬
posed of the ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail
and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations
for action.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its
members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose any informa¬
tion. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of Cabinet as well as of other
State papers, and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement involving dis¬
closure of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the permission of the Sovereign
through the Prime Minister. The theoretical reason for this secrecy is that a Cabinet
decision is advice to the Sovereign, whose consent is necessary before it is made
public. From a practical point of view, secrecy is essential in the interests of
unprejudiced debate, which can take place only if there is no risk of publicity for
every statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times, the Cabinet meets for about two hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is not
sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time, if a
matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet meetings, deci¬
sions are reached on the important political and social questions of the hour, and the
Cabinet settles any matters which cannot be disposed of at lower levels.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance of
documents submitted, together with a summary of the arguments and the conclu¬
sions, are recorded; and even these records have a strictly limited circulation.
The Cabinet Office
Records of the discussions of the full Cabinet and of the committees are kept by
the Secretariat of the Cabinet, or Cabinet Office, which was introduced as an
emergency institution during the first world war and has grown into an organ of
great importance in the co-ordination of policy at the highest level. The Secretariat
is responsible for the keeping of records, for providing information and advice to
ministers, and for issuing directives or promulgating decisions of the Cabinet or the
Prime Minister to the Departments concerned. It has a military side and a civil side.
There is also a Central Statistical Office which is charged with the collection,
analysis and presentation of statistics relating to the national economy.
Ministerial Responsibility
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which ministers
share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual responsibility
of ministers to Parliament for the work of their Departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the middle
37
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
°f the nmctecmh century, imposes upon Cabinet ministers the obligation to act not
as individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a united group It
does not require every minister to be present at every Cabinet meeting; and the
obligations of individual ministers may be passive rather than active when the deci¬
sion to be taken does not relate to their spheres of administrative responsibility. At
the same time, every minister should be fully informed of the subject of discussion
beforehand, so that if he has any objections he may voice them at the meeting. He
may not repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies which have
received Cabinet approval, nor may he announce policies which have not been so
approved. He must be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues and
where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy. Any minister who feels
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of his
colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere must resign. If he does not resign, he is held
to be responsible, and cannot afterwards reject criticism on the ground that he did
not personally agree with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is bound to
offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his Department means
that, as political head of that Department, he is answerable for all its acts and
omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any
injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticized in Parlia¬
ment, whether he is personally responsible or not.
Since the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in person.
Ministers who are in the House of Lords must be represented in the Commons by
political subordinates qualified to speak on their behalf, i.e. by their Parliamentary
Secretaries and Under-Secretaries. Responsibility, however, cannot be delegated
and remains with the senior minister concerned.
Ministers are expected to take all decisions relating to their spheres of administra¬
tion, unless these are of such political importance that in their opinion Cabinet
sanction is required.
If any departmental decision brings a minister under fire of criticism in Parlia¬
ment he may be upheld by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of
confidence in itself; or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose
office.
Ministerial responsibility is an effective way of bringing government under public
control. It is also a check upon incompetence, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages ministers
from making arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government Departments exist for the most part to assist ministers in the dis¬
charge of their functions by providing information and advice as a basis for the
formation of policy, and by putting that policy into effect when the necessary
legislation has been passed. Both in their advisory and executive capacities Govern¬
ment Departments may and frequently do work with and through local authorities
(see p. 60), public corporations (see pp. 118 and 124), and many Government-
sponsored organizations which, while not forming part of Government Depart¬
ments, are under varying degrees of Government control.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
38
A change of Government does not generally affect the number or functions of
Government Departments, although a radical change in policy may be accompanied
by a corresponding change in the Departments concerned. The widening scope
of Government activity has, however, led to the formation of a substantial number
of new Departments in the past half-century. A few have existed for over 200
years.
The work of some Departments, e.g., the Ministry of Labour and National
Service, covers the United Kingdom as a whole, while other Departments are
concerned only with England and Wales, or Scotland, or Northern Ireland ; some
Departments, e.g., the Ministry of Education, make special arrangements for
Welsh affairs.
This section outlines briefly the principal functions of the main Government
Departments. Since much of their work is interconnected, they are not grouped
according to the subjects with which they deal, but are arranged in alphabetical
order, except for the Treasury which, in view of its unique central position, is
placed first, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Departments which are grouped
at the end of the section.
The Treasury
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First
Lord of the Treasury (who is now invariably the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a Board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by two junior ministers, the Financial Secretary and the
Economic Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury who
is the chief Government Whip in the House of Commons (see p. 27).
The main traditional functions of the Treasury1 are the management of the
financial resources of the United Kingdom Government, the control of public
expenditure, and certain general questions concerning the staffing and organization
of the Civil Service (see pp. 56-58). It is the Department responsible for ensuring
that no more money is asked for by the spending Departments than is required
for their annual needs, and for making sure that no more money is spent than is
authorized by Parliament.
In addition, the Treasury has since 1947 been responsible for economic planning
and for co-ordinating the activities of all the Departments concerned with economic
matters, and has had special staffs for undertaking this work. The major group is
known as the Central Economic Planning Staff. This group is charged with the
task of achieving a comprehensive economic policy for the nation, and of co-ordinat¬
ing departmental policies. A separate group co-ordinates the policies of Departments
in matters connected with oversea trade and the balance of payments.
Attached to the Treasury is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, in which
Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
For further information on the Treasury see pp. 248-9.
The Admiralty
The Board of Admiralty has been in existence since 1708. It is served by the
Admiralty Divisions of the Naval Staff and the Admiralty Departments. The
Divisions of the Naval Staff deal with operational and technical policy. The
Departments deal with the manning of the ships and establishments; the provision

Ministry of Finance (see p. 54) which works closely with the Treasury.

of warships and other vessels, aircraft, weapons and munitions, stores, fuel and
other goods, equipment and reserve forces; the general organization and administra¬
tion of the Fleets and establishments; and the accounting and administration of the
moneys voted by Parliament for these purposes.
The Admiralty is also responsible for the Government’s economic policy in the
shipbuilding and ship repair industries and certain minor allied industries.
For further information on the Admiralty see pp. 95 and 349-50.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries was established in 1899, and was
converted into the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries by statute in 1919. Its main
functions are to secure the best possible output of food and to improve the general
efficiency of the agricultural, horticultural and fishing industries of England and
Wales1; and it is responsible, in association with the Department of Agriculture for
Scotland and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture, for the settling of
general agricultural production programmes and prices of the main farm products.
The Ministry is also concerned with the encouragement, and if necessary the
enforcement, of proper standards of husbandry and estate management; with the
supply and in some cases the distribution of farmers’ requisites such as feeding-
stuffs, machinery, fertilizers and seeds; with all forms of land drainage; with the
improvement of rural services such as farm buildings, water supplies and electricity;
with the supply of agricultural labour and the enforcement of agricultural wages
awards; with the provision of technical advice on all aspects of food production;
with agricultural education and agricultural and fisheries research; with marketing
schemes; with the effect of international trade negotiations on the agricultural
industries of the United Kingdom; and with the international aspects of sea
fishing, the regulation of whaling, the regulation of freshwater fishing and inshore
fisheries.
Other measures for which the Ministry is responsible are designed to improve
the quality of livestock, and to control and eradicate animal and plant diseases and
pests. The Ministry is also responsible for the Ordnance Survey and for Kew
Gardens.
In October 1954 it was announced that the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
and the Ministry of Food were to be amalgamated to form a new Department
concerned with the provision and distribution of food, whether from home or
abroad. During the process of amalgamation the two portfolios would be held by
one minister. When the amalgamation, which might take about six months, was
completed, the responsibilities hitherto discharged by the Minister of Food in
relation to Scotland would be transferred to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
For further information on the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries see pp.
129-148.
The Air Ministry
The Air Council was established in 1918 under the presidency of the Secretary
of State for Air to provide for the growing importance of aircraft in warfare by
taking over responsibility for the administrative control of the Royal Air Force.
The functions of the Air Ministry include strategic planning; the organization of
general and technical training; the organization and control of aeronautical inspec-
1 For the operational control of epidemic diseases of animals, e.g., foot-and-mouth
disease, and for the control of plant diseases and pests the Ministry’s responsibilities also
extend to Scotland.

tion and of the provision, maintenance and repair of equipment; the supervision of
the finance and contracts of the Air Force; the acquisition of lands required for air
force purposes; and the appointment, promotion, posting and payment of all
members of the Royal Air Force.
The Meteorological Office operates the State weather service. It has existed since
1854, at first under the Board of Trade, then as a self-contained unit supervised
by a Meteorological Committee (which was directly responsible to the Treasury for
the administration of the parliamentary grant-in-aid) and since 1920 as a part of
the Air Ministry. The Office provides meteorological services for the general
public, Government Departments, the Armed Forces and civil aviation, as well
as organizing meteorological observations in the United Kingdom and certain of
its Dependencies. In addition, the Office is responsible for the collection, publica¬
tion and distribution within the United Kingdom and its Dependencies of meteoro¬
logical information from all parts of the world. Research is undertaken at Dunstable
(Bedfordshire), Harrow (Middlesex) and London, and at observatories at Kew
(Surrey), Eskdalemuir (Dumfriesshire) and Lerwick (in the Shetland Islands).
For further information on the Air Ministry see p. 102.
The Colonial Office
The Colonial Office is the Department of the United Kingdom Government
which deals with the affairs of the great majority of the non-selfgoverning countries
of the Commonwealth. At the head of the Colonial Office is the Secretary of State
for the Colonies, who is the Minister responsible to Parliament for the general
administration of those territories. The main functions of the Colonial Office
are to convey to Colonial Governments the views and wishes of Her Majesty’s
Government on broad matters of policy; to see that the interests of Colonial
Governments and peoples are safeguarded and promoted; to provide, through
its staff of professional advisers and with the help of Advisory Committees com¬
posed of men and women eminent in many fields, guidance to Colonial Governments
on a wide range of matters; and to undertake expert services of many kinds,
including the allocation of moneys for development purposes under the Colonial
Development and Welfare Acts and the provision of administrative and professional
staff for the Oversea Civil Service, which replaced the former Colonial Service on
the xst October 1954 (see below). Other functions of the Colonial Office are the
care of Colonial students in the United Kingdom and the provision of information
services on Colonial affairs for the United Kingdom, for other Commonwealth
and foreign territories, and for the territories themselves.
The Colonial Office does not directly administer the non-selfgoverning terri¬
tories with which it deals. Each of these has its own administration and an increasing
measure of autonomy.
Her Majesty's Oversea Civil Service. Members of this Service are employed in
the public service of the territory in which they serve and are paid by the Govern¬
ment of that territory. The Service merges the former administrative and profes¬
sional branches of the Colonial Service. Its members are eligible for employment
in any post which the Secretary of State for the Colonies is requested or authorized
to fill and may be considered, as opportunity offers, for posts in Commonwealth
or foreign territories for which the United Kingdom Government may be invited
to recommend candidates. Recruitment into this Service is undertaken in the
United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries when suitably qualified
local candidates are not available for appointment to the territorial public service.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
41
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations are appointed
by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to act as commercial and financial agents
in the United Kingdom for the Governments of the territories for which he is
responsible. They also act by special arrangement for other Governments and
bodies.
The Commonwealth Relations Office
The Commonwealth Relations Office is the main channel of communication
between the United Kingdom Government and the Governments of the other
Members of the Commonwealth—Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,
India, Pakistan and Ceylon. Through it, consultation and exchange of informa¬
tion takes place with the External Affairs Departments of those Commonwealth
countries, either directly or through United Kingdom High Commissioners, on
all subjects of mutual interest—foreign affairs, defence co-operation, economic
and other matters. Where foreign policy is concerned, the Office works in close
association with the Foreign Office.
The Commonwealth Relations Office is also responsible for the conduct of
relations with the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland1 and for the administration
of the High Commission Territories—Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate
and Swaziland.
The Commonwealth Relations Office was established in 1947, replacing the
Dominions Office (set up in 1925). In the same year the conduct of relations with
India and Pakistan was transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office from
the India Office, which was abolished, and in 1948 the Office assumed similar
responsibility in respect of Ceylon, which in that year became an equal member of
the Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth Relations Office remains the Department responsible for
the conduct of relations between the United Kingdom Government and the
Government of the Irish Republic, which left the Commonwealth in 1949.
The Customs and Excise Department
Commissioners to collect the Customs and the Excise revenues were first
appointed by the Long Parliament in 1643 (although after the Restoration the
older method of collection through private contractors was again resorted to for
a time). The two branches of the Revenue remained distinct until 1909, when
they were amalgamated under Commissioners of Customs and Excise. The
primary work of the Customs and Excise Department is to collect and administer
the duties of Customs and Excise imposed from time to time in the annual Finance
Acts or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on
any matters connected with them. The Department is also responsible for
preventing and detecting evasion of the Revenue laws, including smuggling and
illicit distillation.
In addition to its revenue work the Department undertakes a wide range of
non-revenue agency work for other Departments, e.g., the enforcement of prohibi¬
tions and restrictions on the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods,
exchange currency control, and the compilation of United Kingdom oversea trade
statistics from Customs import and export documents.
1 The Federation comprises the three territories of Southern Rhodesia, Northern
Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Federal matters and Southern Rhodesian territorial matters
are dealt with by the Commonwealth Relations Office, but territorial matters concerning
Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland are dealt with by the Colonial Office.

The Ministry of Defence
The Ministry of Defence was formally constituted in January 1947 following
the passing of the Ministry of Defence Act, 1946. The Act charges the Minister
with the responsibility for ‘the formulation and general application of a unified
policy relating to the armed forces of the Crown as a whole and their requirements’.
He carries out this responsibility in accordance with general defence policy laid
down by the Cabinet.
In addition to its main function of co-ordinating the policies and requirements of
the three armed Services, the Ministry is responsible for the administration of
certain inter-service organizations, such as Amphibious Warfare Headquarters,
the Joint Intelligence Bureau and the Imperial Defence College.
For further information on the Ministry of Defence see p. 88.
The Ministry of Education
The Ministry of Education was established in 1944 to take over the powers and
duties previously exercised by the Board of Education (1899-1944) in regard to
the promotion of the education of the people of England and Wales and of the
progressive development of institutions devoted to that purpose. The Ministry
exercises this function in co-operation with the local education authorities—the
councils of the counties and of the county boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
the provision in their areas of adequate facilities for all forms of education. On
professional matters, contact with the local education authorities is maintained
through Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Schools, organized in regional divisions
throughout England and Wales for its work of inspection, liaison and advice. A
separate Welsh Department of the Ministry deals with education in Wales.
The Ministry is concerned with the development of primary, secondary and
further education, including vocational education and education for leisure and
the social and physical training of young people. It deals with the supply, training
and superannuation of teachers; the building of new schools and other institutions;
the school health service; the special educational treatment of handicapped
children; and the provision of school meals and milk. It is responsible for the award
of State scholarships and other awards for university students; for the administra¬
tion of certain museums; and for the maintenance of educational relations with
the countries of the Commonwealth, with foreign countries, and with the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
The Imperial Institute, which was founded in 1893, has since 1949 been the
responsibility of the Minister of Education. The Institute houses permanent
exhibitions of the peoples and products of the Commonwealth, shows films on
Commonwealth subjects, and does much educational work in co-operation with
the schools. It also arranges lectures and conferences and has study and recreational
accommodation for Commonwealth students. The Institute is financially dependent
on an endowment fund and on grants from the United Kingdom and other
Commonwealth Governments.
For further information on the Ministry of Education see pp. 310-11.
The Ministry of Food
The Ministry of Food, which developed from the Food (Defence Plans) Depart¬
ment of the Board of Trade, was established as a separate Ministry in 1939. With
the end of rationing and many other war-time controls it is now to be amalgamated
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 43
with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (see p. 39), with which it shares
responsibility for implementing the farm price guarantees. The Ministry of Food
is also responsible for administering deficiency payments schemes for cereals and
livestock, support prices for eggs and potatoes, and the remaining food subsidies.
1 he Umted Kingdom’s balance of payments problems make it necessary for the
Ministry to keep a general oversight of food imports and the Ministry has addi¬
tional responsibilities where long-term contracts with oversea suppliers remain in
force. The Ministry’s other functions include food and drugs legislation, welfare
foods (see p. 306) and nutritional policy, disposal of stocks, food defence plans and
relations with various international bodies.
The Foreign Office
The Foreign Office, which is the headquarters of Her Majesty’s Foreign Service,
first became a separate Department of State in 1782. The Minister in charge of
the Foreign Office, and responsible to Parliament for the conduct of foreign
affairs and for the direction and operation of the Foreign Service, is styled Her
Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
The Foreign Office acts as a channel of communication between the Government
of the United Kingdom and the Governments of foreign States, either through
the representatives of foreign States in the United Kingdom or through Her
Majesty s representatives abroad, for the discussion and negotiation of all matters
falling within the field of international relations, including the drawing up of inter¬
national treaties and agreements. It also provides the means by which the United
Kingdom Government is represented in the United Nations and on other inter¬
national bodies and is kept informed of developments in foreign countries; by
which British subjects and interests abroad are protected and trade promoted; and
by which British policy is explained to the Governments and peoples of foreign
countries. The questions dealt with by the Foreign Office are primarily of a
political nature, but they also include many other matters such as questions of
nationality, the issue and renewal of passports, and the immunities and privileges
of foreign diplomatic representatives.
The Foreign Office is staffed by members of the Foreign Service which, as a
separate and self-contained Service of the Crown formed in 1943 as a result of the
amalgamation of the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service with the Consular
and Commercial-Diplomatic Services, provides an interchangeable staff for
service both at home and at United Kingdom diplomatic missions and consular
posts abroad.
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission was established under the Forestry Acts, 1919—47,
to promote the interest of forestry, the development of afforestation, and the produc¬
tion and supply of timber in Great Britain; the Forestry Act, 1951, places responsi¬
bility on the Forestry Commissioners for the maintenance of reserves of growing
trees, through a system of licensing of felling.
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are responsible for forest policy in Great Britain.
For further information on the Forestry Commission see pp. 150 and 350.
The Ministry of Fuel and Power
The Ministry of Fuel and Power was established in 1942, when it absorbed the
former Mines and Petroleum Departments of the Board of Trade and the Board’s
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
44
functions in relation to gas and electricity. It was made permanent by the Ministry
of Fuel and Power Act, 1945.
The Ministry has the general duty of ensuring the effective and co-ordinated
development of fuel and power supplies in Great Britain, and of promoting
economy and efficiency in their distribution and consumption. The business of
producing and distributing gas and electricity and of producing coal is operated
by the boards of the three nationalized industries, whose members are responsible
to the Minister on policy issues. The distribution of coal and coke is carried out,
under Ministry control, largely by private concerns. The Ministry is also responsible
for Government relations with the petroleum industry.
The Acts and Regulations governing the safety and health of workers in
and about coal mines, metalliferous mines and quarries are administered by the
Safety and Health Division of the Ministry, which includes the Inspectorate of
Mines. The Ministry is responsible for the general co-ordination of fuel research,
and the Chief Scientist’s Division itself conducts or arranges for scientific re¬
search on specific projects and on matters affecting safety and health in mines and
quarries.
The General Register Office
The General Register Office, which is under the Minister of Health for purposes
of parliamentary control, is responsible under the Registrar General for the
administration of the system of civil registration in England and Wales, for the
preparation of statistics and reports relating to population, fertility, births,
marriages, diseases and deaths, and for making arrangements for the periodic
census of the population.
The Ministry of Health
The Ministry of Health, created in 1919 to take over the powers and duties
previously attaching to the Local Government Board (established in 1871) and the
National Health Insurance Commission (formed in 1912), assumed in 1920 the
responsibilities in connection with mental illness formerly attached to the Home
Office.
Twice since 1944 there has been a transfer of some of the Ministry’s main
responsibilities to newly created Departments—in 1945 those in respect of national
health insurance and contributory pensions to the Ministry of National Insurance
(now the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance), and in 1951 those in respect
of housing, water and sewerage services, and the supervision of local government to
the Ministry of Local Government and Planning (now the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government).
The main function of the Ministry of Health is now the administration of the
National Health Service in England and Wales under the National Health Service
Acts. The Ministry is also responsible in England and Wales for supervising the
work of local authorities under certain sections of the Public Health Acts and
providing for the care of the aged, infirm, blind, deaf and dumb and other handi¬
capped persons under the National Assistance Act, 1946.
On the amalgamation of the Ministry of Pensions with the Ministry of National
Insurance in 1953, the medical and surgical treatment of war pensioners—including
the management of hospitals and the supply of artificial limbs, surgical appliances
and invalid vehicles—hitherto the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions, was
transferred in England and Wales to the Ministry of Health (and in Scotland to
the Department of Health for Scotland). The responsibility of the Ministry of
Pensions for the medical treatment of war pensioners in the Channel Isles and
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 45
the Isle of Man and of those residing in the Irish Republic was also transferred to
the Ministry of Health on that date.
For further information on the Ministry of Health see pp. 301-3 and 351.
The Home Office
The Home Office was created in 1782. Its head is the Secretary of State for the
Home Department (the Home Secretary), who is the principal Secretary of State
and is entrusted with all the responsibilities of national administration which have
not been especially assigned by law or convention to the remaining Secretaries of
State or Ministers. The Home Secretary is also the channel of communication
between the Sovereign and his or her subjects, and between the United Kingdom
Government and the Governments of Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man. In the Government formed in October 1951 the Home Secretary
was appointed Minister in charge of Welsh affairs; at the same time a second
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department was appointed for Welsh
affairs.
The chief matters with which the Home Office deals are: the maintenance of law
and order; the efficiency of the police service; the treatment of offenders, including
juvenile offenders; the efficacy of the probation service; the organization of
magistrates courts; legislation on criminal justice; the efficiency of the fire service;
the care of children by local authorities and voluntary organizations; the regulation
of the employment of children and young persons; the control and naturalization

The Ministry of Housing and Local Government
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government was constituted in January
I9SI» under the title of Ministry of Local Government and Planning, to take over
the housing and local government functions of the Ministry of Health and the
planning functions of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning (i943~i95i). It
was renamed the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in November 1951.
It is the Department generally responsible for local government, the loan-
sanctioning authority for most purposes for which local authorities require to
borrow money, and the main link between local authorities and the central
Government.
The Ministry exercises powers in regard to housing, water, sewerage and other
services administered by local authorities in England and Wales. In regard to these
services, the position, broadly, is that the Minister is responsible to Parliament
{a) for securing, so far as intervention by the central Government is necessary, the
performance of duties laid upon local authorities by Parliament, whether this
obligation is to be discharged by the aid of grants from national funds or not;
{b) for encouraging the exercise of powers given to local authorities in regard to
such services whether by grants paid out of national funds or otherwise; and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
46
(c) for communicating with local authorities in regard to difficulties and complaints
concerning any local authority services which may be brought to the Minister’s
notice.
As the central Housing Authority under the Housing Act, 1936, the Minister
has supervisory responsibilities regarding the administration of the statutes
relating to housing and the national housing programme; and he keeps in close
touch with the local authorities through his officers in ten regions covering England
and an officer in ^Vales. Local authority proposals for dealing with areas of unfit
houses (slum clearance) are also submitted to the Minister and he has important
functions in relation to the problem of overcrowding.
The town and country planning work of the Ministry includes the framing and
execution of the national policy with respect to the use and developrrjent of
land for the purpose of achieving the best use of land in the public interest. The
responsibilities of the Minister in this respect include confirmation of the acquisi¬
tion and disposal of land by local authorities; and the payment of grants, for
planning purposes, in respect of certain cases of acquisition, clearing and compensa¬
tion. The Minister also has responsibilities in connection with the establishment
and work of the Development Corporations of the New Towns, and with the
National Parks Commission.

see pp. 321, 329, 332 and 351.
The Central Office of Information
The Central Office of Information was established in 1946 as the successor to the
war-time Ministry of Information. It is a common service agency for the production
of information and publicity material and the supply of general publicity services
required by Government Departments. Both for the home and oversea ministerial
Departments it produces and distributes books, pamphlets, magazines, films,
exhibitions, photographs and other visual material. It conducts all official press and
poster advertising except that of the National Savings Committee, carries out social
surveys, and distributes Departmental news to the Press and the BBC. For the
oversea Departments, it supplies British information posts with a daily service of
news-background and comment and with a comprehensive reference service.

Ministers whose Departments it serves are responsible for the policy expressed
in its work.
The Board of Inland Revenue
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax and
surtax, profits tax, stamp duty, death duties, and certain other direct taxes of lesser
importance; and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected
with them. The Board is also responsible for the valuation of real property for
various purposes such as compensation for compulsory purchase, local authority
rates and death duties.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service
The office of Minister of Labour was created by the New Ministries and
Secretaries Act, 1916, which provided for the transfer to the Ministry of Labour
of certain duties of the Board of Trade. Under the Minister of National Service
Order, 1939, the title of the Ministry was changed to the Ministry of Labour
and National Service and the offices of Minister of Labour and of National Service
are held by the same Minister. The principal functions of the Ministry of

The Law Officers’ Department
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales1 (the Attorney-General
and the Solicitor-General) are the legal advisers to the Crown and to all Govern¬
ment Departments and appear in Court on their behalf in cases of importance.
In such cases the Law Officers are assisted by Junior Counsel to the Treasury.

of the English Bar, are generally, though not invariably, political and the office
holders change with the Government.
The Attorney-General has a number of important functions in regard to the
administration of justice and he has wide powers in connection with the enforce¬
ment of the criminal law. The Director of Public Prosecutions acts under his
superintendence and is subject to his directions. The Attorney-General is the

The Post Office
The Post Office was set up in the seventeenth century to take over the responsi¬
bility for carrying letters, which was previously attached to the Crown. The
Minister at its head is the Postmaster-General. Its work is mainly concerned with
the operation of the inland postal, telegraph and telephone services and, in
co-operation with other countries and interests, of the oversea postal and
telecommunications services. It also undertakes certain banking functions, including
the operation of the Post Office Savings Bank and the issue of money orders, and it
acts as an agent for many other Government Departments in the collection of revenue
(e.g., by the sale of broadcast receiving and other licences and by the sale of stamps
for National Insurance contributions) and the payments of grants and allowances,
such as National Insurance payments, retirement and certain other pensions and
family allowances.
The Postmaster-General is the minister responsible to Parliament for broad
questions of national policy concerning sound broadcasting and television services.
The Engineering Department of the Post Office carries out a considerable
volume of scientific research and technical development relating to telephone,
telegraph and radio systems.
For further information on the Post Office see pp. 220-5, 257 and 351.

The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was set up as a Depart¬
ment of the Privy Council in 1916. It accounts for its own Vote in the Estimates and
is responsible to Parliament through the Lord President of the Council.
The work of the Department covers research (except defence research) in all
branches of natural science except medicine and atomic energy, and in all industries
except agriculture, fishery and forestry. Its primary functions are to undertake
research in the national interest for the benefit of the community and to meet the
requirements of other Departments; to encourage research and the application
of scientific knowledge in industry; and to encourage fundamental research at
universities and elsewhere, and the maintenance of an adequate supply of trained

The Ministry of Supply
The present Ministry of Supply was formed in 1946 by the amalgamation of
the war-time Ministries of Supply and of Aircraft Production.
The primary functions of the Ministry are to furnish supplies, which include
complete atomic weapons, to the armed forces; to undertake research on, and the
design and development of, equipment for these forces, principally for the Army
and Royal Air Force, but including aircraft, vehicles, some guns and ammunition

ment, welfare, housing and transport in connection with these organizations.
The Board of Trade
The Board of Trade, which is headed by a President, assisted by a Minister of
State who is specially concerned with oversea trade, and by a Parliamentary
Secretary, was formally constituted by an Order-in-Council of 1786. It has a general
responsibility in relation to the United Kingdom’s commerce, industry and oversea
trade, and carries the central responsibility among Government Departments for

other countries, including international commodity policy and the commercial
aspect of relations with international bodies; general import and export policy;
policy on the United Kingdom protective tariffs; consumer protection, including,
for example, policy on price control, resale price maintenance, monopolies and
restrictive practices and merchandise marks; matters affecting industrial produc¬

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 5!
industry, such as the British Standards Institution, the British Institute of Manage-
ment the British Travel and Holidays Association, the Council of Industrial Design
and the National Research Development Corporation.
In addition, the Board is the ‘production department’ (see p. 122) for all industries
and raw materials which are not the concern of other Departments, and is respon¬
sible for the management and custody of strategic stockpiles of materials.
For further information on the Board of Trade see pp. 279, 284-5 and 329.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation
In 1953 the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Civil Aviation were
amalgamated. This amalgamation was foreshadowed in November 1951, from
which time the two offices of Minister of Transport and Minister of Civil Aviation
were held by the same Minister.
The Ministry of Transport, established in 1919 ‘for the purpose of improving
the means of, and the facilities for, locomotion and transport’, assumed also, in 1941,
the responsibility for merchant shipping formerly exercised by the Mercantile
Marine Department of the Board of Trade.
The Ministry of Civil Aviation was established in 1945 to organize, carry out
and encourage measures for the development of civil aviation, for the promotion
of air safety and efficiency, and for research on air navigation.
The powers and duties of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation relate to
the following aspects of inland transport and merchant shippings railways; inland
waterways; roads, bridges and ferries, and the vehicles they carry; harbours, docks,
piers and river conservancy; national and international shipping policy; ships, their
masters, officers and men; safety of life at sea; navigation (including pilotage, light¬
houses, and other aids to safety in navigation); wreck and salvage; and the Coast¬
guard Service. The Ministry is the highway authority for trunk roads and is
responsible for providing and operating troopships.
In civil aviation matters, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation may give
general directions to the publicly owned airline corporations on matters affecting
the national interest. He also approves associate arrangements between airline
corporations and independent air transport companies for the operation of
scheduled services.
General civil aviation responsibilities include: the regulation of civil flying; air
safety, the provision, administration and equipment of State-controlled aerodromes
and other ground services; the negotiation of international air transport agreements;
the registration of aircraft; and the licensing of aircrew and aircraft maintenance
personnel.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation has two joint Parliamentary
Secretaries.

pp. 190, 196, 208, 210, 216 and 351.
The War Office
The office of Secretary of State for War was established in 1854 as a preliminary
to abolishing the office of Secretary of State at War, which had been in existence
since the beginning of the century. In 1904 the Army Council was constituted
on the model of the Board of Admiralty, with the Secretary of State as president
and a mixed membership o 1 military and civil personnel.
The War Office is responsible for the administrative control of the Army, includ¬
ing appointments, promotion, postings and payment, and its functions include
the planning of operations and training; the collection and sifting of military
52

information; the framing of policy on the composition, weapons and equipment
of the Army; the determination of financial and labour policy connected with
the Army; and the supervision of War Office civilian staffs both at home and
abroad.
For further information on the War Office see p. 98.
The Ministry of Works
The Ministry of Works, previously known as His Majesty’s Office of Works, was
established under its present title in 1943. Its main functions are: the provision of
accommodation for Government Departments (including public buildings over¬
seas), either by the design and erection of new buildings (including Government
research laboratories, factories, etc.) or the leasing and adaptation of existing
buildings ; the maintenance of this accommodation; the design, purchase, supply
and maintenance of furniture and equipment for Government Departments and
certain other bodies, and the supply of fuel, household articles and stores; the
maintenance of, and advisory services in connection with, ancient monuments and
historic buildings, and the administration of the Historic Buildings and Ancient
Monuments Act, 1953; the maintenance of certain Royal Palaces; and the manage¬
ment and maintenance of the Royal Parks. The Ministry is also responsible for
assisting the production and distribution of certain building materials and fitments;
for the supervision of the national building programme and the allocation of
certain materials among various users; and for the review of research and develop¬
ment work in connection with building requirements and the communication of
the results to industry.
By a special arrangement, announced by the Prime Minister in November I953>
the Minister of Works has been made responsible for answering questions in the
House of Commons concerning atomic energy, since the responsible Minister—
the Lord President of the Council—is a member of the House of Lords.
For further information on the Ministry of Works see pp. 321 and 351.
SCOTLAND
The first Secretary for Scotland was appointed in 1885 in recognition of the fact
that Scotland required a separate system of administration from that of England and
Wales. In 1926, all the powers and duties attached to the office were transferred
by the Secretaries of State Act to a principal Secretary of State.
The functions of the Secretary of State, who is assisted at ministerial level by a
Minister of State, three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries and the Scottish Law
Officers, are discharged by four main administrative Departments of equal status,
each under a Secretary responsible to the Secretary of State for the discharge of
the duties of the Department. The day-to-day administration of the Departments
is conducted in Edinburgh, but each Department has representatives in London
for liaison and Parliamentary duties. This London office is generally known as
the Scottish Office, a term also used to describe the whole system of Scottish
administration.
The four main Scottish Departments are the Scottish Home Department, the
Department of Health for Scotland, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Department of Agriculture for Scotland.
The Scottish Home Department
The Scottish Home Department was set up in 1939 to take over the work that
had been undertaken previously by the Secretary of State’s Office, and by the
Fishery Board for Scotland and the Prisons Department for Scotland.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ^3
In the field of law and order, the Department is concerned with the police,
probation and remand home services, criminal justice, legal aid and the services
needed by the courts; it is directly responsible for the administration of prisons
and Borstal institutions.
The Department is the central Department in Scotland for the fire service and
civil defence; for the children’s service; and for legislation concerning shops,
theatres, cinemas and licensed premises. Licensed premises in the State Manage¬
ment Districts1 are directly maintained by the Department.
Other functions of the Department are: general duties in connection with the
structure and finance of local authorities, including valuation and rating and the
administration of the Exchequer equalization grants; and the oversight and protec¬
tion of the Scottish inshore, deep-sea and freshwater fisheries. The Department
is also closely concerned, in co-operation with the Board of Trade and other United
Kingdom Departments, with Scottish economic development, including the work
of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and the rehabilitation of the
Highlands generally.
The Department of Health for Scotland
The Department of Health for Scotland is responsible for the general supervision
of the National Health Service in Scotland; for the central administration of the
Housing (Scotland) Acts and for the supervision of the house-building programme
and the distribution of grants to local authorities for housing purposes; and for the
control, under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts, of the use of
land and the establishment of new towns under the New Towns Act.
The Department is also responsible for supervising the administration of various
environmental services, e.g., water supplies and sewerage ; and welfare services,
e.g., the care of the aged and handicapped persons; and for the medical and
surgical treatment of war pensioners in Scotland (including hospital services and
the supply and repair of artificial limbs, surgical appliances and invalid chairs).
The Scottish Education Department
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for supervising the admini¬
stration of the Education (Scotland) Acts, for guiding the development of public
education in Scotland in all its forms, for supervising the training of teachers, for
issuing teachers’ certificates and administering the Teachers’ Superannuation
Scheme, for controlling the distribution of Exchequer grants-in-aid of educational
expenditure, for conducting the annual examination for the Scottish Leaving
Certificate, and for exercising general supervision over Approved Schools and
over the administration of the Royal Scottish Museum.
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland is the successor of the Board of
Agriculture which was established in 1912. The Department is responsible in
Scotland for the management of agricultural property owned by the Secretary of
State; for the administration and finance of various instructional, advisory and
research services provided by agricultural colleges and research institutes; for the
administration of subsidies and other services in connection with food production,
the use of land and the economics of the agricultural industry; for the administra¬
tion of agricultural improvement schemes and of labour, machinery and supply
services; and for the protection of agricultural interests generally.

Minor Departments
In addition to the main Departments, there are a number of minor Scottish
Departments, including the Department of the Registrar General for Scotland,1 all
of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the Secretary of State.
There are also the Scottish branches of the United Kingdom Departments under
the direction of Controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution
in Scotland of the policy and procedure of their Departments is in accordance
with Scottish conditions and needs.
Legal Departments
The Law Officers for Scotland are the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General.
The Lord Advocate is in administrative control of two Departments: The Lord
Advocate1 s Department, which is responsible for drafting Scottish legislation,
providing legal advice on Scottish questions for other Departments, and assisting
the Scottish Law Officers in certain of their legal duties; and The Crown Office,
which exercises the powers of the Lord Advocate in relation to criminal
proceedings.
NORTHERN IRELAND
There are a number of separate Departments for Northern Ireland, which are
controlled by the Northern Ireland Parliament. Most of these have functions in
Northern Ireland analogous to those performed for England and Wales by the
United Kingdom Departments of the same name—the Northern Ireland Ministries
of Home Affairs, Education and Agriculture; the Northern Ireland Assistance
Board; and the Exchequer and Audit Department for Northern Ireland. Other
Northern Ireland Departments cover activities which in Great Britain are divided
between several Departments. These Northern Ireland Departments include the
Ministries of Finance, Commerce, Health and Local Government, and Labour and
National Insurance.
The Ministry of Finance
In addition to acting as Treasury to the Government of Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Finance is responsible for administrative work in connection with the
erection and maintenance of public works and buildings; for Government valuation
and survey; for land registry, the registry of deeds, and certain duties in connection
with land purchases; for the reception and preservation of public records; for the
work of the Registrar-General; for the control of Government publications; for
the control and administration of charitable donations and bequests; and for the
control of borrowings.
Attached to the Department is the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, in which
Government Bills are prepared for introduction into Parliament.
The Ministry of Commerce
In addition to its commercial intelligence work, and its work in connection with
industrial production and the development of new, and the expansion of existing,
industries, the Department is responsible for the business of the Government in
relation to electricity and gas undertakings; roads and bridges and inland public
transport; motor vehicles and road traffic; railways; harbours and inland waterways;
fisheries; the development of the tourist traffic; the regulation and inspection of
1 The General Registry Office.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 55
mines and quarries; mineral development; scientific development; the registration
of companies and trade unions; and the administration of the Assurance Companies
Acts and the Industrial Assurance (Northern Ireland) Act, 1924. The Ministry
also performs functions delegated by the Ministry of Fuel and Power (Whitehall)
relating to the distribution of coal and other solid fuels.
The Ministry of Health and Local Government
In addition to its work in connection with the National Health Service, the
Department is responsible for the central administration of local government
services.
The Ministry of Labour and National Insurance
The Ministry is responsible for the administration of the Factories Acts and other
legislation connected with industrial health and welfare; for the promotion of
joint organizations for the settlement of industrial questions and of machinery of
conciliation in industrial disputes; for the administration of local employment
offices and the machinery for dealing with employment questions of all kinds; for
the administration of the National Insurance and the National Insurance (Industrial
Injuries) Act, and of the Family Allowances Act; and for carrying out certain
statutory functions in connection with the National Assistance Scheme in conjunc¬
tion with the National Assistance Board for Northern Ireland.
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose remunera¬
tion is found wholly or directly out of moneys voted by Parliament. The number
of civil servants under this definition amounts to more than a million; for it
includes some 400,000 Government industrial employees in such establishments as
Royal Ordnance factories and Admiralty dockyards. The term ‘Civil Service’ is,
however, generally used only to cover ‘non-industrial’ members of the staffs of the
various Government Departments. At the end of September 1954 the total number
of non-industrial civil servants employed in all Departments, at home and overseas,
was 638,176; approximately one-third of this total are women.
Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice, he
serves the Minister (or the Board or Commission) responsible to Parliament for the
Department in which he works, by advising in the formulation of policy and by
carrying out policy decisions once they have been taken.
Development of the Modern Civil Service
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past one hundred years.
Before then, Departments were wholly free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political jobbery
was rife. Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth century (mainly as
the result of a report on the Organisation of the Permanent Civil Service by Sir
Stafford Northcote, Secretary of the Board of Trade, and Sir Charles Edward
Trevelyan, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, which was published in 1854)
included the substitution of open competition for the practice of obtaining Civil
Service appointments by favour or purchase, and the establishment of an indepen¬
dent body, known as the Civil Service Commission, to organize recruitment to the
service. The great expansion in State planning which has taken place during the
last fifty years, and the consequent expansion in the numbers of civil servants and
E
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
56
the scope of their duties, have led to further reorganization. During the last few
decades, recruitment competitions have been adapted to a developing educational
system; co-ordination between the various Departments has been improved; and
the search for increased efficiency in the conduct of public business has been the
task of many Government-appointed commissions and committees of inquiry. As
a result, civil servants are today members of an integrated service with common
conditions of employment and common traditions and standards of conduct which
belong not to individual Departments but to the Civil Service as a whole.
Control of the Service
The general control of the Service is in the hands of the Treasury, as the Depart¬
ment responsible for ensuring that the amount of money voted by Parliament for
the activities of the Civil Service is not exceeded and that the money itself is spent
in the best and most economical way. The Treasury therefore examines and
approves (or disapproves) all new proposals for spending public money; sanctions
(or vetoes) increases of staff; regulates the salaries and conditions of employment of
civil servants; supervises training for the Civil Service; and keeps the machinery of
government continually under review.
The responsibility for the policy and activities of each Department lies with the
Minister, who is answerable to Parliament for what the civil servants in that
Department may do or say.
Structure of the Service
The Minister at the head of each important Government Department (some¬
times known as the Secretary of State) is assisted by one or more junior Ministers.
Directly responsible to the Minister is the permanent Head of the Department—
the Permanent Secretary (sometimes known as the Permanent Under-Secretary
of State)—who is normally supported in the higher direction of the work by one
or more Deputy Secretaries and a varying number of Under-Secretaries and
Assistant Secretaries.
Departmental Organization
The internal organization of Departments varies according to the work allotted
to them by the Government of the day. Most Departments are divided into
branches, divisions and sections, each responsible for some portion of the Depart¬
ment’s activities in decreasing order of size and scope. Two branches are common
to all Departments: a Finance Branch, which is responsible for financial matters
and accounting; and an Establishments Branch, which is responsible for staff
matters. In the larger Departments, the Establishments Branch usually contains
an ‘Organization and Methods’ division, the members of which act in an advisory
capacity as ‘efficiency experts’ for improving the way in which the Department
arranges its work and eliminating all that is not strictly essential to the tasks in
hand. Smaller Departments are advised by the ‘Organization and Methods’
division of the Treasury.
Glasses and Grades
The engagement and position of all civil servants are covered by regulation,
agreement and traditional practice, every civil servant being assured of a definite
status depending upon the post which he is called upon to fill. There are four
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 57
main classes of civil servants,1 each class containing a series of grades. The
classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising Ministers on
policy, for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out
existing policy, and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures
and regulations. This relatively small class, which at end-September 1954
numbered about 3,400, is recruited largely from university graduates.
2. The Executive Class (numbering some 67,300 at end-September 1954),
which is responsible for the day-to-day conduct of Government business,
including the higher work of supply and accounts, within the framework of
established policy. Members of this class must have reached a recognized
educational standard; after entry they may train for specialist work such as
that of an auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Clerical Class (the largest of the main classes, comprising about 187,000
officers), which undertakes all the usual clerical work involved in running
departmental business, e.g., the preparation of accounts and the keeping of
records, the handling of particular claims in accordance with known rules,
and the summarizing and annotation of documents for the assistance of
senior officers.
4. The Typing Class (about 28,000 members), which consists of shorthand
typists, copy typists and learner typists.
Other classes are: the Professional, Scientific and Technical Classes, which consist
of some 112,600 civil servants with the necessary qualifications (e.g., doctors,
lawyers, engineers, information officers and research workers) for carrying out the
wide range of specialized duties which are now discharged by the Government; the
Departmental Classes, which are not found throughout the Service generally but
are confined to one or two Departments, e.g., the Tax Inspectorate of the
Board of Inland Revenue, the Factory Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service, and the Waterguard of the Customs and Excise Department (in
all some 2,700) and the Manipulative Classes, which include large numbers (about
236,600 at end-September 1954) of postal and telegraph officers, postmen, tele¬
phonists, messengers, paper keepers, office cleaners and similar workers in Govern¬
ment Departments, and their immediate supervisors.
Recruitment of Staff
The recruitment of all permanent civil servants is in the hands of the Civil
Service Commission, whose members are appointed by the Crown on the advice of
the Government. The normal method of entry is by open competition, conducted
in accordance with regulations approved by the Treasury and consisting of written
examinations or interviews, or both. The points of entry into the four main classes
of the Civil Service are planned to correspond to definite levels in the British
educational system, and it is the Commission’s duty to study the requirements of
the Civil Service in the light of the education provided by the schools and
universities.
In addition to holding examinations and conducting interviews, the Commission
is responsible for issuing a Certificate of Qualification in respect of each successful
candidate, for placing new entrants in Departments for which their qualifications

and in Her Majesty’s Oversea Civil Service (see p. 40) and for other Government Depart¬
ments such as the Commonwealth Relations Office (see p. 41).
58
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are appropriate, and for watching the careers of those it has selected in order to
ensure that current methods of recruitment are successful and up to date.
Temporary civil servants, who are not entitled to pensions, are normally
recruited by the Department concerned through the Appointments Service (see
p. 231) of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. No qualifying examinations
are required for entrance on a temporary basis to general service.
Training
Each of the larger Government Departments has a Training Officer and a
number of instructors, who organize both general and technical courses where
necessary. Methods vary from Department to Department, but nearly all have
systematic instruction of recruits in all classes. There are also ‘refresher’ courses for
established staff.
Methods of training include the use of films and instructional books; discussion
groups; and educational visits, which enable civil servants to study the appropriate
workings of outside bodies. In addition, officers in the early years of their service
are transferred from branch to branch and sometimes from Department to Depart¬
ment, in order that they may gain as wide an experience as possible of civil service
activities.
The functions of Training Officers are co-ordinated by the Training and Educa¬
tion Division of the Treasury, which also undertakes the task of training the
departmental instructors themselves, and provides central courses, on entry, for
members of the Administrative Class.
Promotion
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
Civil Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by Departments;
those from class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions (open
only to serving members of specified civil service classes), and partly by Depart¬
ments themselves. All promotions to the Administrative Class from other classes
require Treasury approval. Promotions to the highest positions in the Civil Service,
e.g., Permanent Secretaries, Principal Establishments Officers and Principal
Finance Officers, must be approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised in these
matters by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury.
Conditions of Service1
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council2 which is composed jointly of
official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections of the
Service is provided through the various staff associations, which civil servants are
encouraged to join (e.g., the Civil Service Clerical Association, the Union of Post
Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants, the Institution of Professional Civil
Servants, and the Association of First Division Civil Servants) and through depart¬
mental Whitley Councils (of which there are about 80).
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which, except in the very highest
posts, compares reasonably with that paid for similar work outside the Service,
1 A review of the pay of the Civil Service, including the principles which should govern
it, and of other conditions of service such as hours of work and annual leave, is being under¬
taken by a Royal Commission set up in July 1953.

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION i;g
and he is entitled to regular annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of
the grade to which he belongs. In addition, although he holds office at the pleasure
of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, he enjoys, in practice, a
considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent civil servant may
reasonably expect a full career in the public service, and a pension on retirement—
though this, again, is not a legal right.
Civil servants are generally ‘conditioned’ to a given number of hours of atten¬
dance a week. Overtime is paid to members of most of the lower salary groups if
they work longer than their ‘conditioned’ hours. The standard working week in the
Service, at present, is generally 45 J hours. The highest administrative officials, who
work the longest hours, receive no extra remuneration for extra work performed.
Annual leave varies according to the grade up to a maximum, at present, of 36 days
a year. Sick leave on full pay, less any National Insurance benefit received, may be
granted to established civil servants for up to six months in any twelve months, and
on reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants may participate in political activities subject to certain special rules.
Many grades are completely free to engage in national and local political activities;
others are free to engage in most political activities by permission and subject to
certain conditions; while others again are not allowed to take part in national
political activities, but are free to seek permission to engage in local political activi¬
ties. Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all citizens to
register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions, i.e. at a general
election or at local authority elections. Officially, the position and functions of a
civil servant remain the same whichever political party is in power; and it is
his duty to serve the Government of the day irrespective of his own political
opinion.
Every civil servant may engage in such private activities as he wishes, provided
that such activities do not in any way conflict with his official duties, nor with the
provisions of the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920 and the Prevention of
Corruption Act of 1906. A civil servant must not, however, use his official position
to further his private interests; and he is therefore subject to restrictions in matters
of commerce and business from which the ordinary citizen is free, e.g., he may not
hold private interests in public contracts; and he may not use official information
in wrriting, broadcasting or lecturing without the express approval of his Depart¬
ment. Above all, a civil servant is expected to conform to the high standards of
integrity which characterize the Service to which he belongs.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local government has been defined as government by elected local bodies charged
with administrative and executive duties in matters concerning the inhabitants of a
particular district or place and vested with powers to make byelaws for their
guidance.
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of the
United Kingdom for many centuries. It has existed in England continuously since
Saxon times. In its present shape, however, it dates back only to the later nineteenth
century, when the conception of local government by popularly elected councils
received statutory recognition.
The first 40 years of the present century witnessed a sharp increase in, and
expansion of, environmental and social services, and a corresponding increase in
6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the responsibilities of local authorities upon whom the greater part of the manage¬
ment of these services devolved. Legislation passed in the post-war period has
made some further changes; on the one hand the powers of local authorities relating
to the provision of hospitals, gas and electricity supplies, and (in England and
Wales) valuation for rating purposes have been transferred to national boards or
to Government Departments, while on the other, local authorities (mainly the
councils of counties and county boroughs in England and Wales and of counties
and large burghs in Scotland) have been charged with certain additional or new
responsibilities in connection with the health services, care of children, town and
country planning, care of the aged and a number of other welfare services.
Recent changes have not affected the structure of local government, nor its
importance as part of the administrative system as a whole. In the United Kingdom,
it remains as an essential link between the individual and the central Departments
of State.
Relations between Central and Local Government
As the supreme authority in the United Kingdom, Parliament controls local
authorities through Acts of Parliament which require elected local councils to
implement policies prescribed and defined in those Acts. The scope of local
government is limited by the same means; no council may go beyond the boundary
fixed for its activities by an Act of Parliament.
Legislation is supported by departmental supervision; Parliament makes certain
ministers responsible for securing the efficient functioning of local government
services. Departmental supervision is exercised by means of inspections, inquiries,
examinations of statistics, authorization of loans, the issue of advisory circulars and
statutory Rules and Orders, the approval of byelaws, and the administration of
Government grants. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main
link between local authorities and the central Government.
Principal Types of Local Authority
For purposes of local government, England and Wales and Northern Ireland
are divided into county boroughs and administrative counties. Administrative
counties are further divided into three types of county district: municipal or non¬
county boroughs; urban districts; and rural districts, which are themselves sub¬
divided into parishes (except in Northern Ireland). Each of these divisions is
administered by a different kind of local council, as follows:
England and Wales 1
county councils (61)
county borough councils (83)
non-county borough councils (312)
urban district councils (568)
rural district councils (47 6)2
parish councils (about 7,300) or
parish meetings (about 3,800)
Northern Ireland
county councils (6)
county borough councils (2)
non-county borough councils and
municipal town councils (9)
urban district councils (24)
town commissioners (3)
rural district councils (32).
There are, in addition, the local authorities for London, which are unlike those
in the rest of the United Kingdom. They are:
the London County Council
the Corporation of the City of London
the metropolitan borough councils (28).
1 Excluding the London area.
2 Including the Isles of Scilly.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
Scotland
The local authorities in Scotland are:
county councils (33, of which two pairs are combined for certain purposes)
town councils (197, consisting of: the authorities for counties of cities, 4- other
large burghs, 20; and small burghs, 173)
district councils (199; two counties are not divided into districts).
Functions and Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
environmental and social services as it may be required to provide and administer
by an Act of Parliament. It may provide additional services under the permissive
powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by Private Bill legislation.
I he responsibilities of local authorities depend upon the type of council. In
England and Wales and Northern Ireland, for example, county borough councils
are all-purpose authorities, while the county councils and county district councils
i.e. the councils of non-county boroughs and the urban and rural districts each
have particular functions allotted to them, which they exercise independently to a
considerable extent, although there is a certain degree of delegation from county
councils to county district councils especially in the fields of education and planning.
In Scotland, the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities •
elsewhere the county councils exercise very many local government functions. In
arge burghs, they administer education and in some cases police, all other functions
being exercised by the town councils. In small burghs, county councils undertake
a number of important functions, but housing and some other services are
administered by the town councils. The smallest authorities (the parish councils
or parish meetings in England and Wales and the district councils in Scotland)
have a few functions which they may exercise of right.
The services provided by the councils, which are described more fully in later
chapters, may be considered under three heads:
1. Environmental Services, which are services designed to secure and improve the
citizens’ surroundings. The majority are public health and sanitary services
administered in England and Wales either by county, county district or parish
councils (in London by the metropolitan borough councils, in Northern Ireland
by the county district councils and in Scotland by the county and town councils),
e.g., the inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing,
refuse collection and disposal, the supervision of water supplies, measures for
ensuring food hygiene (including inspection of premises where food is prepared,
sold or served, analysis of food samples, etc.), rodent control and the provision of
baths and washhouses. There are also the services for street lighting, public safety
on the highways, and the provision of amenities such as parks and recreation
grounds, which are generally administered by the same authorities. The important
work of town and country planning is done in England and Wales by the county
and county borough councils, except where it is delegated to county district councils,
and in Scotland by county councils and the town councils of large burghs. County
borough councils, as all-purpose authorities, provide and administer their own
environmental services.
2. Protective Services, which include the fire service, the civil defence service
and the police. The fire service is administered throughout England and Wales by
the county borough councils, the county councils or joint boards of these authorities
if neighbouring councils amalgamate; and in Scotland, by the county councils
62
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and the town councils of most of the large burghs or by joint boards. Except for
joint boards, these authorities, together with a few county district councils, and,
in London, the metropolitan borough councils and the City Corporation, are
also responsible for organizing the local divisions of the Civil Defence Corps.1
The police service is administered by Standing Joint Committees in the counties
of England and Wales, by Watch Committees in the county boroughs or by
joint boards. In London, the City Corporation has jurisdiction over the police
force in its area, while the Commissioners of Police, responsible directly to the
Home Secretary and appointed by him, control the Metropolitan Police Force.
The police authorities in Scotland are the county councils, the town councils of
large burghs or joint committees for combined forces.
3. Personal Services, which are services designed to ‘cultivate the best physical,
mental, and moral potentialities of each individual’. The type of authority con¬
cerned depends on the nature of the services, which range from maternity and
child welfare, education, care of children and housing to the provision of entertain¬
ments. Services under this heading also include certain other health services,
services for the aged and infirm, and the provision and upkeep of libraries, museums
and art galleries.
There are also some trading services, e.g., passenger transport, water supply,
and harbour, dock and pier services, although these are now less numerous than
before and during the war.
Local Authority Elections
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government
is always three years. In some cases the whole council retires every third year and
another is elected immediately; in other cases elections are held annually, when one-
third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government elections is governed
by local election rules.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote at a
local government election provided that he or she is a British subject of 21 years
of age or over or a citizen of the Irish Republic, and is registered as a local govern¬
ment elector for the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for
registration as a local government elector if on the qualifying date for the register he
or she is resident in the area or occupies as owner or tenant (in Scotland, owns or
occupies as tenant) any rateable land or premises in the area of a yearly value of
not less than £10.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the council concerned, under
the supervision of a presiding officer specially appointed for the purpose. Every
elector is expected to cast his vote in person, although members of the armed forces
may vote by proxy and (except in rural district or parish council elections) voting
by post, or in certain cases by proxy, may be allowed if it is impossible for the
voter to attend. No elector may give more votes in all than the total number of
councillors to be elected.
Candidates for election stand either as Independents or as representatives of one
of the national or local political parties. Each candidate must be nominated by
two electors, as proposer and seconder; and, in England and Wales, except in elec¬
tions for metropolitan borough councils, rural district councils and parish councils,
eight other electors for the area must assent to the nomination. In Scotland, county
and district council candidates require proposers but no assenters, town council
candidates a proposer and five assenters. Eligibility for nomination as a candidate

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
63
depends in the first place upon registration as a local government elector for the
area, and thereafter upon a number of statutory qualifications and disqualifications
designed to secure that the candidate is a suitable person for the office.
In parliamentary elections, the contest is between several candidates for one seat.
In local government elections there are usually a good many seats to be filled, and
nearly all county and non-county boroughs and metropolitan boroughs in England
and Wales and the larger burghs in Scotland are divided into wards, the number
of councillors elected for each ward being three or a multiple of three. The areas
of all the other authorities, except county councils, may be so divided or they may
be left as single units depending on their size. Counties are split up in accordance
with orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department or the
Secretary of State for Scotland, as the case may be, into electoral divisions which
return members to the county council and to the district council. The London
County Council is organized in three-member divisions, which are the same as the
parliamentary constituencies in its area.
Internal Organization of Local Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own internal
arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they will discharge
their responsibilities. The arrangements made by most councils are briefly as
follows: questions of policy and principle are decided by the whole council, which
appoints committees to carry out the detailed administration of its various services.
The more important of the committees of the larger authorities divide their work
among sub-committees, which stand to the parent committee in more or less the
same relation as do the main committees to the whole council. The execution of
the policy decided upon by the council and the committees rests with salaried
officers and employees, whose number may vary from about half a dozen in a small
rural district to several thousand in the large counties and in the larger county
boroughs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of specialists
on committees and the length of time certain members may hold office, committees
of councils are remarkably free from legal restrictions; even those known as
‘statutory’ committees are constituted according to individual requirements and
not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes of classification, however,
they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary committees and joint committees.
Ordinary committees may be further divided into statutory committees, the
appointment of which is compulsory under an Act of Parliament; standing
committees, which are appointed in accordance with the standing orders of the
council on a permanent basis according to the extent of the council’s business;
and special committees, which a council may set up for a limited period to deal
with a particular problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint Committees or Joint Boards consist of representatives of more than one
authority. They are usually established when local authorities co-operate for
services which cannot be dealt with on purely local lines, e.g., water supply, or
sewerage.
Committees of a local authority may be advisory or executive; their powers and
duties are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders or, in
the case of a county or large burgh in Scotland, in the council’s administrative
scheme. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees except its powers
in connection with raising loans, levying rates or issuing precepts, which are
legally reserved to the council as a whole.
Every council is empowered to appoint such staff as it deems necessary to carry
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
64
out its work. Certain appointments are compulsory, e.g., the Clerk, the Treasurer,
the Medical Officer of Health, the Surveyor and the Sanitary Inspector. Even
the smallest parish councils employ a part-time clerk. Choice of personnel is
normally left to a great extent to the individual council.
Officers are normally of three kinds: heads of departments, whose duties are
mainly of an administrative and managerial kind; subordinate officers employed in
a professional, clerical or technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed
to do the actual physical work for which the council is responsible. As a rule, senior
staff appointments are made at the instance of the committee or committees
particularly concerned; while most junior appointments are made by heads of
departments, who are also responsible for engaging the manudl labour required.
Appointments and engagements are always made in conformity with a set establish¬
ment, and committees are informed of any appointments which they have not
made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council (except where the proposed salary of an
officer requires the approval of a Government Department, as in the case of
the clerk of a county council in England and Wales). They are based on recom¬
mendations made by the Whitley Councils (see p. 238), of which there are
several, including the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative,
Professional, Technical and Clerical Services, the National Joint Industrial Council
for Local Authorities’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers), the National Joint
Council for County Council Roadmen, and, in Scotland, the Joint Industrial
Councils for Local Authority Services. In England and Wales there are also two
special joint committees, which have made recommendations with regard to the
salaries and conditions of service of town clerks, county district council clerks and
other local authority chief officers.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of conduct;
as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must be beyond the
reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
Local Government Finance
Local authorities derive their incomes from Government grants,1 from local
rates, from loans, from trading receipts, rents, fees and other miscellaneous sources.
Government grants are of five main types: assigned revenues, which are the
proceeds of certain national taxes handed over to local authorities, e.g., the proceeds
of dog, game and gun licences and of the licence fees for hawkers, pawnbrokers,
money-lenders and refreshment houses; percentage grants, which are agreed
proportions of local government expenditure upon services approved by Govern¬
ment Departments, e.g., education, health, fire, police and children’s services;
unit grants, which depend exactly on the service provided, e.g., housing subsidies;
equalization grants, which are contributions to the general revenues of the poorer
local authorities; and special grants, which are grants paid from time to time for
some particular purpose.
Rates are a form of local taxation paid by the occupiers (and in Scotland also
by the owners) of land and buildings in a local authority area as contributions to
the cost of local services. They are levied by a poundage on the rateable value of
property which in England and Wales is equivalent to the yearly rent at which
the property might reasonably be expected to let if the tenant paid rates and taxes
and also the cost of insurance and repairs. Valuation is undertaken by the Valuation
1 Paid in Northern Ireland by the Government of Northern Ireland.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
65
Officers of the Board of Inland Revenue; appeals may be made to independent
Valuation Panels. In Scotland the primary basis of valuation is the annual rent
payable. Valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by county councils and
the town councils of large burghs, and appeals lie to a county or burgh Valuation
Committee and thereafter to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of
Session.
The responsibility for levying and collecting the rates in England and Wales lies
with the councils of county boroughs and county districts; in London, with the
City Corporation and the metropolitan borough councils. County councils finance
themselves by issuing a precept on the county districts (in London the metropolitan
borough councils and the City Corporation) for the sums of money required;
while parishes are financed by a special rate for the parish levied by the appropriate
rural district councils. Rates in Scotland are levied by the town councils in burghs
and by county councils elsewhere; to cover their expenditure, district councils
issue a requisition each year to the county council; a town council has to meet an
annual requisition from the county council in respect of the burgh’s share of the
expenditure on functions exercised by the county council throughout the county,
including the burgh. In Northern Ireland, county councils are responsible for
making, levying and collecting the rates, except in such parts of the county as fall
within the jurisdiction of the county borough or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by all types of local authority for items of capital expenditure
which could not well be met out of current revenue, subject to the approval of the
Government Department responsible for the service for which the capital is
required. Such loans may be raised either on the open market or from the Public
Works Loan Board, which was originally constituted under the Public Works
Loans Act, 1875, to make certain local loans out of moneys provided by the
Exchequer and which for a brief period (1945-52) was the only source from which
local authorities could normally borrow. Freedom to borrow on the open market
was restored to local authorities in January 1953.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned by a
Finance Committee, whose function is to keep the financial policy of the council
under constant review. External control is carried out by means of an annual
audit, which in the case of all councils in England and Wales (except for certain
general accounts in about two-thirds of the borough councils) is operated by
district auditors appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.
Borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts which
relate to education, national assistance, children, local health services, coast pro¬
tection, motor tax, rate collection, police, fire, civil defence and town and country
planning, but they may and sometimes do employ a professional firm of auditors
to do other work. In Scotland, all accounts are audited by a professional auditor
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, and paid by the council.
THE LAW
The maintenance of public order in the United Kingdom is effected, generally
speaking, by two agencies—the judiciary and the police. Both are concerned in
different ways with the obedience of the citizen to the law.
Law is said to be based on the concepts of order and compulsion. In the legal
sense, it has been defined as any rule which will be enforced by the courts; as it
applies to a country, it is usually understood as the set of rules by which the
citizens of that country will expect to regulate their conduct in relation to their
fellow citizens and to the State.
66
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There is no written code of law in the United Kingdom. The question whether
a particular rule is recognized as part of law is determined by consideration of the
authorities, which may be statutes, statements made by legal writers, or reports of
decided cases. If none of these exist, the judge uses a process of analogy, that is to
say, he bases his decision in a case on its similarity to a previous case in which
judgment has already been given.
The sources of law in the United Kingdom are statute law and common law,
which is law recognized by the courts as binding on some other grounds than express
enactment. Statute law may include a Royal Proclamation, an Act of Parliament,
and delegated or subordinate legislation, such as orders made by Ministers of the
Crown and byelaws made by local authorities. The origins of common law are to be
found in the customs of the realm.
The greater part of statute law applies uniformly in all four countries of the
United Kingdom, although in many fields of legislation there are statutes applying
to Scotland only. The Scottish common law is also different from that prevailing
in England and Wales and (as a rule) in Northern Ireland, since ancient differences
were perpetuated by the Act for the Union of England and Scotland, 1707, under
which Scotland retained her own system of law.
The two main branches of the law in the United Kingdom, as in most other
countries, are civil law and criminal law. Civil law has been defined as ‘relating to
the maintenance of private claims and the redress of private wrongs, which may
not involve moral guilt’.1 Criminal law deals with offences against the State and
their punishment on behalf of the community.
THE COURTS
The courts that apply the law in the United Kingdom are broadly speaking
divided into civil and criminal courts, although, since the distinction is a compara¬
tively modern one, no hard and fast line can be drawn. Quite a number of civil cases
are, in fact, heard in criminal courts; while occasionally a criminal case may be
heard in what is primarily a civil court.
Civil Courts in England and Wales
The more important of the civil courts in England and Wales are:
The County Courts
The County Courts are so arranged that there is no part of the country more
than a reasonable distance from one of them. This kind of court may be regarded as
a ‘popular tribunal’; something over a million cases are entered in it every year,
although comparatively few ever reach the stage of trial. County Courts are
presided over by a paid judge, sitting alone.
The general jurisdiction of the County Court2 covers all common law actions,
except cases (such as libel) where the personal reputation of the defendant is
involved, provided that the amount claimed does not exceed £200. If the claim is
for more than £100, the defendant may object and apply to have the case referred
to the High Court. Cases which fall under the specific jurisdiction of the County
Courts, e.g., those connected with agricultural holdings, rent restrictions, hire
purchase agreements and other matters governed by statute or ministerial order,
are tried irrespective of the amount involved.

2 In November 1954 the Government announced that legislation would be introduced
to extend the jurisdiction of County Courts.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
67
In addition to the ordinary County Courts, there are still a few local courts, with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval
borough courts, and many of them have little or no work to do at the present time.
Two or three, such as the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court
and the Bristol Tolzey Court, are still comparatively well used.
The Mayor's and City of London Court
This Court, which is the County Court for the City of London, is the amalgama¬
tion of two courts, the Mayor’s Court, with a jurisdiction unlimited as to amount,
and the City of London Court, a court for small cases. It is usually presided over
by a judge appointed by the City of London.
The High Court of Justice
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature. The
Supreme Court of Judicature largely took its present form in 1873. It is composed
of the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
The High Court sits in three divisions: the Queen’s Bench Division, the
Chancery Division, and the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division. These
divisions derive from the old courts of the same names which existed before 1873,
and cases are distributed between them as tradition and convenience dictate.
The Queen’s Bench Division is staffed by the Lord Chief Justice and 25 puisne
judges, i.e. judges without special office of their own. These judges are mainly
concerned with ordinary civil actions—debt cases, actions for damages, revenue
cases, insurance cases, commercial cases, etc.; but they also hear criminal cases
at Assizes (see p. 69).
The Chancery Division is officially headed by the Lord Chancellor; but most of
the work is done by seven puisne judges who remain in London all the time.
The jurisdiction of the Chancery Division derives from the ancient ‘equity’
system, which was introduced into the English legal system to modify the older
common law system during the Middle Ages. Its purpose was to temper justice with
mercy, when conscience was opposed to the rigours of the law. It was used primarily
to enforce transactions which give a moral right, but a right then unknown to
common law; and to provide more effectual remedies for existing legal rights. It
was an addendum to the common law, with which it was fused in 1873. The work
of the Chancery Division covers actions for the administration of the estates of
deceased persons; partnership actions; actions connected with trusts and mortgages;
some tax cases; the care of infants’ estates; and company and bankruptcy matters.
The Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division deals, as its name implies, with
the proof of wills, with Admiralty and shipping cases, and with divorce cases, many
of which are also heard (at present) before Queen’s Bench and county court judges.
Appellate Courts
There are two Appellate Courts in civil law actions—the Court of Appeal, which
is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature (see above), and the House of Lords.
There are several ex-officio members of the Court of Appeal, but its effective
head is a judge called the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eight Lord
Justices of Appeal. Appeals lie to the Court of Appeal from the County Courts, the
Mayor’s and City of London Court and the civil side of the High Court. The
Court of Appeal generally sits in two or three divisions, with three judges to a
division.
From the Court of Appeal, a further appeal is possible to the House of Lords,
with the leave of the House of Lords or of the Court of Appeal. Such appeals are
68
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
usually heard by seven Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, who are paid professional
judges with peerages for life. In addition, the Lord Chancellor and any peers who
have held ‘high judicial office’ are entitled to sit. The House of Lords is the
supreme court of appeal in civil cases in the whole of the United Kingdom.
Civil Courts in Scotland
The Sheriff Court
The Sheriff Court in its civil capacity corresponds roughly to the County Court
in England and Wales, but it has a wider jurisdiction unlimited by the value of the
case. It also has power to try (summarily or by indictment1) all but the most serious
crimes and offences. The initial work of the court is normally done by a Sheriff-
Substitute, against whose judgment an appeal may be made to the Sheriff2 or
directly to the Court of Session.
Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by Justices
of the Peace.
The Court of Session
The Court of Session is the supreme civil court in Scotland. It was established in
1532 and consists at present of 14 judges. The Court is divided into two parts—the
Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court, and the Outer House, a court of
first instance, where, inter alia, all actions for divorce are taken. The Inner House
is divided into two Divisions of equal status, each consisting of four judges; the
First Division being presided over by the Lord President, and the Second Division
by the Lord Justice Clerk. From the Inner House, an appeal lies to the House of
Lords.
The Scottish Land Court
This is a special court in Scotland for dealing with certain agricultural matters.
The Court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank and dignity of
a Judge of the Court of Session.
Criminal Courts in England and Wales
The criminal courts in England and Wales include:
Petty Sessional or Magistrates' Courts
Magistrates’ courts are courts of summary jurisdiction, i.e. courts where accused
persons may be tried without a jury.3 All kinds of minor offences are tried in this
way, although if any offence coming into a magistrates’ court is punishable by
more than three months’ imprisonment, the accused may elect to be tried in a
higher court with a jury.
The less serious indictable offences may also be tried summarily in a magistrates’
1 An indictment is a formal written accusation. An indictable offence is an offence which
requires such an accusation for its prosecution.
2 Scotland is divided into 12 Sheriffdoms, each provided with a Sheriff and a varying
number of Sheriffs-Substitute.
8 A jury is a body of private citizens selected and sworn to declare the truth as to any
particular matter on the evidence placed before them. Generally speaking, a jury consists
of twelve persons, men and women, with certain property qualifications, i.e. having £10
a year in real estate or rents arising therefrom, or who, as householders, are assessed for
rates at not less than £30 a year in the metropolitan area or not less than £20 a year
elsewhere. The decision of a jury must be unanimous, otherwise a re-trial is ordered.
6g
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
court, should the accused desire it, and in fact a large number of such cases are
tried in this way. In 1953 over 95 per cent of all criminal cases in England and
Wales were disposed of in magistrates’ courts.
The majority of these courts are presided over by two or more unpaid ‘lay’
magistrates or justices of the peace, who are appointed by the Crown, in each
county, and for each borough which has its own commission of the peace, on the
recommendation of the Lord Chancellor, who is advised as to a county by the Lord
Lieutenant1 with the assistance of an advisory committee, and as to boroughs by
separate advisory committees. There are also a few persons who are authorized by
statute to act as justices, by virtue of holding some other public office, e.g., mayors
of county and non-county boroughs and chairmen of county councils.
In central London, the courts are presided over by paid metropolitan magistrates;
some of the larger towns also have stipendiary magistrates.
Juvenile courts for the trial of young offenders are constituted from special panels
of suitably qualified justices appointed by the justices of each county or borough out
of their own number. A juvenile court consists of not more than three justices
drawn from the panel, and must hold its sitting at a different time from those of the
ordinary summary court or in a different room.
Domestic proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, of whom
one should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic proceedings is
separated from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the public is excluded.
In addition to acting as judges, magistrates are required to conduct preliminary
inquiries into indictable offences to determine whether or not an accused person
should be committed for trial.
Courts of Quarter Session
There are two different kinds of Quarter Sessions—county sessions and borough
sessions; both are normally held four times a year.
County Quarter Sessions consist of the magistrates of the county assembled
together under a legally qualified chairman. In those boroughs, which hold separate
Quarter Sessions, the courts are presided over by a Recorder, who is a salaried
barrister, as sole judge. Trial by jury applies at both borough and county sessions.
The jurisdiction of Quarter Sessions covers the less serious indictable offences;
the courts are debarred, for example, from trying any crime that carries the death
sentence or detention for life.
Assizes
The Courts of Assize are branches of the High Court of Justice. They are held
in the county towns and in certain big cities three times a year, a Queen’s Bench
judge or a Commissioner of Assize (who may be a barrister commissioned to act as
a judge) presiding. The Assize judges work on circuits covering England and Wales,
and travel from one county town to another in the course of their duties. They can
try any indictable offence committed in the county.
At the winter and summer Assizes, civil business as well as criminal may be
taken, but except in a few large towns the autumn Assize is confined to criminal
cases.
The Central Criminal Court
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey acts as the Court of Assize for the
criminal business of London, Middlesex and parts of the Home Counties. The
1 The office of Lord Lieutenant in the county was first created in the sixteenth century.
Its holder was chief among the county justices and commander of the county militia.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
70
judges include: a judge chosen from the Queen’s Bench Division in rotation for
each monthly session of the Court; the Recorder of London; the Common Serjeant;
and two additional judges of the Mayor’s and City of London Court.
Criminal Appeals
Appeals may be made direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court on a
point of law; but the more usual kind of appeal is the appeal of a convicted person
against his conviction or his sentence. Appeals of this kind from a magistrates’ court
are heard in the counties by the Appeals Committee of Quarter Sessions, consisting
of between three and twelve magistrates, and in the boroughs by the Recorder; in
neither case is a jury required.
Appeals against convictions by Quarter Sessions or Assizes go to the Court of
Criminal Appeal. Appeals may be made on any point of law, and also, by leave, on
point of fact.
The Court of Criminal Appeal consists of the Lord Chief Justice and any
Queen’s Bench judges; three in session is the usual number.
A further appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the House of Lords on a
point of law can be made if the Attorney-General grants a certificate affirming that
the appeal is of ‘exceptional public importance’. Appeals of this kind are very rare.
Criminal Courts in Scotland
The bulk of the criminal actions in Scotland are heard in the Sheriff Court (see
p. 68). In cases of breach of the peace and other petty offences the justices in
Justice of the Peace Courts in the counties and the magistrates in magistrates’ courts
in burghs have powers of jurisdiction. Cases involving serious crime are taken in
the High Court of Justiciary, which is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
It also functions as an appeal court from inferior criminal courts. It consists of the
Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session), the
Lord Justice Clerk and thirteen Lords Commissioners of Justiciary who are also
judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edinburgh, but the
judges go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns. Appeals to the High Court are
heard by three or more judges; there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
Courts in Northern Ireland
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller community.
The main difference is that there is no lay magistracy in the country, all petty
sessional cases being dealt with by resident magistrates who correspond to the
metropolitan or stipendiary magistrates of England and Wales. The inferior courts,
that is to say the courts where the less serious cases are tried, are administered by
the Parliament of Northern Ireland; the administration of the superior courts has
been reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
The Coroner’s Court
The Coroner’s Court, strictly speaking, is neither a civil nor a criminal court,
although it has some connection with criminal proceedings. It is the duty of a
coroner to inquire into any death reported to him if there is reasonable cause to
suspect that the deceased has died a violent or unnatural death, or has died a
sudden death of which the cause is unknown. Various Acts of Parliament lay down
the cases in which a coroner must be informed and those in which a jury must be
summoned if an inquest is held. If the jury at a coroner’s court returns a verdict
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
71
of murder, manslaughter or infanticide against some particular person, then that
person must be committed for trial at Assizes. In Scotland, the office of Coroner
does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal inquires privately into all sudden and suspi¬
cious deaths in his district and may report the results of his inquiries to the Crown
Agent who considers, with the Crown Counsel, what proceedings, if any are
required.
Ecclesiastical Courts
The established Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts, which
constitute a graduated hierarchy. They include the Court of the Archdeacon, the
Consistory Court of the Bishop of each diocese and the Provincial Courts of the
Archbishops of Canterbury and of York.
The ecclesiastical courts, which are still courts in the full sense of the word, have
jurisdiction only in matters of purely ecclesiastical concern, such as questions of
doctrine and ritual, ordination, consecration, and the celebration of divine service.
Special Tribunals
A number of special tribunals exist in the United Kingdom for the exercise of
what is known as administrative justice, that is to say for the settlement of disputes
or the determination of rights in cases where the public interest is the central
issue.
Such tribunals are too various to permit of any formal classification, but they
include professional tribunals such as the General Medical Council, the General
Council of the Bar, and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society, which
regulates the professional practice, conduct and discipline of solicitors. They also
include ministerial tribunals, such as the War Pensions Tribunals, the Lands
Tribunal, the Rent Tribunals, and the Local Appeal Tribunals for Insurance
Benefits; and the disciplinary committees of marketing boards.
Appeals on a point of law in most cases lie from such tribunals either to a single
judge of the High Court or to permanent Commissioners appointed under an Act
of Parliament or to the appropriate minister.
Military Courts
The jurisdiction of military courts or courts martial is exclusively over persons
subject to military law. The powers of the courts are limited to those conferred on
them by statute, and if these powers are exceeded, the person injured has his
remedy in the High Court.
THE JUDICIARY
The judiciary of the United Kingdom is independent. That is to say, it is free to
administer the law under the protection of the law without fear or favour. All
judges, from those of the House of Lords and the Supreme Courts to the ‘lay’
magistrates or justices of the peace, must not only be, but must appear to be,
completely impartial, for it is of fundamental importance that ‘justice should not
only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done’.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts in that ‘all jurisdiction
of the courts is either indirectly or immediately derived from the Crown’1; but
since the end of the seventeenth century, it has been unlawful for the Sovereign to
disturb or delay the course of common justice, to attempt to force the judges to act
1 Blackstone’s Commentaries.
F
72
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
otherwise than impartially, or to use the prerogative powers of the Crown to create
courts to administer any system of law other than common law.
The independence of the judiciary vis-a-vis the legislature is likewise strictly
observed. Thus, although the Act of Settlement, 1701, laid down that the judges
of the superior courts should be appointed by the Crown to hold office during
good behaviour subject to a power of removal by the Sovereign on an address
by both Houses of Parliament, it may be stated with confidence that no such
address would ever be moved to interfere with judicial independence. By the
same token, although no court in the United Kingdom would ever question the
validity of an Act of Parliament which had been duly passed by both Houses of
Parliament and duly promulgated and published by the proper authority, it might,
through its interpretation of the statute, come to a decision contrary to the policy
of the Government which introduced the Act. In such a case, it would be open
to the Government to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the statute, or
even to pass a new Act to reverse the decision of the court. It would not be open
to it to penalize the judge or to try to influence the court in any other way.
Administration of the Judicial System
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. The central responsibility
for the administration of the judicial system in England and Wales lies partly with
the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary.
Crown appointments to the High Court bench are made on the recommendation
of the Lord Chancellor, who is also responsible for recommending to the Crown
the appointment or removal of justices of the peace,1 Recorders of boroughs and
metropolitan and stipendiary magistrates. County Court judges are appointed
by the Lord Chancellor (except in Lancashire, where they are nominated by
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster).2 The administrative business of the
Supreme Court of Judicature and the appointment of court officials is partly in the
hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the hands of the appropriate judges.
The Lord Chancellor is a member of the Rule Committee which makes the rules
of the Supreme Court,3 he also appoints the County Court Rule Committee and
has power to alter or to disallow the rules made by it. In addition, responsibility for
initiating proposals for law reform, save in the field of criminal law, lies with the
Lord Chancellor, who is advised in this matter by the Law Reform Committee and
the Private International Law Committee, both established in 1952.
The Home Secretary is responsible for approving appointments of clerks to
justices throughout England and Wales, and for the general administration of
magistrates’ courts, except in relation to their judicial functions in which they can
1 See footnote 1 p. 48.
2 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399. has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign, although kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
separately administered. Full power to manage and control the Duchy is delegated by
the Sovereign to the Chancellor, who is the chief officer of the Duchy Council. The
Chancellorship is now a political appointment carrying with it Cabinet rank. Since the
Duchy duties of the Chancellor are not onerous, he is free to perform any special functions
which may be entrusted to him by the Prime Minister.
3 In its Second Interim Report (March 1951. Cmd. 8176), the Committee on Supreme
Court Practice and Procedure set up in 1947 (primarily to make recommendations for
the purpose of reducing the cost of litigation and securing greater efficiency and expedition
in the dispatch of business) proposed the establishment of a Rules and Administration
Committee, whose duty would be to keep under constant review the Rules of the Supreme
Court and the working of the Law Courts in their bearing upon procedure. The final Report
of the Committee on Supreme Court Practice and Procedure, Cmd. 8878, was published
in July_i953.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 73
be controlled only by the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court. The local
responsibility for the administration of magistrates’ courts lies with the magistrates’
courts committees, of which there is one for each county and county borough.
In Scotland, the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appointment of
the Lord President and the Lord Justice General (see p. 68). Power of submission
tor appointment of all other judges lies with the Secretary of State for Scotland on
1 reon0minat^°n t^le k°rc* Advocate. The High Court of Justiciary and the Court
of Session are administered by the Clerk of the Justiciary and his staff and the
Principal Clerk of Session and his staff respectively. Powers of appointment and
removal of justices of the peace, formerly held by the Lord Chancellor, will be
transferred in 1955 to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
THE LEGAL PROFESSION
The legal profession of England and Wales is strictly divided into two classes of
lawyers—barristers and solicitors. The distinction is due mainly to historical
causes, and is practically unknown in other countries, except in Scotland where the
cleavage between advocates and solicitors is also complete.
No hard and fast line can be drawn between the work of the solicitor and the
work of the barrister, since there are many barristers who do little advocacy, and
there are solicitors who do little else, and who have made considerable reputations
for themselves in the courts in which they are permitted to appear. In general,
however, it may be said that solicitors are professional men who undertake legal
business for lay clients; while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors and conduct legal proceedings in the higher courts.
A barrister is required to have reached an accepted educational standard, to have
passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of Legal Education and to
have become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s
Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple. After ten years as a junior counsel
a barrister may apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appointing him Queen’s
Counsel a proceeding that is known as ‘taking silk’. The highest appointments in
the legal profession, including those of Attorney-General, Solicitor-General, and
other Law Officers of the Crown, are usually open only to barristers who have
become Queen’s Counsel. The professional conduct of a barrister throughout his
career is subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar.
The prospective solicitor must be considered suitable by the appropriate Com¬
mittee of the Law Society and he must enter into ‘Articles of Clerkship’ with a
practising solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his
professional career. The term of articles lasts for three or five years, depending
upon the educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations held by the Law Society and, unless he has been a barrister
or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend a course of
studies at a recognized law school. Once a solicitor is qualified, he becomes an
officer of the Supreme Court of Judicature. He may also become a member of the
Law Society.
In Scotland, the conditions for admission as, and the standing of, advocates and
solicitors are much the same as those applying in the case of barristers and solicitors
in England and Wales.
LEGAL AID
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources have
existed in some courts and to a limited extent for centuries in England and Wales
74
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and in Scotland. The schemes were revised in 1949 when the Legal Aid and Advice
Act and the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act received Royal Assent. These
Acts were introduced to improve and extend the existing arrangements in civil
proceedings so that no one would be financially unable to prosecute a just and
reasonable claim or to defend a legal right, and to make the facilities already available
in criminal proceedings more easily accessible to those who need them. The Acts
also provided that solicitors and barristers acting for persons receiving legal aid
should no longer be required to act gratuitously in civil cases, but should be
remunerated for their services from public funds.
When the system set up under the terms of the Acts comes fully into operation,
aid will be available for both civil and criminal cases in all courts, to plaintiff and
defendant alike.
Legal Aid in Civil Cases
Legal aid in civil cases is now available to persons whose income, computed in
accordance with rules applied by the National Assistance Board, does not exceed
£420 a year, and whose capital, as so computed, does not exceed £500. Where an
assisted person can afford to make a contribution to the costs of his case, he is liable
to pay an amount which is settled with due regard to his financial resources.
In England and Wales, legal aid in civil cases is at present limited to proceedings
started in the High Court or in the Court of Appeal, although eventually the scheme
will cover representation in courts of all types, from magistrates’ courts up to the
House of Lords. The scheme is operated through the Law Society under the
general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. The cost is met from a Legal Aid Fund,
drawn from three sources: contributions and fees from assisted persons; costs
recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from the Exchequer.
For the purposes of the scheme, England and Wales are divided into twelve
areas. In each area a committee, known as an area committee and consisting of
fifteen solicitors and barristers, is responsible for the scheme’s initial organization
and subsequent administration. Local committees are responsible for setting up
legal aid centres to which anyone seeking legal aid may apply. Committees hear
the facts, and if they consider that there is a prima facie case they give it their
support. The person who wishes to bring the action is then allowed to select from
a panel a solicitor and, if necessary, a barrister, who conducts the case in the
normal way. To avoid overloading the courts, certain types of action, including
breach of promise, and libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland the Legal Aid Scheme is administered by the Law Society of
Scotland through a Central Supervisory Committee, a Supreme Court Committee
and twenty-one local committees. Legal aid is at present available for civil proceed¬
ings in the Court of Session and the Sheriff Courts. An applicant for legal aid in
Scotland is required to show a ‘probable cause’ and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of Scottish
law.
Legal Aid in Criminal Courts
Free legal aid is already available in the criminal courts in England and Wales
under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, the Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act, i93°» and
the Summary of Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933. The Legal Aid and Advice Act,
1949, makes certain procedural changes in the system and provides for the transfer
of the financial responsibility for paying for free legal aid from local to central
funds.
Pending the full implementation of the Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland) Act,
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 75
legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons in Scotland under the Poor’s
Roll system, which is administered on a voluntary basis by the legal profession.
In Northern Ireland, free legal aid in criminal cases is afforded to poor persons
under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Act, 1945. The cost of providing
free legal aid is met out of public funds.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
It is a basic principle of the English legal system that the prosecution must prove
the guilt of an accused person, no matter what the charge or where the trial, and
that such a person must be presumed innocent until his guilt has been proved.
When a person has been proved guilty, but not until then, he becomes subject
to the penal system, the underlying objectives of which are deterrence and
reformation. It is held that the deterrent effect of the system lies less in the punitive
treatment of the detected offender than in its total action—fear of detection, public
trial and conviction and the possibility of punishment, whether by imprisonment
or otherwise—and that the aim in imprisonment as well as in other forms of treat¬
ment should be to concentrate as far as possible on the social rehabilitation of the
offender rather than on merely punitive measures.
The various types of penalties which may be imposed according to the law
depend on the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The death sentence
is passed only on persons found guilty of murder or treason; and it is the long-
established practice for the Home Secretary to review every capital case before the
law is allowed to take its course and to consider whether there are grounds for
advising the Crown to exercise the Prerogative of Mercy. Where a reprieve is
recommended, the sentence of death is commuted to one of imprisonment for life.
The death sentence may not in any case be passed upon a person under the age
of eighteen, upon a pregnant woman, or upon anyone who is found to be legally
insane.
Administrative Authorities
In England and Wales, general responsibility for all institutions for the treatment
of offenders is vested in the Home Secretary. His statutory powers and duties in
this connection include the making of rules for the governance of such institutions,
the nomination of the Prison Commissioners, and the appointment of Boards of
Visitors.
In the discharge of his duties relating to institutions for offenders, the Home
Secretary is advised by an Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders, which
also acts as the National Working Group for the Economic and Social Council of
the United Nations, and as the National Committee of the International Penal and
Penitentiary Commission.
Responsibility to the Home Secretary for the administration and inspection of
prisons, Borstal Institutions and detention centres in England and Wales lies with
the Prison Commission and an appropriate professional and technical staff. The
Prison Commission consists of not more than five Commissioners, who are
appointed by the Crown, including the chairman, who is appointed to that office
by the Home Secretary. There are also a number of Assistant Commissioners who
are inspectors under the Prison Acts.
The oversight of each of these institutions is the responsibility of either Visiting
Committees appointed by the justices for those prisons to which convicted persons
are committed direct from their courts, or Boards of Visitors appointed by
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
76
the Home Secretary for the other prisons and institutions. The main functions of
the committees and boards are: to act as the superior disciplinary authority of the
prison or institution; to constitute an independent judicial body to which any
prisoner or inmate may take a complaint or request; and to report direct to the
Home Secretary, both by formal annual report and as occasion may require, on
every aspect of the administration of the prison. In Borstal Institutions and pre¬
ventive detention prisons, the boards also advise the Prison Commissioners on
the release of the inmates on licence.
The prison systems of Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of
the Secretary of State for Scotland and of the Minister for Home Affairs respec¬
tively, and are administered by the Home Departments in Edinburgh and in
Belfast.
Prisons
There are various types of prison in England and Wales, e.g., general local prisons;
special local prisons which, for example, may be open prisons or prisons for selected
prisoners; corrective training prisons to which offenders of 21 years of age or over
may be sentenced if their criminal antecedents show that they are no longer novices
in crime and are in the way of becoming professional criminals; and training prisons
to which prisoners may be sent if they have sentences long enough to enable a
definite course of training to be undertaken, and if they seem likely to co-operate in
and profit by the training. In Northern Ireland, with its smaller population, the
necessity for several kinds of prison for the separation of various classes of prisoners
does not arise to the same extent as in England and Wales. The Scottish system of
classification of prisoners is broadly the same as that of England and Wales; but
each prison in Scotland accommodates more than one classification group.
Full-time prison officers of all ranks, except chaplains, are permanent civil
servants. At the end of December 1953 prison staff of all grades in England
and Wales numbered just over 4,000. About 10 per cent of this number were
women.
Glassification of Prisoners
Every person committed to prison is first received in the local prison serving the
court from which he is committed. Subsequently, he may either serve his whole
sentence at the local prison or he may be sent to another institution, depending on
his age, the length and nature of his sentence, and his personal history and character.
The object of classification is first to ensure the separation of the sexes, of young
persons from adults, of untried prisoners from convicted prisoners and of civil
prisoners from criminal prisoners; secondly to prevent contamination, among con¬
victed prisoners, of the better by the worse; and thirdly to provide training appro¬
priate to their needs for those among convicted prisoners who seem likely to benefit
therefrom.
Training
The main elements of prison training have been defined as (1) the provision of
work which will, so far as is practicable, help to fit prisoners to earn their living
after release, with technical training in skilled trades for suitable persons, (2) the
provision of suitable educational facilities, and (3) the provision of every oppor¬
tunity for the development of a sense of personal responsibility, including (for
suitable persons) training in open conditions.
Full training can be given only in prisons set aside for the purpose, which provide
vocational training courses, based on a Ministry of Labour and National Service
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 77
syllabus, at which prisoners may receive a theoretical and practical training in a
number of skilled trades. The principles on which training is based, however, hold
good for all prisons and are applied as far as individual conditions permit.
Employment
Prison industries are organized under the control of a Director of Industries, who
has a head office staff of technical officers and supervisors, including a supervisor of
farms and gardens, and industrial managers at the prisons.
Except in training prisons, where the hours are longer, prisoners spend at
present about 27 hours a week in the workshops or in other employment such as
building, farm work, domestic work and gardening.
All prisoners are entitled to earn a limited amount from the first day of their
sentence; these amounts may be increased for satisfactory output after a specified
lapse of time.
Education
Educational schemes are provided in prisons in England, Wales and Scotland by
the local education authorities with the advice of the Government Departments
responsible for education in their respective countries and, in England and Wales,
under the organizational control of the Director of Education in the Prison
Commission. Evening Institutes have also been established; and a wide range of
correspondence courses is made available for those who have a serious desire to
improve their education and qualifications.
Educational schemes are supplemented by periodical lectures, film displays,
concerts, and dramatic performances. Prisoners may use the prison library, which
in most cases is now under the management of the county, city or borough library
committee; in certain cases they may also have books sent in to them by friends.
Welfare
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland)
and a Roman Catholic priest are appointed to every prison. Ministers of the
Methodist Church and of other denominations are either appointed or specially
called in as required. The chaplain is generally responsible for welfare in the
prison to which he is appointed. Regular services are held, and chaplains and other
ministers may visit prisoners in their cells. Prisoners may also be visited by their
relatives and friends at specified intervals and by recognized prison visitors asked
to serve in this field by the Prison Commissioners. The voluntary work of these
visitors is co-ordinated and guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Remission of Sentence
On reception, all prisoners are credited with remission of one-third of their
sentence (one-fourth in Northern Ireland), provided that this does not reduce
their sentence below one month. In addition, at successive stages of a prisoner’s
sentence, he becomes entitled to additional privileges; for example, he is allowed
to have some of his personal belongings in his cell.
For breaches of discipline in prison, the Governor or the Visiting Committee or
the Board of Visitors have power to order forfeiture of remission and of privileges.
After-Care of Prisoners
Prisoners from local prisons are assisted on discharge by Discharged Prisoners’
Aid Societies, which are local and voluntary bodies supported partly by private and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
78
partly by public funds. The work of the local societies is co-ordinated by the
National Association of Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies, which depends on a
grant from public funds for its administrative expenses. For persons discharged
from other prisons and from Borstal Institutions, after-care is in the hands of the
Central After-Care Association, which is under the management of a voluntary
council appointed by the Home Secretary.
In England and Wales the Association works through local associates, usually
Probation Officers, who, since the passing of the Criminal Justice Act, have added
after-care to their other duties, and in Scotland through voluntary guardians. These
officers make all arrangements for the reception of the prisoner after his discharge,
and will advise, assist and befriend him for as long as is necessary or required by
statute.
Institutions for Young Offenders
The Criminal Justice Act of 1948 provided that no court can impose imprison¬
ment on a person under twenty-one years of age unless it considers that no other
method of dealing with him is appropriate. The different types of institution
which are available when institutional treatment is considered necessary are
described below.
Remand Homes
Remand Homes are provided by local authorities for the safe custody of boys
and girls under the age of seventeen before or during their appearance at court, for
short periods of punitive detention or while the courts make inquiries about the
best method of treating a young offender. There are facilities for observation,
and valuable reports can be provided as a result of the short stay in a remand
home.
Borstal Institutions
Borstals have been established to provide suitable training for adolescents in
conditions other than those of a prison. There are 17 institutions for boys and
three for girls in England and Wales, four for boys in Scotland,1 and one for boys
and one for girls in Northern Ireland. The period of the sentence is in effect four
years (three years in Northern Ireland), the first part being nine months to three
years’ training (two in Northern Ireland) in a Borstal Institution, and the second a
period of controlled freedom under supervision. The system of training seeks the
all-round development of character and capacities, and is based on progressive trust
demanding increasing personal decision, responsibility and self-control. There is
much freedom of movement and many Borstals are conducted in open conditions.
An initial period of classification ensures that each boy or girl is sent to the institution
best suited to his or her character and requirements.
Approved Schools
There are 124 Approved Schools in England and Wales, 25 in Scotland and six
in Northern Ireland, which provide residential education and training for young
offenders and children in need of care or protection. The choice of school depends
on the child’s age, sex and religious denomination; the education, in general,
following the lines of that given in ordinary schools, with vocational training for
1 Girls receive Borstal training in other institutions in Scotland.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 79
older boys and girls. The emphasis is on character training and on the provision of
after-care.
In England and Wales two new forms of treatment, at Attendance Centres and
Detention Centres, have been introduced on an experimental basis.
Attendance Centres
The main objects of these centres are to teach young offenders a respect for the
law and to give them some instruction in the proper use of leisure. Young offenders
must attend during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; activities
include physical training and instruction in handicrafts. The scheme is in operation
in some 30 towns and for boys over 12 and under 17 years of age.
Detention Centres
At these centres offenders over 14 and under 21 years of age may be detained
for short periods, usually of three months, under discipline suitable to their age
and character. 1 he regime is designed as a ‘short sharp shock’ for those who need
to be taught that the law cannot be defied with impunity. Two centres, one for boys
of 14 to 17 years of age, and one for youths of 17 to 20 years of age, are now in
operation.
Probation
The probation system is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender
while he remains at work or at school in the community under the supervision of a
probation officer, whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal
feature of the system is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before
making a probation order, the court must explain its effects to the offender and
inform him that if he fails to comply with its requirements he will be liable to be
dealt with for the original offence. A probation order cannot be made unless the
offender expresses his willingness to comply with all its requirements.1 The order
usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with the probation officer,
to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It may also require him to
live in a specified place, or to submit to treatment for his mental condition. A
probation order is made for not less than one year and not more than three
years.
There are approximately 1,200 whole-time probation officers in England and
Wales, 15 in Northern Ireland and 100 whole-time and 35 part-time in Scotland.
Training facilities in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on the
advice of the Probation Advisory and Training Board. In Scotland training is pro¬
vided during the first year of appointment and before the officer is allowed to make
probation work his permanent career.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organized and controlled on a local basis
under the guidance of those Ministers of the Crown who are responsible for the
maintenance of law and order in their respective countries. In England and Wales
the responsible Minister is the Home Secretary; in Scotland, the Secretary of State
1 In England and Wales, this does not apply if the offender is under 14 years of age.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the police force (see p. 83) is controlled by an
Inspector-General who is responsible to Northern Ireland’s Minister of Home
Affairs.
POLICE IN GREAT BRITAIN
Police Forces
There are 126 separate, independent police forces in England and Wales, defined
according to area of responsibility as county forces, borough forces, combined
forces (which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over neighbouring
counties or boroughs), the Metropolitan Police Force (which is responsible for the
county of London, the county of Middlesex, parts of adjoining counties and three
county boroughs) and the City of London force. In Scotland there are 33 forces,
including county forces, burgh forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland, police forces vary considerably in size
according to the area and population which they serve. Thus the Metropolitan
Police Force has an establishment of nearly 20,000, while the smallest force in
Scotland numbers 16.
The present strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approximately
72,000 men and 2,000 women.
Police Authorities
Police authorities are appointed for each police force in England and Wales and
Scotland. In the counties of England and Wales the police authority is the Standing
Joint Committee, half of whose members are members of the county council while
the other half are justices of the peace. In the boroughs the police authority is known
as the Watch Committee and is elected by the council from its members. The police
authority of a combined force is made up of representatives of the constituent areas
as prescribed in the scheme under which they combine.
In the Metropolitan police district the Home Secretary is the police authority.
In the City of London the Common Council is the police authority, although
it usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all police matters on its
behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county or joint county
council; in the large burghs it is the town council; where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
It is the statutory duty of the police authorities to establish and maintain efficient
police forces for their areas. They are also responsible for the appointment of the
chief officer of police in their areas, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary
in the provinces of England and Wales, to the approval of the Crown in the City of
London, and to the approval of the Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland. In
the Metropolitan police district the chief officer of police and his immediate sub¬
ordinates are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Home
Secretary.
Central Authority
Co-ordination and a certain measure of central control are exercised through
detailed police regulations which are issued for their respective countries by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are required by the
Police Act, 1919, ‘to act in consultation one with another’ in this connection. The
police regulations cover the ‘government, mutual aid, pay, allowances, pensions,
clothing, expenses and conditions of service’ of the members of all police forces to
which the Act applies.
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 8l
The Secretaries of State are advised on questions relating to the conditions of
service of the police by the Police Council of Great Britain, a negotiating body
established on Whitley Council lines in September 1953. In their supervisory
responsibilities they are assisted by Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary, who
inspect each force, except the Metropolitan Police Force, at least once a year. There
are at present four inspectors in England and Wales and one in Scotland.
Central control also derives from the fact that all police authorities receive a
Government grant equal to half their net expenditure reckoned in accordance with
the provisions of Orders made under the Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Act,
1950 (as regards England and Wales), and the Police (Scotland) Act, 1946 (as
regards Scotland). These Orders empower the Home Secretary and Secretary of
State for Scotland to withhold the grant in whole or in part, permanently or for
such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police area is effi¬
ciently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered, or that the
rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
Centrally Run Services
During recent years the Home Office has established a number of common
services to supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use.
In England and Wales such services include a training service, which provides a
number of residential district training centres and a central police college; the
supply on a rental basis of all wireless equipment for the police; and a forensic
science service, which provides laboratories for the use of regional groups of forces.
In Scotland there is a central police college, which provides training courses for
recruits and courses of higher training; but the provision and maintenance of wire¬
less equipment is a direct charge upon the police authorities concerned and there is
no centrally run forensic service. The Glasgow police force, however, operates an
extensive laboratory, the service of which is available to the whole of the Scottish
police, and the universities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St. Andrews
render assistance when required.
In addition to the common services, a number of national services are provided
by the Metropolitan Police Force, whose functions in this respect include: (a) the
maintenance of the Criminal Record Office, which is a national registry of crimes
and their perpetrators containing a Central Fingerprint Bureau, available to all
police forces of the United Kingdom and certain foreign forces; (b) the publication
of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people wanted for crime, stolen
property, etc., and is supplied without charge to the police forces of the United
Kingdom and to certain Commonwealth and foreign forces; (c) the organization
and control of the Special Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department at
New Scotland Yard,2 whose duties include the protection of Royalty, Ministers of
the Crown, and distinguished foreign visitors; and (d) the carrying out of extradi¬
tion orders made by the courts. For these services, the Metropolitan Police Force
receives an additional Exchequer grant.
Police Officers
There are several different kinds of police officer in Great Britain: regular police
officers who usually serve for 25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension;
1 A Scottish Police Gazette is published by the City of Glasgow Police Force.
2 The Metropolitan Police Force is not the only force with a Criminal Investigation
Department; all provincial forces have their own Criminal Investigation Departments.

members of the first police reserve, which is composed almost entirely of police
pensioners or men with previous police experience who are prepared to give who*e-
time paid service to a particular force in an emergency, whether national or local;
members of the Special Constabulary, which consists of volunteers who perform
short periods of duty without pay in their spare time from their normal occupations;
the police of certain public services, e.g., the British Transport Commission Police,
the Civil Aviation Constabulary, the Port of London Authority Police and other
dock and harbour forces (who, although not subject to the supervision of the Home
Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland, have duties and pow7ers analogous
to those of ordinary constables but limited to the premises and immediate neigh¬
bourhoods of their employers), the police of the defence services, i.e. the Admiralty
Constabulary, the War Department Constabulary, which guards War Office lands
and military property, the Royal Marine Police, who are employed chiefly in dock¬
yards, and the Air Ministry Constabulary.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages
of 19 and 30, although an exception may be made in the case of ex-regular Navy,
Army and Air Force men of over 30 years of age. Women entrants in England
and Wales must be between the ages of 20 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and
30 years old. The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
police district, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and con¬
stable. The following intermediate ranks may also be adopted where the field of
operations renders them necessary: assistant chief constable, chief superintendent,
chief inspector and, in England and Wales only, subdivisional inspector, station
sergeant and acting sergeant. In the Metropolitan police district the chief officer is
the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. He is assisted by a Deputy Com¬
missioner and four Assistant Commissioners. Next in rank are commanders, then
deputy commanders; thereafter the ranks are the same as in the rest of the country.
In the City of London the ranks are the same as in the provinces except that the
chief officer is called the Commissioner of Police and the second in command is an
Assistant Commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a basic
principle of the service that its members must not only be free from political bias,
but must also be seen to be free of it. The Police Act, 1919, however, laid it down
that the police should have a statutory representative organization of their own.
This is known in England and Wales as the Police Federation and in Scotland
as the Scottish Police Federation and all constables, sergeants and inspectors belong
to it. Any part of the organization can make representations to the police authority,
to the chief officers of police, or, in England and Wales, to the Secretary of State
for the Home Department and, in Scotland, to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Delegates from the Joint Central Committees of the two Federations sit on the
Police Council.
Police Duties
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office.
His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common law, are
exercised by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself. Thus, unless acting in pursuance of a magistrate’s
warrant, a police officer is liable for any wrongful or mistaken action on his part,
even if in committing such an action he is obeying the orders of the police authority;
for he is not the servant of the police authority, and in discharging his duties
must rely on his own discretion and his own knowledge of the law.
The manifold functions of a police officer as a constable range from road or street
government and ADMINISTRATION 83
patrolling and traffic control to arresting persons committing offences or (in certain
cases) under suspicion of acting in an unlawful way. In England and Wales (although
not in Scotland where the police investigate cases and report to the prosecutor) the
police are responsible for initiating, and in most cases conducting, prosecutions,
except those which must be dealt with by the Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e.
if the offence is punishable by death; or when an offence is referred to him by a
Government Department, subject to his discretion; or in any case which appears
to the Director ‘to be of importance or difficulty or which for any reason requires
his intervention’.
In addition to their duties as constables, police officers are sometimes appointed,
usually by the local authority, to be inspectors under an Act of Parliament; as such’
their duties may include the inspection of weights and measures, and investigation
into diseases of animals.
Police Cadets
Many police forces offer free training and paid work in police offices and stations
to boys between school-leaving age and the age at which they are called up for
National Service. Selection is limited to boys who are likely to become useful
members of the Force. On completing their full-time National Service the cadets
are eligible for appointment as constables. One police force has a similar cadet
scheme for girls.
POLICE IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The Royal Ulster Constabulary
The general control of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which is a State Force, is
vested in an Inspector-General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
The cost of the force is met from the Northern Ireland Exchequer, the County
Borough of Belfast contributing a token sum of £25,000 annually towards the cost
of policing the City of Belfast.
The present strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 2,900
officers and men. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the lines of the
police service in Great Britain, the general duties pertaining to the tasks being
similar in all respects.
In addition to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, there exists in Northern Ireland an
auxiliary police force called the Ulster Special Constabulary, which is also under
the general control and direction of the Inspector-General. In the main, this force
is a part-time force and its duties cover training and assistance to the regular force
on special occasions. If necessary, however, its part-time personnel may be
mobilized for full-time duty and its duties extended to cover ordinary police duties.
The present strength of the Special Constabulary is approximately 10,000 officers
and men.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organized on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control exercised by the Secretary of State for the Home
Department (in England and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland (in
Scotland). The Fire Services in Northern Ireland are described on p. 86. Every
place throughout the United Kingdom is covered by a public fire brigade.
84
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
FIRE SERVICES IN GREAT BRITAIN
There are at present 135 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and
11 in Scotland.
Fire Authorities
The responsibility for fire fighting functions, which was vested in the two
Secretaries of State on a national basis as an emergency measure during the second
world war, was restored in 1948 to local government control under the Fire Services
Act, 1947. The effect of the Act was to transform the National Fire Service (estab¬
lished in 1941) into separate fire brigades administered, in England and Wales, by
the county or county borough councils, who were created the Fire Authorities for
their areas and were given powers and duties which they exercise either separately
or as Combined Authorities where neighbouring councils care to make such
arrangements to increase the efficiency of the service. The Act provides that each
Fire Authority which is a county council (except London) must establish a Fire
Brigade Committee, consisting of both county council members and representatives
of the county district councils in the county, to deal on the county council’s behalf
with matters concerning fire prevention and control. In Scotland, the local authori¬
ties are grouped in eleven areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of
Glasgow, where the town council of the city is the responsible authority, each area
is administered by a Joint Committee representative of the councils of the counties
and large burghs in the area.
Central Control
The Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are empowered to make regulations prescribing such matters as conditions
of service, standards of efficiency and the organization of training in the local fire
brigades. In matters affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding regulations
about conditions of service and similar matters) each Secretary of State is advised
by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the
Fire Authorities, representatives of the Chief Officers and other members of
the brigades, and other persons having special qualifications for the purpose. The
Advisory Councils are not concerned with the conditions of service of members of
the brigades. On these subjects the Secretaries of State are advised by the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain and the National
Joint Council for Chief Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great
Britain.
Central control is also exercised through the Inspectors of Fire Services, whose
duties include advising the Secretaries of State on technical matters. In 1954 there
were 10 inspectors and assistant inspectors in England and Wales and 1 inspector
and an assistant inspector in Scotland.
Establishment Schemes
Each Fire Authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and loca¬
tion of fire stations and the number and type of vehicles and appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Details of establishment
schemes, which must be approved by each Secretary of State for his own country,
vary considerably according to the fire risks in the area concerned; but in an English
county of about 1 million acres and a mixed urban and rural population of some
ij million, for example, there might be between 70 and 80 whole-time and
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 85
part-time fire stations equipped with between 200 and 250 vehicles and appliances
and served by a whole-time force of approximately 700 and a part-time force
of approximately 950 officers and men.
Operational Methods
Each Fire Authority is required to appoint a Chief Officer (Firemaster in
Scotland) to be the chief administrative and executive officer for the fire services in
its area. The appointment must be ratified in England and Wales by the Secretary
of State for the Home Department and in Scotland by the Secretary of State for
Scotland. The Chief Officer or Firemaster is responsible to the Fire Authority for
seeing that both the fire brigade and the fire department (which is the administra¬
tive centre and staff headquarters for the fire brigade) are organized and managed
in accordance with policy laid down.
Operational control is centralized at headquarters; but it is generally exercised
on a more local basis by divisional officers, in charge of geographical divisions into
which most areas are divided for the purpose. Each divisional officer has at his
disposal a small staff of whole-time, and a varying number of part-time, officers
and men; and he is responsible for mobilizing this force in the strength necessary
for dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters; and if at any time an
outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a divisional force, help is
sent from one or more neighbouring divisions in its area, or even from the area of
another Fire Authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all Fire
Authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless of
area boundaries.
Firemen
Firemen in Great Britain include: whole-time firemen; part-time firemen—
either ‘retained’ firemen, who undertake, in return for a small retaining fee, to
attend fires if they are called upon to do so, or ‘volunteer’ firemen, who receive
no remuneration; auxiliary firemen, who are enrolled as part of the local authority
civil defence organization as members of individual brigades under the command
of Chief Officers or Firemasters, and whose activities are restricted (except in a
war emergency) to such duties as are desirable for training; and members of fire¬
fighting organizations with specialized functions, which are outside the scope of
the 1947 Act, e.g., those maintained by the War Office, the Air Ministry, the
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and by some of the more important
industrial and commercial concerns.
Ranks in the fire services of England and Wales (for men) are chief officer,
assistant chief officer, divisional officer, assistant divisional officer, station officer,
sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. In Scotland, they are firemaster, assistant
firemaster, divisional officer, column officer, senior company officer, company
officer, section leader, leading fireman, and fireman. Ranks in the women’s branch,
which is mainly concerned with controls, administrative duties and duties of a
clerical nature, are (for Great Britain as a whole) group officer, assistant group
officer, senior leading firewoman, leading firewoman, and firewoman. Promotion in
the lower ranks of the firefighting forces is by examination and by merit, and in the
higher ranks by merit only.
Training for full-time firemen in England and Wales includes practical and
theoretical instruction given to recruits at a training school, which is run either by
the Fire Authority itself or by a neighbouring Authority, and refresher courses for
86
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
firemen, arranged by Fire Departments. The training of recruits and junior ranks
in Scotland is carried out at a central training school which is the responsibility
of the Scottish Home Department. Courses for officers and potential officers
of Fire Authority brigades are held at the Fire Service College, at Wotton
House, near Dorking, Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and
the Scottish Home Department as the central training institution for the fire
services.
Finance
Every Fire Authority is required to submit to the Home Secretary or to the
Secretary of State for Scotland an annual statement showing its expenditure and
income in connection with the provision of fire services during the preceding year.
The Government pays a grant of 25 per cent of the net expenditure approved by
the Home Office or the Scottish Home Department, less an annual contribution
towards the expenses of the Fire Service College; the rest of the money is raised
from local authority funds.
Research
The principal means by which research on fire prevention and firefighting is
carried on is the Joint Fire Research Organization, the cost of which is shared
equally between the Government and the Fire Offices’ Committee (a Committee
of the Insurance Companies dealing in fire risks). The Organization makes con¬
tinuing research into all aspects of fire prevention and firefighting and controls a
Fire Research Station at which practical tests are carried out.
FIRE SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
The Fire Authorities in Northern Ireland, as established by the Fire Services
(Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, are the Belfast Corporation, which
controls the Belfast Fire Brigade and is responsible for the area inside the city
boundary, and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which covers the rest of the
country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains four whole-time stations and has an establish¬
ment of 178 officers and men manning 11 appliances, while the Northern Ireland
Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry and 42 other stations
throughout the remainder of the area, and an establishment of 92 whole-time
officers and men and 684 part-time firemen, manning 61 appliances.
Ranks of Firemen
The ranks of firemen in Northern Ireland are: for the Northern Ireland
Fire Authority—fire force commander, divisional officer, assistant divisional
officer, senior company officer, company officer, section leader (retained brigades
only), leading fireman and fireman; and for the Belfast Fire Brigade—chief
officer, divisional officer grade 2, divisional officer grade 3, assistant divisional
officer, station officer, sub-officer, leading fireman and fireman. There are
only a few women in the Northern Ireland Fire Services, all of the rank of fire-
woman.
Finance
The Fire Services (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland), 1953, passed in
December 1953, provides that for the three financial years commencing 1st April
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION 87
I953 the Northern Ireland Fire Authority may receive a Fire Service Grant made
up of 50 per cent of loan charges in respect of capital expenditure, subject to a
maximum of £22,500, together with 50 per cent of the first £110,000 of non-capital
expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess over that amount. The expenditure in
excess of the Fire Service Grant will, as hitherto, be apportioned among the local
authorities. The Belfast Fire Brigade, however, cannot qualify under the Fire
Services Acts for the payment of Fire Service Grant.

III. DEFENCE
THE DEFENCE SYSTEM
Organization
Britain’s defence policy is the responsibility of the Minister of Defence, who,
under the general direction of the Cabinet, of which he is a member, is answerable
for the ‘formulation and general application of a unified policy relating to the
armed forces of the Crown as a whole and their requirements’.
The higher direction of each of the three fighting Services is on similar lines.
Supreme control is in the hands of Parliament, which makes annual financial provi¬
sion for defence needs. By limiting provision to the current year, Parliament ensures
an annual review of the state of each Service. It is then that the Minister must
present his Estimates, expound his plans and defend his actions.
The Minister of Defence answers for all matters of policy common to the three
Services and their supply. Each of the three Service ministers, the First Lord of the
Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War (who deals with the Army), and the
Secretary of State for Air, is responsible to Parliament for the administration of his
own Service; each is assisted by a junior minister or ministers and by the permanent
civil servant at the head of his Department. The Chiefs of Staff Committee, which
comprises the professional heads of the three Services, is responsible for preparing
and advising upon strategic plans and policy for consideration by the Cabinet.
In addition to his co-ordinating functions as outlined above, the Minister of
Defence also has ministerial responsibility for certain inter-Service organizations
such as Amphibious Warfare Headquarters, the Joint Intelligence Bureau and the
Imperial Defence College.
Co-operation between the fighting Services is illustrated in the system of staff
training for selected officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force. After about 10
years’ service, they are sent to separate staff colleges at Greenwich, Camberley and
Bracknell (or Andover) respectively, where they learn the elements of staff work.
At a later stage in their careers some of them go to the Joint Services Staff College
at Chesham, where they live and work together and where particular attention is
paid to the specialist inter-Service aspects of staff work. This College caters for
about a hundred students a year from the Navy, Army and Air Force, the Civil
Service and the Commonwealth. Finally, there is the Imperial Defence College,
which caters for a few specially selected more senior officers from the Services,
the Civil Service and the Commonwealth.
Policy and Finance
As a member both of the Commonwealth and of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Britain has defence responsibilities which are almost world-wide. In
the fulfilment of these obligations and for the purpose of deterring aggression,
Britain embarked in 1951 on a programme for building up her armed forces, which
aimed at increasing both manpower and supplies of armaments and equipment.
The period of full-time National Service1 had been increased from 18 months to
2 years in 1950, and between 1950 and 1954-55 annual defence expenditure rose
1 The National Service Act, 1948, which became operative on 1st January 1949,
imposes a liability on every male British subject ordinarily resident in Great Britain (subject
to specified exceptions) who has attained the age of 18 but has not attained the age of 26
years for a period of whole-time service in the regular forces and a term of part-time
service in an auxiliary force (see pp. 92 and 94).
88
DEFENCE
89
from £777 million to some £ 1,640 million and the strength of the regular and reserve
forces increased from 827,000 to nearly 1 £ million.
Since its inception, the programme has been subject to periodic reviews in the
light of changing conditions, and in 1952 it was announced by Mr. (now Sir Winston)
Churchill that in order to keep it within the limits of national economic strength,
some modifications had been made and rearmament would be spread over a longer
period. This reorganization of the programme initiated the policy of ‘the long haul’.
In carrying out this policy, the Government intends to maintain the defence
effort at the maximum which the nation’s economic capabilities permit. It is still
necessary to hold a careful balance between the demands of defence and those of
other sections of the economy and, in particular, to ensure by close co-operation
with Britain s allies that Britain s share of the common burden does not impose an
undue strain upon her balance of payments. At the same time it is the Government’s
aim progressively to increase the efficiency of the armed forces and to take advantage
of all new developments likely to increase fighting strength and to promote economy
of effort. Defence research and development continues to have high priority and the
expenditure on it will increase, though this will be kept within bounds by concentra¬
tion on projects of the highest importance. Still greater emphasis is being placed on
the Royal Air Force. Subject to commitments and obligations, it is the Government’s
aim gradually to reduce the total size of the Army and to reconstitute the strategic
reserve at home. In his Budget speech on 6th April 1954 the Chancellor of the
Exchequer emphasized the need to obtain some definite relief from the defence burden.
The total Defence Estimates for the Service Departments for 1954-55 amount to
£1,639-9 million. This compares with a total of £1,636-76 million planned for
I953~54- Actual expenditure in 1953-54 was> however, £132 million less than was
originally estimated, owing mainly to delays in deliveries. The figure for 1954-55
includes provision for expenditure representing £85-36 million of the sterling
equivalent of aid from the United States of America.1 In addition, £113-5 million is
estimated for defence preparations under civil votes, mainly for civil defence and
strategic reserve (see p. 92).
The allocation between the various Services for the two years is shown in Table 5.

The figures for defence expenditure given in this table allow for the sterling
counterpart of United States defence aid, and exclude expenditure on civil
defence, industrial capacity (defence) and strategic reserves. Estimated expendi¬
tures under these heads in 1954-55 are> respectively, £38-5 million, £20-2 million
and £54-8 million, a total of £113'5 million.
Defence expenditure without allowing for the sterling counterpart of United
States aid represents about two-fifths of total estimated ordinary Government
expenditure ‘above the line’. At present it is taking about one-eighth of the gross
national product and involves the United Kingdom in the spending of about
£3oo-£35° million of foreign exchange a year.
Strength
Each of the three Services—Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force—is made
up of a substantial nucleus of regulars in addition to men called up under the
National Service Acts. Each has a supporting force of reserve and auxiliary forces.
Fit male British subjects between the ages of 18 and 26 must (with certain limited
exceptions) serve for two years in one of the armed forces. After this period of full¬
time service they must serve for a period of three and a half years with one of the

and other establishments operated by the Admiralty and the Ministry of Supply.

95
At the beginning of the second world war three Royal Ordnance Factories were in
operation, at its peak there were 44- There are now 23. The Ministry of Supply’s
research establishments carry out research on behalf of all three Services and naval
research is also conducted by the Admiralty. Production of and research on atomic
warheads to meet Service requirements are carried out by the Atomic Energy
Authority (see p. 34$) under contract from the Ministry of Supply, which is
responsible for the completed weapons.
In addition, some military equipment, including aircraft and radio and radar
equipment, is being supplied to Britain by the United States under the Mutual
Security Programme. Some of this equipment is manufactured in the United
Kingdom and financed by the United States under the ‘offshore procurement’
programme. Under this programme the United Kingdom is also making equipment
for other NATO countries in Europe. A number of jet fighter aircraft have been
supplied to the Royal Air Force as a joint Canadian-United States project.

Guided missiles have reached an advanced stage of development. An air-to-air
weapon will be the first to come into service and surface-to-air weapons will follow.
Atomic Weapons
Atomic weapons are in production in Britain and delivery to the forces has begun.
THE ROYAL NAVY
The Royal Navy is governed by the Board of Admiralty. The First Lord of the
Admiralty is the minister responsible to Parliament for the Navy. The other ten
members of the Board are the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary; the Civil
Lord; the Permanent Secretary, who is a civil servant and responsible for the
general conduct of Admiralty business; the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval
Staff; the Second Sea Lord and Chief of Personnel; the Third Sea Lord and
Controller of the Navy, responsible for engineering, equipment, ordnance, and
research; the Fourth Sea Lord and Chief of Supplies and Transport; the Fifth Sea
Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (Air), responsible for air matters; the Vice-
Chief of Naval Staff, responsible for operations, intelligence and plans; and the
Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, responsible for special subjects.
Strength
The strength of the Fleet, excluding attendant ships and numerous small craft,
consisted in 1954 of nearly 600 vessels, falling into the various categories of battle¬
ships, fleet and light fleet carriers, cruisers, Daring class ships, destroyers, frigates,
monitors, submarines, minesweepers and fast minelayers. These are divided between
the active fleets, those employed on training and experimental purposes, and those
in varying categories of reserve, including those preparing for service.
Production and Equipment
The emphasis of the naval production programme has for some years been
placed on the building up and modernizing of the anti-submarine and anti-mine
forces and on the construction of additional aircraft carriers, all of which will have
‘angled’ decks, steam catapults and the latest arrester gear. These new features, all
British ideas, are also being installed in carriers now in service. Progress is being
made with the building of frigates, minesweepers (coastal and inshore) and seaward
defence boats. Modernization of the Fleet, including the submarine force, goes on
96
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
continually. Two squadrons of fast anti-submarine frigates converted from
destroyers are now with the Active Fleet. New submarines are being laid down and
existing submarines modernized. Besides orthodox submarines, experimental craft
using high test peroxide propulsion to provide high underwater speed are being
developed.
Research and Development
The main effort in the programme of naval research and development, as in the
production programme, continues to be directed towards anti-submarine, anti¬
mine and anti-aircraft problems.
Much work has been done on propulsive machinery with good results. The
Deltic, an internal combustion engine of advanced design and power-weight ratio,
is in production and an improved type of marine gas turbine is being used in a
motor torpedo boat to gain further experience of this type of machinery at sea.
Modern chemical theory is being successfully applied to improvement of the effi¬
ciency of the steam plants which provide power for the larger units of the Fleet,
and current research is expected to make possible greater unbroken operational
periods at sea, economy of skilled maintenance staff, and savings in running
costs.
Fleet Air Arm
The Fleet Air Arm is being re-equipped with jet and turbo-prop aircraft and
Sea Hawk day fighters, and Wyvern strike aircraft are in service. A number of
Avenger anti-submarine aircraft, received from the United States, are being used
to bridge the gap until Gannets (anti-submarine search and strike aircraft) are in
service. Further deliveries are being made of aircraft fitted with airborne early
warning radar.
Stations
The Navy’s commands in home waters are Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham,
Rosyth in Scotland, and the Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet. Abroad there is the
Mediterranean Station with headquarters in Malta and with Gibraltar as a secon¬
dary base. This station covers the Red Sea (but not Aden) as well as the Mediter¬
ranean. The East Indies Station is practically co-extensive with the Indian Ocean.
By agreement with Ceylon, the Navy has a base and dockyard facilities at Trinco-
malee which are maintained by the United Kingdom. The Far East Station, formerly
known as the China Station, extends to the east of Singapore. Hong Kong remains
the operational base but the headquarters have now been moved to Singapore.
British naval aid to United Nations action in Korea was based on this station.
Largest in area of the stations is the America and West Indies Station, with head¬
quarters at Bermuda. From this station ships operate in both the North and South
Atlantic and in the Eastern Pacific, except where the Royal Canadian Navy
operates from Halifax and Esquimalt (Vancouver Island). By agreement with the
Union of South Africa the headquarters of the South Atlantic Station are at
Simonstown, near Cape Town. The navies of other Commonwealth nations
operate in their respective areas from their home bases, the use of which may be
made available to the Royal Navy at the discretion of their Governments.
The main Fleet bases at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham, Malta, Trincomalee,
Simonstown and Singapore are also dockyards for the Navy. Rosyth, Gibraltar and
Hong Kong are dockyards with major repair facilities. There are also a number of
naval air stations at home and abroad.

Royal Marines
The Corps of Royal Marines is a body of trained men for service on sea or land.
Its official existence dates from 1664. The present-day functions of the Corps are:
1. To supply detachments for HM ships, which (a) man a proportion of the
ships’ armament, (b) provide emergency landing parties, (c) carry out guard
duties and the like.
2. To act as Commando units.
3. To provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other parties required
for amphibious assault.
Women’s Royal Naval Service
The WRNS is now a permanent and integral part of the Naval Service. It has its
own disciplinary code. The estimated average strength in 1954-55 is 4,600.
Auxiliary Forces
Royal Fleet Reserve
The RFR consists of men who have taken their discharge from the regular
service and who, either voluntarily or as part of their contract, join this reserve for
a minimum period of five years. During 1954-55 maximum strength is estimated at
20,000.
Royal Naval Reserve
The RNR (officers and men of the Merchant Navy) reopened its ranks again in
February 1950 for volunteers to serve in the Royal Navy in war. The qualification
for service in the RNR is that the candidate should be following the sea as a profes¬
sion. Provision has been made in 1954-55 for a maximum strength of 1,340 officers
and 3,000 ratings.
Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve
The RNVR (officers and men who voluntarily train in peace time) is organized in
12 divisions which provide training for general naval service. There are also 10
RNVR Air Squadrons. The Royal Naval Volunteer (Wireless) Reserve consists of
specialist officers, wireless operators and radio electricians. During 1954-55 provi¬
sion is made for a maximum RNVR strength of 12,250 and also for 600 RNVR
officers doing national service.
Royal Marines Forces Volunteer Reserve and Women’s Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve
The RMFVR and WRNVR are the Royal Marines’ and WRNS’s counterparts
of the RNVR.
General Reserves
Behind these fully trained reserves, available to meet immediate needs on
mobilization, is the vast background of officers and men with past war-time and
peace-time service in the Royal Navy now either in retirement or in civil occupations.
All those still fit for service are liable to recall on the outbreak of war and, after
refresher training where necessary, would help to provide the additional trained
manpower required to meet the war-time expansion of the Navy as a whole.
Royal Naval Minewatching Service
The RNMWS, a voluntary civilian organization formed in January 1952, is
responsible in time of w ar for manning posts around the coast and overlooking the

main navigable waterways. Its object would be to spot mines dropped from air¬
craft, and to plot and report their positions. Its strength on 31st March 1954 was
3,7oo.
Sea Cadet Corps
The Sea Cadet Corps is the oldest pre-Service movement for boys in Britain,
its origin dating from the time of the Crimean War in the mid-nineteenth century.
As an organization it was sponsored in 1899 by the Navy League (the objects of
which are the promotion of a strong Navy and instruction in the history and tradi¬
tions of the sea). The aim of the Sea Cadet Corps is to give technical training to, and
instil naval tradition in, boys under the age of 18 who intend to serve in the Royal
and Merchant Navies and also to those sea-minded boys who do not intend to follow
a sea career but will, given this knowledge, form a valuable reserve for the Navy. It
also aims to provide for the social and educational welfare of the cadets and to
develop character and good citizenship. The estimated strength in 1954-55 is about
2,000 cadet officers, 1,100 chief petty officer instructors and 22,000 cadets.
THE ARMY
The control of the Army is vested in the Army Council, of which the Secretary
of State for War is president. The other civilian members of the Council are the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and Financial Secretary of the
War Office, who performs parliamentary duties; and the Permanent Under-Secre¬
tary of State for War, a civil servant who acts as secretary to the Council. The
military members of the Army Council comprise the Chief of the Imperial General
Staff, who is responsible for strategic policy and plans, operation, intelligence and
training, and is also a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (see p. 88); the
Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff; the Deputy Chief of the General Staff,
responsible for war organization, equipment, and weapons; the Adjutant-General
to the Forces, responsible for manpower, personnel, discipline, medical services,
welfare, education, and the women’s services; and the Quartermaster-General to
the Forces, responsible for supplies, transport, and works services.
Disposition and Strength
The Army is an instrument of Britain’s commitments as a world power and as
a member of the United Nations, of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and
of the British Commonwealth. There were in the spring of 1954, 4 divisions (3 of
them armoured) in Germany,1 in addition to 1 brigade in Berlin, 1 brigade in
Trieste2 and a number of troops in Austria. In Korea and Japan there were 20,000
men3; in Malaya, 23 battalions (including Gurkha and Colonial battalions); in
Kenya, 11 battalions (including Colonial forces), and in the Suez Canal Zone,
1 The United Kingdom Government undertook, at the Nine-Power London Conference
in October 1954 (if the agreements reached were accepted by all the national parliaments),
to continue to station four divisions and a Tactical Air Force on the Continent, and not
to withdraw them against the wishes of the majority of the Brussels Treaty powers.
This was subject to one reservation to cover the possibility of some grave emergency
overseas, and one condition to take care of possible financial difficulties.
2 In accordance with the terms of a Memorandum of Agreement between the Govern¬
ments of Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States and Yugoslavia, British troops
were withdrawn from Trieste in October 1954.
3 The United Kingdom land forces in Korea form part of the Commonwealth Division
which is being reduced by two-thirds.

2 divisions and i brigade.1 In addition to these, there were the Gibraltar, Malta,
Cyrenaica (^nd Tripoli), Cyprus, Akaba, and Hong Kong garrisons. There was
also a battalion in the West Indies and i in British Guiana. At home there are the
Territorial Army, other reserve forces and Home Guard, and certain elements of
the Regular Army.
Equipment
Attention is being concentrated on the production of tanks and other armoured
vehicles, infantry weapons, engineers’ and signal equipment, and intensive study
has been given to the defensive and offensive aspects of the introduction of atomic
weapons.
The Regular Army is fully equipped with the Centurion tank which has also been
supplied to allied countries. The heavy gun tank, the Conqueror, is in limited
production. Complementary to the Centurion, it is larger, more powerfully armed
and more heavily armoured. Its suspension is of a new and improved design. Great
progress has been made with the development of a new scout car and a new six-
wheel armoured personnel carrier of very modern unorthodox design, and the
first heavy tracked vehicle to be powered by a gas turbine has been developed.
Among artillery weapons is a new light anti-aircraft gun for defence against low-
flying aircraft and the most recent infantry equipment includes the Energa grenade,
the 3-5-inch rocket launcher and the Patchett sub-machine gun.
It has been decided that the new rifle for the British Army shall be the Belgian
FN.300, which may also be adopted by other NATO countries.
Production of engineering equipment includes a new girder bridge, capable of
carrying the heaviest tanks in the Service, a new light assault floating bridge and a
heavy ferry. A new and more powerful range of mines, needed for dealing with
heavier tanks, and a speeded-up mechanical minelayer are now in service.
Trials have taken place and production is starting on a large range of new wireless
sets for the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Artillery and the Infantry.
Organization of the Regular Army
The Army is organized in twenty-five corps or arms, which include the Royal
Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry Regiments—Dragoons, Hussars, Lancers—
and the Royal Tank Regiment), Artillery, Engineers, Signals, Infantry, and various
other corps such as the Royal Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance
Corps, the Royal Army Medical Corps, etc. The Infantry has been reorganized
since 1946 in the following groups:
1. The Grenadier Guards, The Coldstream Guards, The Scots Guards, The
Irish Guards, The Welsh Guards.
2. The Royal Scots, The Royal Scots Fusiliers, The King’s Own Scottish
Borderers, The Cameronians.
3. The Queen’s Royal Regiment, The Buffs, The Royal Fusiliers, The East
Surrey Regiment, The Royal Sussex Regiment, The Queen’s Own Royal
West Kent Regiment, The Middlesex Regiment.
1 Under the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement signed on 19th October 1954 the withdrawal
of these forces is to be completed within twenty months. The Government had previously
stated, in July 1954, that part of the forces released will be used to build up a strategic
reserve in the United Kingdom.
The small British force in the Sudan is, under the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of
February 1953, to be withdrawn at the close of the transitional period of self-government
when the Sudanese Parliament has passed a resolution expressing its desire that arrange¬
ments for self-determination be put in motion.

Women’s Royal Army Corps
The WRAC, which has replaced the ATS, is a corps in the Regular Army, the
officers and other ranks of which, with minor exceptions and modifications, are
subject to the Army Act and Queen’s Regulations to the same extent as members
of any other corps.
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps
The QARANC, which has replaced the QAIMNS, is a corps of the Regular
Army and provides the nursing services within the Army. It numbers about 2,150.
Territorial Army
The Territorial Army was reconstituted in 1947 and now forms part of the
national Army. Its role on the outbreak of war would be: to provide most of the
anti-aircraft1 and coast defences of the country and the reinforcements in those
arms required at ports and airfields overseas; to provide, with the active army, a
field force wherever required; and to support the civil defence organization in its
task of minimizing the effects of enemy air attack.
1 The development of nuclear and other new weapons has radically affected the problems
of air defence, and the scale of anti-aircraft gun defences is therefore to be reduced.
DEFENCE
IOI
From the outbreak of war the Regular and Territorial Armies would be inte¬
grated. In the United Kingdom the combined resources of Regular and Territorial
units would be used together to meet initial operational requirements and to pro-
vide the framework of subsequent expansion.
The Territorial Army is to be brought up to the equivalent of 12 TA divisions
which should be able to take the field after a short period of formation training
following mobilization. The TA consists of armoured, infantry and airborne
divisions, certain independent brigades, and anti-aircraft and coastal artillery units
together with Corps and Army troops and administrative units. Its backbone is the
volunteer, but from October 1950 an increasing proportion of its strength has been
National Service men doing their compulsory term of three and a half years’ part-
time service in its ranks. The strength of the Territorial Army in the spring of 1954
was nf divisions, consisting of 60,000 volunteers and 192,000 part-time men.
Army Emergency Reserve
The object of the Army Emergency Reserve is, broadly, to provide the technical
and administrative units needed to form the essential backing to the fighting forma¬
tions of the Regular Army and of the Territorial Army immediately on mobilization.
The Army Emergency Reserve is not part of the Territorial Army but an essential
complement to it. In structure its units are similar to those of the Territorial Army
in that they consist of basic elements of volunteers to provide the senior officers and
NCOs, completed ultimately with National Service men during their part-time
service, but the units are raised on a trade or "skill’ basis and not territorially.
Army Cadet Force
The ACE was founded some 90 years ago. Its objects are pre-Service training
for boys between the ages of 14 and 18 and the encouragement of club life, games,
etc. In the 1954-55 Estimates provision is made for about 6,270 officers and 126,000
cadets, of whom about three-fifths are in the Combined Cadet Force, which is
organized in schools.
The Home Guard
The Home Guard, instituted during the second world war, was re-established on
a voluntary and limited basis by the Home Guard Act, 1951.
The tasks of the Home Guard in war time would be to guard vulnerable points,
particularly key factories and airfields, and to assist the civil defence organization
in the event of heavy air attack.
The force is open to men between 18 and 65, unless they are members of the
Regular forces, or of certain reserves, or of the Territorial Army. Women are
eligible for service as clerks and telephonists. Service is for two years and may be
extended for one year at a time. Service is part-time in times of peace, but members
of the Home Guard are required to give whole-time service in the United Kingdom
if the unit to which they belong is mustered to repel an invasion. There is no pay,
but allowances are made to cover subsistence, disablement, travelling, etc., at a flat
rate irrespective of rank. When on duty and mustered, members of the Home
Guard will be subject to military law, but no member would be tried under military
law for an offence which could come within the civil code.
The Home Guard was started as the Local Defence Volunteers in 1940 and was
afterwards named the Home Guard on the suggestion of the Prime Minister, Mr.
(now Sir Winston) Churchill. In the course of the war the organization reached a
strength of over if million. It held its ‘stand-down’ parade in December 1944.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE ROYAL AIR FORCE
The Royal Air Force is administered by the Air Council (a body similar in
organization to the Army Council), of which the Secretary of State for Air is
president. The Council also has five permanent and three additional members. Of
these, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Air acts as vice-president of the Air
Council and performs parliamentary duties; and the Permanent Under-Secretary
of State for Air, who is a civil servant, acts as secretary of the Air Council. The
military members of the Council include the Chief of the Air Staff, who is respon¬
sible for strategic policy and the fighting efficiency of the RAF and is also a member
of the Chiefs of Staff Committee; the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for
inter-Service policy, operations, intelligence, liaison with other air forces, stan¬
dardization and ground defence; the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, responsible for
the preparedness for war of the RAF, for command, staff and air training, and for
policy regarding future aircraft and weapons; the Air Member for Personnel; the
Air Member for Supply and Organization; and the Controller of Aircraft of the
Ministry of Supply.
Equipment
In the general defence effort still greater emphasis is being placed on the RAF,
which is concentrating on the modernizing and expanding of equipment in Britain
and Western Europe, while maintaining forces of high quality in the Middle and
Far East. Most of the changes and improvements are taking place with the prospect
of guided weapons ‘coming over the horizon’.
Concentration continues on the production of the most advanced types of aircraft
and equipment. The seven aircraft types to which super-priority has been accorded
are: the Hunter, Swift and Javelin (jet fighters), and the Canberra, Valiant, Vulcan
and Victor (jet bombers). A system has been introduced to shorten the development
time of new aircraft. Fighter Command is steadily being re-equipped with Swifts
and Hunters. Prototypes of a new supersonic fighter are in production and 20 pre-
production aircraft have been ordered.1 The re-equipment and expansion of
Bomber and Coastal Commands is continuing and the jet medium bomber
squadrons are being built up as quickly as production allows, with the aim of
providing a highly trained and flexible force for the exercise of air power. As the
four-engined strategic bombers, Valiant, Vulcan and Victor, come into service the
Canberra squadrons will be converted to the heavy type, but the twin-engined
Canberra will continue to give direct tactical support to Supreme Allied Command,
Europe.
New types of airborne radio and radar equipment are being delivered in con¬
siderable quantities and early-warning radar has been highly developed. Ground
organization has been speeded up and changes have been made in the system of
command to match the needs of operations that may often be conducted above the
speed of sound.
In the defensive field there will be guided weapons launched from aircraft
and from the ground. The former will supplement, but not supplant, aircraft
cannon.
1 The PI twin jet fighter, the first British aircraft designed to exceed the speed of
sound in level flight, made its maiden flight on 4th August 1954, and a new delta-winged
jet aircraft, built for research into supersonic speed in level flight, made its first flight on
6th October. Other supersonic types are in process of construction.

The Royal Air Force is organized into Commands administered by the Air
Council:
At Home. Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training, Technical
Training, Maintenance and Home (formerly known as Reserve)
Commands.
Overseas. Second Tactical Air Force (Germany), the Middle East Air Force
(headquarters in Cyprus) and the Far East Air Force (headquarters
at Changi, Singapore).
Commands are subdivided into groups and wings, a certain number of squadrons
being allotted to each group or wing. Squadrons are subdivided into flights.
Women’s Royal Air Force
Women play an important part in the work not only of the Royal Air Force but
of its reserve and auxiliary formations. The WRAP is a permanent and integral part
of the Royal Air Force and its members train with and work alongside airmen in
the same trades, serving not only in the United Kingdom but in Germany, the
Middle East and the Far East. The maximum strength in 1954-55 is estimated at
9,450-
Auxiliary and Reserve Forces
The Royal Air Force auxiliary and reserve formations, administered by Home
Command, are:
1. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force, which consists of units raised and main¬
tained by Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations. It includes flying
squadrons (fighter and air observation post), regiment squadrons and fighter
control and radar reporting units. Each trains and operates as a self-con¬
tained unit. The estimated strength in 1954-55 is 9,290.
2. The Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which provides a pool of officers,
airmen and airwomen, who, like the personnel of the Auxiliary Air Force,
train on a part-time basis, both as individuals and units.
3. The Air Training Corps, open to boys between the ages of 14 and 18, which
in i954-55 has an estimated average strength of 3,800 officers, 5,800 warrant
officers, and 41,500 cadets, and, like the other pre-Service formations, seeks
to inculcate citizenship as well as training for the RAF.
Royal Observer Corps
Nearly 20,000 men and women from all walks of life form the Royal Observer
Corps, a voluntary civilian organization, which is part of Fighter Command,
devoted to the specialized task of identifying and reporting the movements of air¬
craft. The corps originated in the first world war to report the movements of
German aircraft and zeppelins over Great Britain and was officially established in
1925.
CIVIL DEFENCE
Civil defence is a vital and integral part of Britain’s defence plans. Under the
Civil Defence Act, 1948, the Secretary of State for the Home Department (in
Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland) is given wide powers in relation to
civil defence which are applied by Regulations requiring the approval of Parliament.
H

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other Ministers may be designated under the Act to exercise powers with regard
to particular subjects, and the Ministers of Health, Food, Housing and Local
Government, Fuel and Power, and Transport and Civil Aviation have in this way
been designated to deal respectively with such matters as the casualty services and
care of the homeless1; emergency feeding; evacuation1; and the maintenance of
fuel and transport services in war time. In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Act
(NI), 1950, places on the Minister of Home Affairs the responsibility for organiza¬
tion of the various civil defence services.
Thus civil defence is the responsibility of a number of Ministers each of whom
undertakes the duties which, in war time, would represent a natural extension
of his peace-time functions. The Home Secretary is responsible for the civil defence
activities of the police and fire services,1 and he administers the Civil Defence
Corps and the Industrial Civil Defence Service as well as such matters as war-time
lighting restrictions, air-raid shelter policy and the civil air-raid warning system.
He has, in addition, the function of co-ordinating the civil defence work of all
Departments. This necessarily involves much interdepartmental work, and the
necessary committee organization for this purpose has been established at both
the ministerial and the official levels; this organization includes a Civil Defence
Joint Planning Staff, under Home Office chairmanship, on which all Departments
with civil defence responsibilities are represented. Through this organization the
Civil Defence plans and programmes are continually under review to take account
of changes in the scale and nature of possible attacks.
In September 1954 the Home Secretary announced the appointment to the
Home Office of a Director-General of Civil Defence, to co-ordinate the civil
defence work of the civil Departments concerned and to develop liaison with the
armed forces.
As the development of effective civil defence services involves much detailed
planning and organization at local level, the central Government has enlisted the
assistance of local government authorities, of industry and of public bodies of many
kinds, including voluntary organizations. Local progress in civil defence in England
and Wales is stimulated by Principal Officers of the Home Office in each of the
eleven civil defence regions.
To provide the personnel required in war for civil defence tasks the following
formations, in which in peace time only part-time service is required, are raised
by voluntary recruitment of civilians:
1. The Civil Defence Corps, which was created by Royal Warrant in May
1949.
2. The Industrial Civil Defence Service, which comprises civil defence units
formed in industrial and commercial premises.
3. The Auxiliary Fire Service, to reinforce the fire services maintained by
local authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1947.
4. The National Hospital Service Reserve, limited at present to trained nurses
and persons willing to be trained as nursing auxiliaries.
5. The Special Constabulary, to reinforce the police forces in all police
functions.
Apart from industrial civil defence the Civil Defence Corps is the only one of
these formations called upon to undertake tasks which have no peace-time equiva¬
lent. It is recruited and organized by certain local authorities (mainly the councils

cooking and feeding, public information centres.
Subject to restrictions regarding age and obligation to serve in the armed
forces, recruits for all formations are drawn from men and women who are willing
to serve as long as they are able and who will undertake to train approximately
five hours each month. They are not paid, but reasonable out-of-pocket expenses

Strengths in Great Britain at 30th September 1954 were:
1. Civil Defence Corps . . . . . . . . . . 338,153
2. Industrial Civil Defence Service . . . . . . 160,000
3. Auxiliary Fire Service . . . . . . . . . . 20,646
4. National Hospital Service Reserve . . . . . . 44,868
5. Special Constabulary (recruited since November 1949) 42,332
To provide central training in civil defence three residential technical training
schools are maintained by the Home Office. These are attended by persons
nominated by local authorities, industry and other organizations concerned
with civil defence, many of whom qualify as civil defence instructors. First-aid
instructors are provided in the main by the St. John Ambulance Brigade (in
Scotland, St. Andrew’s Ambulance Association) and the British Red Cross Society.
There is also a Civil Defence Staff College at Sunningdale in Berkshire, pro¬
viding courses for senior officials in all aspects of civil defence, and a Tactical
School to provide training for officers who will be in control of operations at or
near damaged areas. Courses in the civil defence aspects of fire-fighting are
provided for senior fire service officers at the Fire Service College, near Dorking,
in Surrey.
The Government is reviewing civil defence plans in the light of recent develop¬
ments in thermo-nuclear weapons. Techniques taught to members of the civil
defence services are in no way outmoded by new weapons, but there will be
changes in the emphasis of training. All Civil Defence Corps authorities have been
asked to appoint controllers-designate, and some local authorities have formed
themselves into larger groups for operational purposes. The Fire Service would
become a national organization in time of war. Chief regional fire officers-designate
have been appointed to assist in making plans. There will be even greater emphasis
on mobile organization based outside main areas of population, but available to
help them.
The problems of operating central reserves as tactical forces to help local
authorities have been under study for some years. An experimental mobile column,
manned by 150 officers and men of the Army and the Royal Air Force, was formed
io6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in January 1953 and disbanded in December 1953; another force of 150 officers
and men of the RAF was formed in January 1954. These columns have taken part
in a number of exercises with local authorities.
To provide for the manning of mobile columns in war the Government hopes to
bring a scheme into operation in the summer of I955> using selected RAF reservists.
The necessary statutory authority for the scheme is conveyed by the Civil Defence
(Armed Forces) Act, 1954, which extends the Civil Defence Act, 1948, so that the
responsible Ministers may arrange civil defence training for men undergoing
part-time national service, and contains a clause which declares that the duties
of members of the armed forces shall include civil defence. Three training
depots are being established under the scheme to provide training courses in
rescue work and firefighting.
IV. NATIONAL ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
The national economy of the United Kingdom offers to the rest of the world one
of its most concentrated markets, pajticularly for food and the raw materials for
industry. There are some 540 people to every square mile—eleven times as many
as in the United States and their standard of living is among the world’s highest.
But about half of their food is imported. They grow no cotton, rubber or jute,
possess little or no economically workable deposits of aluminium, lead, copper, tin
or zinc, and import four-fifths of their wood and their wool. The nation that
invented steel can now supply only half its needs of iron ore, and the pioneer of the
jet engine buys virtually all its crude oil from abroad.
Yet the national economy of Britain, using, as it does, mainly imported supplies,
is itself the second largest supplier of the world’s needs: of machinery, electrical
apparatus and vehicles; of fine quality textiles and pottery; of coal, chemicals and
cutlery; of whisky, jet aircraft and fertilizers. About half the world’s trade is
conducted in its currency; and in London are held the gold and dollar reserves of
the sterling Commonwealth and other sterling countries.
This economy is a part also of Western Europe: of the association of countries in
the Organization for European Economic Co-operation. As such it is a member of
the European Payments Union through which trade is facilitated, not only between
Western European countries but also between Western Europe and the whole of
the sterling area. It is also the second largest economy to belong to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, and is currently producing about a half of all the
defence goods made by the alliance on the eastern side of the Atlantic.
The general description of the economy which follows gives first an account of
its development up to the second world war and the effect of the war upon it; then
an analysis of the composition and distribution of the national income in recent
years; and finally a summary of the main economic tasks confronting the economy
today.
The Economy before 1939
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able to support
a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living. The increase of popu¬
lation and wealth continued, though more slowly, in the twentieth century, in spite
of increasing trade competition from other industrialized countries and the shocks
and financial losses occasioned by two world wars.
The period from 1870 to 1890 was the high-water mark of British industrial
expansion as compared with that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing
industrial competition from Europe and America began to make itself felt, but its
effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal,
were offset by the general rise in world trade, by the continued demand for British
textiles from India and other eastern countries, and by the continued high level of
oversea investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and Japan,
where labour costs were lower, established themselves firmly in the large eastern
markets, to a great extent replacing the higher-priced and often higher quality
107
I08 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British product. The extension of the world demand for coal was slowed down by
the increasing use of new fuels from oil, while coal from the new European mines
competed severely with British coal.
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of indus¬
tries, e.g., locomotives, ships and textile machinery, world demand fell away after
a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to gain a compensating share of
the expanding world trade in the new types of engineering products, e.g., cars and
electrical goods. Most countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some
sought deliberately to protect nascent and even established industries by sheltering
them behind tariffs and (later) quotas and exchange restrictions.
Income from oversea investments and a substantial improvement in the terms of
trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned the effect of a
fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high. The loss of export
markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple industries—coal, cotton,
iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering. The result was heavy
unemployment, the general rate of which averaged 14 per cent in the years 1921—39,
reaching a peak of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its
worst. In districts relying mainly on one of the staple industries, the rate was much
higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment took
place, stimulated by an increase in home investment, by some revival in world
trade and, after 1935, by the armament programme.
Effects of the Second World War
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic capital by
about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of
industrial maintenance and replacements. It also resulted in a considerable altera¬
tion in Britain’s financial and trading position, which may be summarized thus:
1. Loss of oversea assets. Over £ 1,000 million worth of oversea investments—
including £428 million in North America—were sold to pay for war supplies.
The income from these assets had paid for a substantial part of pre-war
imports into the United Kingdom.
2. New oversea debts. New external debts, totalling £3>000 million, were
accumulated.
3. Terms of trade. The price of imported raw materials rose sharply after the
war, and by 1948 about one-fifth more goods had to be exported than in
1938 to bring in the same quantity of imports.
4. Reduced exports. By 1944, exports, curtailed as part of the war effort, had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume.
5. Smaller reserves. The real value of the gold and dollar reserves was reduced
to about half the pre-war level.
6. World dollar shortage. The physical destruction of the war led to an increased
dependence on the part of Britain, the rest of the sterling area and many
other countries on supplies of all kinds from North America. Dollar earnings
by non-dollar countries were inadequate to pay for these supplies.
In the years after the war the United Kingdom made rapid progress in switching
its economy from a war-time to a peace-time footing. Industrial production climbed
rapidly: from 1946 (when it was at about the pre-war level) it rose at some 8 per
cent a year and by 1950 was nearly a third higher than in 1946. Bigger than average
gains were shown by the engineering, shipbuilding, electrical goods and vehicles
NATIONAL ECONOMY
109
industries. Supported by rising production, exports made swift progress: from an
end-war volume of about half pre-war, they had overtaken pre-war volume by
I947- The swift rise continued until 1950 when the volume was nearly two-thirds
greater than in 1947. Imports were restricted, and averaged a little below the
pre-war level.
Such a large increase in exports would not have been possible had it not been for
the restriction of home demand and the limitation of supplies to the home market.
In the post-war years average consumption per head remained at about the pre¬
war level, there having been a 6 per cent increase in population over the period
1939-52.
THE NATIONAL INCOME 1948-53
Size and Source
In national income per head (which is a very approximate measure of the stan¬
dard of living) the United Kingdom ranks in the second group from the top, together
with Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. (Only
the United States and Canada are in the top group.) From 1948 to 1953 the United
Kingdom gross national product (which is equivalent to the national income plus
depreciation) is estimated to have risen, in real terms, at a rate of about 3 per cent
per year; as a result, in 1953 the real national income was about 15 per cent higher
than in 1948. The money value of the gross national product in 19S3 was over /14A
thousand million.
The contribution of different industries to the total supplies of goods and services
produced in the United Kingdom has changed little over these years. Table 8
gives the average for 1948-52.

To these supplies from home production, imports added, on average, rather
more than one-fifth. The total supplies from home production and imports were
divided as follows:

The income of employees has increased more than the income from any other
source. Since employees’ incomes are on the average lower than other incomes, this
increase, together with the redistributive effects of taxation, has resulted in concen¬
trating the bulk of personal income after tax in the ranges of income of £250 to
£1,000 a year and, compared with 1938, greatly reducing the share taken by the
highest incomes (see Table 11).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There appears to have been a large rise in saving in the last two years, though
these figures are particularly uncertain. Personal consumption was divided between
different kinds of commodities as follows:

100
This division is influenced by the incidence of indirect taxes. Some foods are
subsidized, and drink and tobacco are very heavily taxed; expenditure on food is
thus a lower percentage of personal consumption, and expenditure on drink and
tobacco a higher percentage, than might otherwise be the case.
Government Income and Expenditure
The Government’s share in the total supplies available has been given above as
15 per cent. But the percentage of total incomes which the Government takes is
higher, since public authorities raise a considerable part of their income, not to
spend it on goods and services, but to redistribute as pensions or subsidies. If the
total income of the central Government, local authorities and the National Insur¬
ance Fund is compared with the total income received by everyone (including
companies) for work done, the percentage is about 40.

NATIONAL ECONOMY 113
^ 1 able 14 gives a summary of the way in which public authorities—the central
Government, local authorities, and the National Insurance Fund—collected and
spent their incomes in 1953.
A DEVELOPING ECONOMY
T he expansion of the national product after the second world war was accom¬
panied by rising productivity and a great increase in the volume of exports. In spite
of this increase there were recurrent payments crises in the immediate post-war
years, but there has been no such crisis since 1951. United Kingdom exports
dropped during 1952, largely as a result of import restrictions imposed by some
Commonwealth countries to correct their own balance of payments as part of a
concerted plan to strengthen sterling. United Kingdom exports recovered during
I953 (helped by progressive relaxations in the sterling area’s restrictions) so that,
while the total was much the same in both years, by the beginning of 1954 the level
was nearly back to that of April 1951. The gold and dollar reserves, which fell very
sharply from the middle of 1951 to early 1952, have since been recovering. They
continued to rise throughout seven months of recession in the United States to
reach, by the middle of 1954, a level more than halfway back to their June 1951
peak of £1,381 million.
I953 the United Kingdom ran a current balance of payments surplus of £2x1
million, including defence aid, compared with £242 million in 1952 (see p. 273).
A surplus is needed to repay oversea debt, to build up the gold and dollar
reserves, and to finance investment abroad. The demand for imports will go on
rising as production and incomes expand, and if an adequate surplus is to be main¬
tained the United Kingdom must increase its export earnings still further. The
United Kingdom Government has taken a leading part in organizing a move
towards a world-wide system of freer trade and payments, and in promoting the
further development of production in the sterling area—an essential element in the
expansion of world trade. At the Conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers
in January 1954 the Government undertook to continue making special efforts to
help provide capital for such development in the Commonwealth as would contri¬
bute towards strengthening the balance of payments of the sterling area.
In the United Kingdom itself the capacity for producing steel, chemicals and
capital goods has greatly increased, and among its currently most successful exporters
are industries which before the war played little or no part in United Kingdom
trade. Aircraft, radar equipment, agricultural tractors, office machinery and
petroleum products are examples of this development. Among the older industries
the motor trade has given an outstanding illustration of the possibilities of export
expansion, and pre-eminence has been maintained in such industries as wool goods,
pottery and bicycles.
Industrial production as a whole was higher in 1953 than ever before, and about
6 per cent higher than in 1952. Steel production was again a record, the target of
17^ million tons being exceeded. With the abandonment of restrictions on home
sales, more than 150,000 more cars were made in Britain than in 1952. The building
target of 300,000 houses was exceeded. Output in the chemicals and textiles
industries, which shared in the world recession of 1952, recovered in 1953. Net
output in agriculture in 1952-53 was 52 per cent above the pre-war level, and for
I953~54 is estimated at 56 per cent. In June 1954 unemployment was at the very
low figure of 1 -2 per cent of the total in civil employment in the United Kingdom.
Defence production has now levelled off, but remains a very heavy burden on
the economy. About one-quarter of the rise in production from 1952 to 1953 was
114 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
devoted to consumer goods. There was a slight increase in exports and in invest¬
ment in stocks; the housing programme was responsible for most of the rise in
fixed investment. There was a further stimulus to industrial investment in the 1954
Budget. In 1953 the initial depreciation allowances had been restored: in 1954 a
further step was taken with the introduction of investment allowances. These
constitute a tax-free allowance of 20 per cent of the value of any new plant and
machinery and 10 per cent of the value of industrial or agricultural buildings, in
addition to the ordinary allowances for depreciation.
V. INDUSTRY
ORGANIZATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom is one of the most highly industrialized countries in the
world. Ten people work in mining, manufacturing and building for every one in
agriculture.
Location
In the first half of the nineteenth century the principal factor in the location of
British manufacturing industry was coal, which then became the main source of
industrial heat and power. It was, however, by no means the only factor; raw
materials, such as iron ore in the West Midlands, West Cumberland, the Cleveland
Hills in Yorkshire, and elsewhere, and salt in Cheshire, had an important influence,
as did the availability of suitable labour, transport and water.
The rapid construction of the railway system between 1840 and 1880 greatly
facilitated the establishment and expansion of manufacture in many parts of the
country. During the present century the development of electric power and of
motor transport has further assisted the dispersal of industry. The dispersal has
come about both through outward growth of the older industrial areas and through
the establishment of factories in other towns, especially towns in the Midlands and
South of England. During the 1920s and 1930s the ‘drift to the south’ became very
marked. At the same time there was serious depression in many of the older indus¬
trial areas which depended on the traditional heavy industries. The Government of
the day therefore started to encourage new industries to set up in these older areas
and since 1945 special attention has been given to the needs of the Development
Areas (see p. 117). At the same time, prosperity has returned to the traditional
industries.
Industry is concentrated chiefly in eight areas:
London. In the nineteenth century London was not a major industrial centre,
though there was shipbuilding on Thames-side and the variety of consumer-goods
industries natural to a vast city. During the twentieth century, however, a growth
of industry, particularly in the western suburbs, has both accompanied and contri¬
buted to the phenomenal growth of Greater London. In addition to having building,
food and drink industries, London is the main centre in Britain of the clothing
industry, of printing, of the manufacture of furniture, of materials for the arts,
of precision instruments and of many other specialized goods. Small firms pre¬
dominate in all these industries, so that the average size of manufacturing firms
in London is well below the national average. London is also an important
centre for light engineering and has some heavy engineering. Indeed, London is so
large and its industries so diverse that it is a centre, if not the principal centre, for
many of the broad groups of manufacturing industries, with the notable exception
of textiles.
Midlands. The main Midland industrial area consists of the great conurbation
centred on Birmingham and Wolverhampton which includes portions of Stafford¬
shire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire, where there is a wide variety of industry,
including notably the manufacture of electrical and engineering goods and vehicles
but also jewellery and precision instruments, chemicals, rubber products and
domestic metalware. The smaller adjacent conurbation of North Staffordshire
centred on Stoke-on-Trent may be considered as a separate industrial area and is
n6
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
devoted chiefly to the manufacture of pottery and china and to the mining of coal.
Derby, Nottingham, Leicester and Coventry are the principal industrial towns in
the rest of the Midland area. There are several small coal deposits scattered
throughout the area, while a large coalfield runs north and east of Derby and
Nottingham.
Yorkshire. The West Riding of Yorkshire still contains much the bigger section
of the British woollen and worsted industry, though Leeds is now more concerned
with clothing and a variety of steel and engineering products. The modern woollen
and worsted industry lies farther west, at Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield. The
city of Sheffield, in the extreme south of Yorkshire, is famous for its high-quality
steel manufacture, its cutlery, plate and tool industry and its heavy engineering.
There are extensive coalfields in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
Lancashire. Manchester is the commercial centre of the cotton textile industry.
Most cotton yarn is spun in towns within a ten-mile radius of Manchester, but
weaving is mostly carried on somewhat farther to the north, in the Preston,
Burnley, Nelson, Blackburn and Colne areas. Manchester itself, besides having the
variety of industry typical of a large city, is one of Britain’s chief centres of electrical
and heavy engineering, while to the west of the city expanding chemical industries
have been developed. There are also coalfields in the Manchester area. The whole
region flanking the River Mersey is industrial as well as commercial; it is a
Development Area (see p. 117). Liverpool, besides being a port and produce market,
is, after London, the greatest centre of food preparation, while ship repairing is
carried on there and both shipbuilding and repairing on the other side of the river
at Birkenhead.
South Wales. Coalmining, including the production of such special coals as steam
coal and anthracite, has been and remains the chief industry of South Wales. The
other basic industry is steel, including tinplate, in which extensive modernization
is in progress. The largest steel plant in Europe was opened at Margam in July
1951. It has a capacity of i£ million ingot tons a year, most of which is converted
into sheet or sent to the great continuous strip mill at Trostre for conversion into
tinplate. New industries of many different types have been established in South
Wales since the war, providing nearly 100,000 new jobs, as well as diversifying the
industrial structure. There are four industrial estates (see p. 117), including the
pre-war estate at Treforest, and on these estates there are now some 350 industrial
undertakings including Government factories.
Tyneside. In Northumberland and Durham, near the River Tyne, coalmining is
the principal industry. This region also has steel and engineering industries: it is
one of Britain’s two greatest shipbuilding areas, the other being in Scotland. Most
of the shipyards are on the lower reaches of the rivers Tyne, Tees and Wear. Addi¬
tional employment and some degree of diversification have been introduced during
the post-war period by the establishment of new light industries in the Development
Area.
Scotland. The largest shipbuilding centre in Britain is on Clydeside. It has a
marine engineering industry and important neighbouring coalfields in the Lothians,
Fife and Lanark, although activity in this last field is now declining as the seams
are worked out. There is also a flourishing steel industry. The commercial impor¬
tance of Glasgow and the size and varied appointments of the great ships produced
on Clydeside have assured for this area a variety of manufactures. The whole of the
central lowlands of Scotland from the Clyde to the Forth is industrialized and
further industrial development has taken place since the war, particularly in the
Development Area, which includes Glasgow and the Lanarkshire coalfield.

Northern Ireland. Another important shipbuilding area is Belfast, in Northern
Ireland, even though it has no local supplies of coal and iron. It has, however, an
engineering industry, primarily marine engineering, and there is a growing aircraft
assembly industry. The traditional industries of Belfast are linen, rope and tobacco,
but many new industries have been introduced, particularly since the end of the
second world war.
Other Localized Industries. There are a number of other localized industries both
within and outside the main industrial areas, e.g., boots and shoes at Northampton
and Leicester; jute at Dundee; hosiery at Leicester and Nottingham; chemicals on
lees-side and Merseyside; cement on the Thames, Medway and Humber; glass
at St. Helens, Lancashire, and at Smethwick and Stourbridge, near Birmingham ;
carpets at Kidderminster, Halifax and Glasgow; tobacco in Bristol and Nottingham*
woollens in many of the Border towns of south Scotland and in Gloucestershire;
Imen in the towns of Northern Ireland; sugar confectionery in Yorkshire, Bristol
and Birmingham, shipbuilding and repairing at the main ports and up many of the
estuaries. There is also a wide range of industry scattered throughout the country,
mainly concerned with consumer goods and building and civil engineering.
Distribution of Industry Policy
Areas in Great Britain where there is likely to be a special danger of unemploy¬
ment may be scheduled by the Board of Trade as ‘Development Areas’ under the
Distribution of Industry Act, 1945. The purpose of this Act, and of the Distribu¬
tion of Industry Act, 195°) is t° promote the growth of new industry and the
expansion of existing industry in the Development Areas. The main advantages
which these Acts give to Development Areas are that the Board of Trade may build
factories for letting to suitable industry and the Treasury may help by making loans
or grants to undertakings which are unable to secure finance through normal
channels. The Board of Trade factories are built and managed by Industrial Estate
Companies. The directors of these companies are unpaid and are appointed by the
Board of Trade, and their capital is provided from Government sources. The
companies include North-Western Industrial Estates Ltd., North-Eastern Trading
Estates Ltd., Scottish Industrial Estates Ltd., Wales and Monmouthshire Industrial
Estates Ltd., and the West Cumberland Industrial Development Company Ltd.
There are Development Areas in the following parts of England and Wales: the
mining and coastal areas of Northumberland and Durham; West Cumberland;
South Wales and Monmouthshire; Wrexham; South Lancashire; Merseyside; and
North-East Lancashire, which became a Development Area in March 1953. In
Scotland the industrial area in and around the Clyde Valley, the Dundee area, and
part of the Highlands have been scheduled as the Scottish Development Area.
The Government cannot direct a firm to go to any particular area or site. But, in
addition to the special powers in scheduled Development Areas, the Board of Trade
has statutory powers under the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1947, to ensure
that new industrial development throughout Great Britain is carried out consistently
with the proper distribution of industry. A certificate to this effect is necessary
before planning consent may be given by a local planning authority (see p. 329) for
a new industrial building or extension with an area of over 5,000 square feet.
Of the 7,925 new factories and extensions to old ones, representing 168 million
square feet of factory space, built between 1st January 1945 and 31st March 1954,
38 per cent by factory space and 37 per cent by value were built in the Development
Areas.
The Industries Development Act (Northern Ireland), 1945, gives the Ministry
of Commerce of Northern Ireland similar powers in the whole of Northern Ireland.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

Government assistance is not limited to Development Areas: it is given to other
areas of high unemployment not listed as Development Areas. The Buckie-
Peterhead area in north-east Scotland, which is heavily dependent on the fishing
industry and has a hard core of unemployment, is not a Development Area but
arrangements have been made for it to receive help through the Development
Commission (see p. 343). The Commission has agreed to consider sympathetically
requests for help in building small factories for industrialists who are prepared to
go there.
Organization
The British economy is a mixed economy, in which both private and public
enterprise play a substantial part. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century,
the public sector tended to grow relatively to the private sector. This tendency is
connected largely with the increasing concern of Government with such matters as
health, education and housing. But up to i95°> and particularly in the decade
1940—50, there was also an increase in the State’s direct participation in productive
economic activities, although since 1951 this increase has been checked and in two
instances—steel and road transport—steps have been taken to return ownership to
private enterprise. State participation is effected mainly through special statutory
bodies set up to deal with a particular activity. Such bodies, though not part of a
Government Department, are under a considerable but varying degree of public
control (see p. 124). The most important of these statutory bodies have been the
public corporations which operate major industries and services in the public
interest.
The public corporation in its twentieth-century form is, generally speaking, a
public body having a clearly defined and specific task. Its board of directors and its
staff are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are
not civil servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, they are free from full and continuous ministerial control.
Certain of the corporations are self-supporting. Others receive Exchequer grants to
help them in carrying out the duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war a number of public corporations were established,
designed to reorganize and to operate for the public benefit some service that
required co-ordination or public assistance and control. Their constitutions had no
standard pattern and even their governing bodies differed in the method of appoint¬
ment and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war the Nationalization Acts set up public
corporations to run certain major industries and services including coalmining,
inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply and civil air trans¬
port. These post-war corporations are less varied in the composition of their
governing bodies, which are appointed by the responsible Minister, who has full
powers of dismissal.
An analysis made privately in 1950 by a government statistician found that the
number of persons employed in the public sector of the economy as a whole
increased by 50 per cent between 1945 and i950» 80 thst by the middle of i95°>
per cent of the total number of persons in civil employment were in the public
sector and 77! per cent in the private sector. In manufacturing and building, private
enterprise still accounts for the major part of activity, employing, in 1950, 96 per
cent of the persons engaged in these industries. Also in terms of employment, only
about 30 per cent of the public utilities—gas, electricity, water and transport was
the concern of private enterprise. In mid-1954 the position was still approximately
the same.

Mining and Quarrying
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
The coalmining industry of Great Britain is operated as a single co-ordinated
enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board (see p. 152), a public
corporation appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power. The mining of iron ore
is in the hands of private companies, many of which, though retaining their indivi¬
dual names and managements, were brought under public ownership by the Iron
and Steel Act of i949- Under the Iron and Steel Act of 1953 (see p. 169) the
companies are in process of being returned to private ownership. Many of these
companies, in addition to extracting ore, are engaged in at least some of the manu¬
facturing processes of iron and steel production.
Other mining and quarrying (e.g., sand, gravel, chalk, limestone, salt, tin, slate,
oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private enterprises, usually owned and
operated by limited liability companies.
Manufacturing
Most manufacturing is still in the hands of private enterprises. Some exceptions
are locomotives and rolling-stock for use on British Railways, mostly built in work¬
shops owned and operated by the British Transport Commission (see p. 195), a
public corporation appointed by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation;
a considerable quantity of arms and military equipment made in Royal Ord¬
nance factories and other factories operated by the Ministry of Supply, and
some fighting ships built in naval dockyards operated by the Admiralty. Some
printing and bookbinding is undertaken by staffs of the Stationery Office, while the
repair, and to a limited extent the construction, of Post Office equipment is carried
on in factories run by the Post Office. The companies primarily concerned with
manufactures of iron and steel which were owned by the Iron and Steel Corporation,
and subject to its policy direction, are being returned to private ownership under
the Iron and Steel Act of 1953.
A survey of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more than
10 persons was made by the Ministry of Labour and National Service in May 1952;
the results of the survey are shown in Table 15.
Over a quarter of all employees in manufacturing industries are in establishments
employing from 100 to 500 persons. A high proportion of the biggest establishments
are in the heavy industries, while the average size of establishments in industries
making consumer goods is smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole.
Comparisons with results obtained in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that
there is a slow but significant trend towards an increase in the average size of
manufacturing establishments: in May 1952 establishments with 1,000 or more
employees were found to employ 2,224,000 persons, more than twice as many as in
1935-
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manufactur¬
ing firms, as a single firm may own several establishments. There are no general
surveys of the size of manufacturing firms comparable to the survey of establish¬
ments. It is known, however, that in a few industries a small number of big com¬
panies are responsible for most of the total production. Shares in these companies
are usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is unusual for a few
large holders to have a controlling interest.
The way in which the work of production is divided within and between different
firms varies from industry to industry. In the cotton industry, for example, it is usual
for different firms to undertake the various main processes of production (spinning,
weaving, finishing), while in the woollen section of the wool textile industry all

121
these processes are commonly undertaken within the same firm. Some of the lead¬
ing establishments in the vehicles group of industries are primarily engaged on the
assembly of parts, many of which have been built for them under contract by
specialist firms.
Building and Civil Engineering
In building and civil engineering most of the work is undertaken by private
firms. Since the end of the second world war, most new houses have been built by
firms under contract to local authorities, but an increasing number are now being
built by private enterprise, mainly for owner-occupiers but some for sale. Some
xo per cent of local authorities employ labour direct for the construction of new
houses, while over 80 per cent use their own labour for repair and maintenance.
(For the numbers of houses built since 1945 see p. 322.)
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and civil
engineering work and those undertaking highly specialized work, many of whom
operate outside as well as inside the building industry. Building is an industry of
small firms, nearly a third of building operatives work in firms employing from 20
to 99 persons, while about 16 per cent work in firms employing fewer than six
persons or are self-employed.
Industrial Association
From the middle of the nineteenth century private industrial undertakings have
increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different purposes.
Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with Government, and representation of their members’ point of view.
2. The regulation of trading practices. Where this involves restrictions on
competition, the Monopolies Commission (see pp. 124-5) can be asked by the
Board of Trade to investigate the effect of such restrictions on the public
interest.
3. Negotiation with trade unions about wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover with varying complete¬
ness almost the whole of British industry but there are wide sectors of industry
where there is no collective agreement to regulate trading practice. Associations
which deal with labour matters generally consist of firms engaged in the same type
of manufacturing process. Organizations mainly concerned with representations to
Government, provision of common services or the regulation of prices are built up
round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector concerned
wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake all
required functions.
There are about 270 national federations and probably about 1,600 other
employers’ organizations (mostly regional or local, and members or branches of the
national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of
work. Most of the national federations are in turn affiliated to the British Employers'
Confederation, the national body representing employers on labour questions affect¬
ing industry generally (see p. 236).
No comparable statistics exist for associations concerned with the provision of
common services, etc., or the regulation of trade and prices. There are, however,
about 300 national organizations which are affiliated to the Federation of British
Industries (FBI), the national body recognized as the spokesman for British
122
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industry on economic, commercial and production (as opposed to labour) ques¬
tions. The FBI has offices in the main industrial centres in the United Kingdom
and is very widely represented abroad.
A number of the organizations affiliated to the FBI also deal with labour matters
and are affiliated to the British Employers’ Confederation. The two organizations
work closely together on matters of common interest.
Other important national associations of employers are the National Union of
Manufacturers (NUM) and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. The
members of NUM are over 5,000 manufacturing firms, mainly small or medium
sized, and some 70 trade associations are affiliated to it. Like the FBI it has regional
branches. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce is the central
organization to which local Chambers of Commerce are affiliated. There are about
100 of these local Chambers. They are open to all kinds of producers and traders
and exist for promoting the interests of local industry and commerce. These last
three national organizations, all being concerned with industrial and trading matters,
often collaborate in the consideration of particular questions.
Relations with Government
As a general rule each industry has a particular Government Department as its
‘Production Department’, which is its point of contact with the Government. The
main Production Departments and the industries and services in which they are
interested are:
Board of Trade . . . . All industries and materials not the responsibility
of another Department, among the most impor¬
tant being textiles (including clothing), paper and
film industries, and a large part of the chemical

Ministry of Housing and
Local Government . . House-building.
Ministry of Health . . Medical and surgical goods.
The Treasury and the Ministry of Labour and National Service, though prominent
in economic matters, have no production authority duties.
During and after the second world war many operations of industry and com¬
merce were subject to Government control. Most of these controls have been
relaxed, but some remain. Thus the consent of the Treasury is required for the
issue of large amounts of fresh capital or for the purchase of foreign currency; and
that of the Board of Trade for the import or export of certain goods. The Board of
INDUSTRY
123
Trade has certain powers to influence the location of industry (see p. 117), and the
Ministry of Housing and Local Government, acting through local planning
authorities, also has powers to control the use of land (see pp. 326—32).
In the post-war period an effective control was that over the allocation, distribu¬
tion and use of raw materials. The degree of control was governed to a large extent
by the supply situation—an important factor in which is the availability of foreign
exchange—and varied from time to time. Thus, controls removed in the immediate
post-war years had to be reimposed in 1951 when the rearmament programmes of
the free world, superimposed on rising civilian demands, caused shortages of many
key raw materials, including zinc, lead, copper, nickel and steel. Since then, an
improving supply position has made it possible to relax all these controls.
All Departments which are production authorities, and some others, have a
responsibility for promoting increased productivity and efficiency in industry.
Production authorities, for example, encourage the establishment within each
industry and within individual undertakings of joint councils and committees in
which representatives of employers and of workers discuss together improvements
in methods and technique. They also work with and through various statutory and
voluntary bodies concerned with the same ends and make grants to them in
appropriate cases. Such bodies include employers’ associations (see p. 236) and
trade unions (see p. 236), the British Productivity Council (see p. 127), a voluntary
body representing employers and trade unions; the various management and pro¬
fessional associations including the British Institute of Management, the Council
of Industrial Design (see p. 359), and the Development Councils which may be set
up under the provisions of the Industrial Organization and Development Act,
1947, by Departments responsible for the industry concerned. The purpose of the
Councils is to provide firms in an industry with those services (research, design,
statistics, personnel training, etc.) which individual firms cannot afford out
of their resources. There are at present development councils for the cotton in¬
dustry {The Cotton Board), and for the furniture industry. The Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 344) encourages and sometimes finances
industrial research and also itself conducts research useful to industry. The na¬
tional standards organization is the British Standards Institution, a voluntary
non-profit-making body, incorporated by Royal Charter. It is governed by a
General Council consisting of representatives of the main organizations of em¬
ployers and workpeople, the professional institutions and the larger Government
Departments, and it receives a Government grant.
Technical advice is available for those firms which ask for it through such services
as the National Agricultural Advisory Service of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries, and the Personnel Management Advisory Service of the Ministry of
Labour and National Service.
To ensure that industry is fully aware of Government policy and that policy is
framed with a full knowledge of industry’s needs and difficulties, a number of con¬
sultative bodies have been set up representing Government, employers’ associations
and trade unions. Among the more important of these are the National Production
Advisory Council on Industry (NPACI) and the National Joint Advisory Council
(NJAC). The NJAC consists of representatives of private employers, the boards of
nationalized industries and trade unionists under the chairmanship of the Minister
of Labour and National Service, and is concerned with matters affecting the rela¬
tions between employers and workers (see p. 240). The NPACI, which covers the
wider problems of industrial production, is under the chairmanship of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and includes representatives of certain Government
Departments as well as of employers and workers.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
124
These consultative bodies approach the study of problems from a broad national
point of view. There are in addition consultative bodies concerned with the special
problems of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and of the English regions. The
most important of these are the Regional Boards for Industry whose main functions
are to keep the Government informed on industrial conditions in the nine English
regions and in Wales and Scotland, and to provide a link between central Govern¬
ment and local industry.
Government and Public Corporations
The extent to which the responsible Minister has power over the working of the
Boards set up to run those industries which have been nationalized varies from
industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them. First the
Minister appoints the chairman and members of each Board, and secondly he has
power to give general directions as to how the industry should be run, but does not
interfere in day-to-day management. It is usually also laid down that the Board
shall give to the Minister any information, statistics, financial accounts, and so forth,
which he may require.
The most usual financial arrangement is that the Board is required to conduct its
business so that receipts at least balance outgoings over a period of years. The excep¬
tion to this rule is Civil Aviation; the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation
(subject to Treasury approval) has power to make grants to the two Airways
Corporations up to specified limits in the first few years of their existence. The
responsible Minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to say
what shall be done with any surplus should the Boards make a profit. The Boards
can also borrow money up to certain limits, but require the consent of the respon¬
sible Minister and the Treasury each time.
The Minister responsible for each nationalized industry must take steps
to see that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually
done by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider com¬
plaints and suggestions made to them and advise the Board or the Minister on the
changes they think desirable. It is recognized that these arrangements are still to a
great extent experimental.
In most other respects the nationalized industries have the same relations with
the Department responsible for them as do the private industries; they look to them
for sponsorship and advice on productivity, and are subject to the same controls.
The arrangements necessary to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the
nationalized industries is informed and effective have been examined by a Select
Committee of the House of Commons which was appointed in November 1952 and
reported in July 1953.
On 13th July 1954 the Lord Privy Seal announced in the House of Commons
that the Government was taking action on the basis of this report (though some of
the specific recommendations were modified). During the next session it was intended
to introduce an ad hoc motion for the appointment of a Select Committee on the
Nationalized Industries. The task of this committee, which would consist of not
more than 14 members of the House of Commons, would be to examine the
reports and accounts of the nationalized industries, to obtain further information
about their current policies and practices, and to report from time to time, publish¬
ing its evidence, unless this was contrary to the public interest.
Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
Under the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act,
1948, an independent Commission called the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices
INDUSTRY
125
Commission was established to investigate and report on matters referred to it by
the Board of Trade, which also appoints the members of the Commission. Broadly
speaking, a reference may be made where it appears that at least one-third of the
supply, processing or exports of any commodity is in the hands of a single firm or
is subject to arrangements which in any way restrict competition. Where the
Commission finds that these conditions do prevail and are contrary to the public
interest, Production Departments are empowered by the Act to take suitable
remedial action. The Board of Prade is required to publish an annual report on
the working of the Act, including a list of the suggestions and requests made for
reference of matters to the Commission.
Up to July 1954 the Commission had been given references relating to the
following matters. dental goods, cast iron rainwater goods, electric lamps, insulated
electric wires and cables, matches and match-making machinery, insulin, semi¬
manufactures of copper and copper-based alloys, printing of woven fabrics,
imported hardwood and softwood timber and plywood, certain electrical and allied
machinery and plant, pneumatic tyres, buildings in the Greater London area, hard
fibre cordage, linoleum, sand and gravel in central Scotland for building or civil
engineering purposes, certain industrial and medical gases, standard metal windows
and doors, and some types of rubber footwear. Reports had been published on
eight of these matters.
In December 1952 the Commission began an investigation into the general effect
on the public interest of certain widely prevalent practices; broadly speaking, their
inquiry covers arrangements between a number of traders to discriminate in favour
of, or against, a defined class of customer.
In October 1953 a Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission Act was
passed, the purpose of which was to strengthen the Monopolies Commission and
enable it to deal at any one time with a greater number of references. This amending
Act provides amongst other things that the Commission’s work may be divided
among groups of not more than five members selected by the chairman.
Production
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacture, and building and
civil engineering) in 1950 averaged nearly a third above 1946, when it was at about
the pre-war level. The rate of increase slackened off in 1951, when it was about
3 per cent compared with annual increases of about 7 per cent in the three previous
years. This slackening was due in part to the effect of steel shortage on metal goods
production and in part to a fall in demand for textiles and clothing. In 1952 produc¬
tion was 3 per cent less than in 1951. The effects of steel shortage were still being
felt, particularly in the first half of the year, but more important was the fall in
demand which took place at home and overseas, and affected mainly the consumer-
goods industries, particularly textiles and clothing. Production and employment fell
sharply after the first quarter of 1952 but began to recover in the last quarter and
was higher in the third and fourth quarters of 1953 than in the corresponding
quarters of either 1952 or 1951. At the end of 1953, industrial production was
6 per cent above the level of 1951, and there have been further gains in 1954.
Over the post-war period as a whole the greatest increases in production have
been in the engineering, shipbuilding and electrical goods group, the vehicles group
and the chemicals group, with increases since 1946 of approximately 60 per cent,
60 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.
In 1946 and 1947 production increased at about the same rate as the civilian
labour force, which grew rapidly as men returned from the armed forces. From
1947 the increase in the numbers employed slowed, while production continued
126
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES

127
rapidly to expand: this rise in productivity was about 3 per cent a year up to 1951.
Since 1952 demand has increasingly become the main determinant of the level of
output; in other words, the world sellers’ market has given way to a buyers’ market.
In 1952, while industrial production fell by 3 per cent, employment fell by less
than 1 per cent, and the lower levels of demand and output were reflected in a
reduction in hours worked and lower output per man. In 1953, when demand
recovered, employment rose by much less than production—1 per cent against
6 per cent—and output per man recovered.
The need to increase productivity has been a constant concern of Government
and industry. One important step was the formation in 1948 of the Anglo-American
Productivity Council, the main purpose of which was to promote productivity in
Britain through the exchange of ideas between various British industries and the
corresponding industries in the United States. ‘Productivity teams’ made up of
representatives of management, technical and workshop levels from British
industries were sent to the United States for study and, on their return, their
findings were made public.
When this Council was wound up after four years’ work, its task of helping to
promote higher productivity in Britain was continued by the British Productivity
Council, formally established in London in November 1952. This is an independent
body drawing its funds mainly from the organizations represented on it: the British
Employers’ Confederation, the Federation of British Industries, the Trades Union
Congress, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the National Union
of Manufacturers and the nationalized industries. Its programme of action includes
the formation of Local Productivity Committees and the exchange of visits between
teams from different industrial firms for the purpose of studying common problems.
Capital Development
In recent years gross fixed capital formation has accounted for about one-seventh
of gross national expenditure. Table 16 shows the breakdown by groups of
industries since 1948 and Table 17 shows capital formation in manufacturing
industries between 1948 and 1952. In 1952 industrial investment (excluding fuel
and power) was lower than in 1951. It was affected by the steel shortage, by
physical restrictions imposed on investment in order to free resources for export
and defence, and by a reduction in demand for investment which no doubt to
some extent reflected the effects of the new monetary and fiscal restraints. An
important aim of the 1953 Budget proposals was to encourage the re-equipment
and modernization of productive industry, the expansion of capacity in lines com¬
manding a ready oversea sale, and the development of new lines and techniques.
Easier licensing procedure was also announced for new factories and extensions.
In terms of 1952 prices, investment in 1953 was about £215 million greater than
in 1952. Over half the increase was attributable to housing. Other increases were
registered by mining, shipping, electricity, gas and water, rail transport and tele¬
phone services. Fixed investment by manufacturing industries was about the same
in both years in terms of current prices. The policy of encouraging industrial invest¬
ment—particularly in manufacturing industries—was continued in the 1954 Budget
proposals, of which a main feature was a system of investment allowances to give
new encouragement to industry to put money into productive investment.
Average capital expenditure per employee1 in 1950 was £62 for manufacturing
industry as a whole. The industrial sectors with the highest rates of fixed capital

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is an industrialized country relying on imports for half its
food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and most important industries.
It provides employment for about a million people and uses some 48 million of the
60 million acres of land.
LAND AND CLIMATE
The land in general is highly fertile and with efficient farming this results
in a yield per acre of grain crops among the highest in the world. In 1953, for
example, previous record yields for these and other crops in England and Wales
were again broken. Yields per acre were (in cwts.): wheat 24; barley 22-6; oats
21-2; rye 19-6; (in tons) potatoes 8-7; sugar beet 13-1. Agriculture in the United
Kingdom is less subject to serious dislocation caused by extreme climatic condi¬
tions than it is in some other countries; crops and livestock, for example, are seldom
subjected to the dangers of drought, or floods, or severe cold. Nevertheless when
abnormal climatic conditions do occur (e.g., during the severe winter of 1946-47)
they tend to assume great importance because they affect the fulfilment of definite
agricultural programmes.
Types of Farming
There are more than 535,000 farms in the United Kingdom: 377,000 in England
and Wales; 74,000 in Scotland; and 84,000 in Northern Ireland. About three-
fifths of the total are under 50 acres in size.
In England and Wales out of a total of 29-7 million acres of agricultural land,
24-5 million acres are under crops and grass.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
130
Types of farming vary widely with difference of soil and climate. In general
the eastern half of England is predominantly arable and the western half of England,
together with Wales, are predominantly dairying. Pasture types of farming account
for 37 per cent of agricultural land, arable types for 22 per cent and intermediate
types for 29 per cent; the remainder being unclassifiable or of little agricultural
value. In many places land of several types is found intermingled within a small
area. Market-gardens are usually found near towns. Fattening of animals for food
is widespread but is carried on particularly in the Home counties, Midlands and
Eastern counties, and stock-rearing is prevalent in Wales and in the North of
England.
In Scotland out of a total of over 15 million acres of agricultural land, 4^ million
acres are under crops and grass, the rest being rough hill grazings (about 11 million
acres) or land only able to support deer and game. The chief crop is oats (887,930
acres in 1953); next come root crops for stock-feeding; potatoes, especially seed
potatoes, and barley are also important crops. The wheat area is small. In the south¬
west dairying is the chief branch of the industry, while cropping and fattening
cattle are practised mainly in the east. The rearing of stock (especially sheep) is of
importance in the hill areas.
In Northern Ireland the total of 2-97 million acres of agricultural land in 1953
included 2*28 million acres under crops and pasture. The land is intensively farmed,
the chief crops being potatoes, oats, flax, and ryegrass for seed. An average of about
80 per cent of Northern Ireland’s agricultural income is derived from livestock and
livestock products. The total quantity of milk sold off farms during 1953 was
about 95 million gallons.
Horticulture accounts for one-sixth of the value of the agricultural output of the
United Kingdom. The war-time need for self-sufficiency and the shortage of other
foods led to a great increase in the acreage under vegetables, but return to a more
normal diet and the reopening of oversea sources of supply have brought about a
reduction of the area, which is now not much greater than before the war. The
acreage under fruit remains at about the pre-war level, but the crops produced
on that area have been approximately doubled.
Although the commoner vegetables are grown to some extent all over the country,
there is a tendency for certain crops to predominate in specialized areas, e.g.,
broccoli in Cornwall and Kent, carrots and rhubarb in Yorkshire, asparagus and
plums in Worcestershire, cherries in Kent, apples in Kent and Hereford, onions in
the Fen district, strawberries in Hampshire and tomatoes under glass in the Lea
Valley. Early vegetables are supplied from the Channel Islands.
During the war the area devoted to flowers was drastically reduced by official
controls. It has taken the nursery industry some time to recover from the setback but
the acreage is now about the same as before the war. Early spring flowers are
grown in the Scilly Isles.
Changes since 1870
In the middle of the nineteenth century Britain was largely self-sufficient in
agricultural production. Then wool, grain and later meat—all produced cheaply
from virgin lands—were increasingly imported, and the farming industry had to
undergo a major alteration and concentrate much more on milk, eggs, pigs and
horticultural produce. Changes in production and types of farming in successive
attempts to meet changes of fortune resulted in a continuous trend throughout
the period away from an agricultural industry based mainly on grain to one based
more on livestock and livestock products, and, among crops, an increasing emphasis
on vegetables.
INDUSTRY
131
Moreover the meat, dairy and poultry industries were becoming increasingly
dependent on imported feedingstuffs. The arable area in Britain declined con¬
tinuously from 1872 until 1939, except during the first world war. The outbreak
of the second world war was followed by an immediate reversal of farming policy,
for shortage of shipping space for imports demanded a greatly increased home
production of crops for direct human consumption such as wheat and potatoes,
largely at the expense of livestock and livestock products other than milk. The
post-war world food shortage and Britain’s balance of payments problems made it
necessary for Britain to maintain increased grain production, but since 1947 an
expansion of output of livestock, livestock products and animal feedingstuffs has
been encouraged concurrently with the maintenance of a high level of production
of grain and other crops.
Recent trends in agricultural policy have resulted in greater emphasis on stock¬
rearing for meat and less stress on further increases in milk production.
The use of agricultural land for the various crops and the numbers of livestock
on farms in the United Kingdom since 1924 are shown in Tables 18 and 19.

THE GROWTH OF POLICY
The severe agricultural depression which followed the fall in the general price
level after 1920 resulted in 1931 in the beginning of a programme of financial
assistance to agriculture, including tariffs, subsidies and quotas, which had a
stabilizing effect on the prices of grain, cattle and milk, developed the sugar beet
industry and encouraged cultivation of sub-marginal land (land which it is
not profitable to cultivate).
Commodity commissions were set up for wheat, sugar, livestock and bacon.
In addition, to enable the home producer to regulate the marketing of his produce,
the Agricultural Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1933 provided for the establishment
of commodity marketing boards in Great Britain, and by September 1939 there
were eight such boards concerned with the marketing of four products—potatoes,
hops, bacon pigs (two boards), and milk (four boards).
The Agricultural Marketing Boards are producers’ organizations established
under the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Acts, 1931, 1933 and 1949.
They have compulsory powers to regulate the marketing of particular agricultural
products by producers.
The schemes under which the various Boards are constituted and operate
must be approved by Parliament and confirmed by a poll of the producers con¬
cerned. A Board must normally consist of from 8 to 24 members; not fewer than
two and not more than one-fifth of the total number must be appointed by the
Minister.
During the war and the post-war years agriculture was closely controlled by
the State and the functions of marketing boards, commodity commissions and
similar bodies were largely suspended. Farmers’ prices were fixed by the State
for the principal agricultural products, the majority of which were purchased by
the State. This was coupled with close State control of food imports, many of
which were bought on Government account, the stabilization of food prices by
means of subsidies, and a rigid system of food rationing for most of the principal
food products. In addition the State exercised a close supervision over the level and
efficiency of agricultural production.
In 1947 the Agriculture Act was passed, which provided the main basis of post¬
war agricultural policy in England and Wales and the controls to implement it.
Similar Acts for Scotland and Northern Ireland were passed in 1948 and 1949
INDUSTRY
133
respectively. The principles of the 1947 Act were that the Government would
provide the industry with a system of guarantees which would ensure ‘a stable and
efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation’s food as
in the national interest it is desired to produce’. In return for this, the Act gave the
Government power to insist on a minimum level of efficiency. Farmers and land-
owners are respectively required to maintain a reasonable standard of husbandry
and estate management. If they do not do so, the Agricultural Ministers are able to
issue directions, and in the last resort to require a change of occupation or owner¬
ship (see p. 138). The implementation of these Acts is the responsibility respectively
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (see p. 39), the Department of
Agriculture for Scotland (see p. 53) and the Ministry of Agriculture in Northern
Ireland (often known collectively as the Agricultural Departments).
The Acts provide for the holding of an Annual Review of the economic condition
and prospects of the agricultural industry. This is conducted by the Agricultural
Departments with the farmers representatives, fti the light of the review, price
guarantees are determined for livestock and livestock products for the next year
and for crops to be harvested in the year following that in which the review is
held. The products concerned are: wheat, barley, oats, rye, potatoes, sugar beet,
fatstock, milk and eggs; wool was added in 1950. Minimum prices for livestock and
their products are also fixed for two to four years ahead. Provision is also made for
special reviews to be held at any time if the Ministers consider that there has been
a sudden substantial change in costs or in other conditions. There are powers to
relate guaranteed prices to the levels of output of particular products. These were
used for the first time in 1954 for milk.
Guarantees after Decontrol
As world supplies of food and Britain’s own trading position have improved in
the last few years, the Government has gradually restored both the import of food
and all domestic trading in food to private business. All consumer rationing of
food ended in Britain on 3rd July 1954. But the basic policy of the Agriculture
Act, 1947, including guarantees to farmers, remained. In the words of the White
Paper (Cmd. 8989) of November 1953:
‘Direct Government purchase of home-produced food can no longer be the
sole or main instrument for implementing the Government’s guarantees to
farmers. But the Government firmly adheres to the principles of the Agriculture
Act, 1947, and fully accepts its obligation to make alternative arrangements to
secure a stable and efficient agriculture.’
The White Paper stated that no single method could be devised for meeting all
problems and that each commodity had to be considered separately. In some cases
temporary methods then in force which combined market freedom with guarantees
would be maintained. In others the Government would make full use of producers’
marketing boards. Additional powers to control such boards and to widen their
functions to include the supply of requisites and a wider range of services to
producers had been conferred on Ministers by the Agricultural Marketing Act,
I949- Thus, wool continued to be marketed through the Wool Marketing Board,
and marketing powers were restored to the Milk Marketing Boards on 1st April
I954. although for as long as there remains an element of consumer subsidy the
Government will continue to be responsible for approving prices and distributive
margins for milk. An interim scheme for eggs, whereby a National Egg Marketing
Organization was set up to advise the Minister of Food on orderly marketing
arrangements after decontrol on 26th March 1953, is expected to give way to more
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
134
permanent machinery in the form of a marketing board. Steps are being taken to
restore the Potato Marketing Board. Since 1st July 1954, when Government
purchase of home produced fatstock ended, farmers have been able to sell their
fatstock by auction at approved fatstock markets by private treaty and by grade
and deadweight.
Consumers’ Committees to represent the consumers’ interests in regard to the
operation of marketing schemes were reconstituted in December 1953. They had
been set up in 1931 and disbanded in 1939.
The guarantees fixed at the 1954 Annual Review and described in a further
White Paper (Cmd. 9104) are being given in four different ways:
(1) Fixed guarantee prices, the general form of guarantee before the return to
free markets, continue to apply to milk, wool, potatoes and sugar beet. In
the case of milk, however, the guaranteed price is limited to a standard
quantity. If total sales, off farms exceed this, the effective level of the
guaranteed price per gallon is reduced.
(2) Minimum or support prices, below which the Government pays the differ¬
ence on sales taking place, apply to eggs and are designed to protect the
farmer from low prices resulting from periodic gluts. Potatoes from the
1955 harvest will be dealt with in a similar way.
(3) Deficiency payments schemes, under which the Government establishes
a standard price and pays each producer the deficiency (if any) between
this price and the average realized market price multiplied by the volume
of his sales, apply to wheat, rye, barley and oats, but for barley and oats
the price deficiency is converted into a payment per acre. The method also
applies to fat cattle, fat sheep, fat lambs and pigs. The guarantee is
collective; it safeguards the incomes of producers as a whole and the
individual producer may get more or less than the standard price. Other¬
wise standard prices are similar in principle to minimum prices, except
that they have been fixed high enough to give a more extensive type of
protection.
(4) Guaranteed individual prices, which guarantee a minimum price for each
individual transaction additional to the collective guarantee, are applicable
to fatstock (except fat cows).
In explaining that the effect of the changes made at the 1954 Review could not
be forecast precisely, since in a freer economy farmers’ receipts would depend less
on fixed prices and more on sales in a competitive market supplemented when
necessary by guarantees, the White Paper stated that while net agricultural income
might be somewhat lower than at present (the figure for 1953-54 was given as
£321 million) the Government was satisfied that the guarantees assured the
industry a satisfactory level of income in accordance with the 1947 Act. If the
industry were to maintain its net income it would have to reduce costs further and
sell its produce competitively and in relation to world food prices, and so continue
to prosper with less assistance from the Exchequer.
The cost of these guarantees to the agricultural industry is included in the
general subsidies on certain basic foods, whether home produced or imported.
Total subsidies on food (home produced and imported combined) for 1953-54
amounted to £334 million. Table 20 shows how this sum was distributed. The
Financial Statement for 1954-55 provided for agricultural and food subsidies
amounting to £337'3 million in 1954-55.

The above figures do not include certain direct agricultural subsidies, such as

Guernsey, Friesian and Ayrshire breeds) which are suitable for rearing for beef
production; grants towards the cost of field drainage, ditching schemes and farm
water supplies; grants for the improvement of stock-rearing land in hill and upland
districts, for increasing food or fodder production on poor or difficult land;
subsidies for livestock improvement and for the supply of fertilizers and agri¬
cultural lime.
THE EXECUTION OF POLICY
Agricultural policy is carried out in England and Wales under the Minister of
Agriculture through County Agricultural Executive Committees (CAECs) set up
under the Agriculture Act, 1947, with the duty of promoting agricultural develop¬
ment and efficiency.
County Agricultural Executive Committees
Each committee consists of twelve members. Five are appointed directly by the
Minister, and seven from panels nominated by the interests concerned, three
being farmers, two landowners and two workers. One of those directly appointed
is a member of the county council; the others are persons with special qualifications
K
i36 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
or with experience of local agriculture. The committees are represented in areas
within the county by District Committees. The system of voluntary part-time
liaison officers, to interpret Government policy to the CAECs, was revived in
1952. The arrangements differ in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, agri¬
cultural policy is carried out under the Secretary of State for Scotland through
the Department of Agriculture by 11 Area Agricultural Executive Committees.
In Northern Ireland, an Agricultural Executive Officer working directly under
the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for carrying out the
Government’s agricultural policy in each county.
The Agricultural Land Commission
The Agricultural Land Commission was set up under the Agriculture Act, 1947.
Its functions are to manage and farm lands vested in the Minister of Agriculture
and Fisheries, or land for which he has become responsible; and to advise and
assist the Minister in matters relating to the management of agricultural land.
The Commission also advises the Minister on the exercise of his powers of com¬
pulsory purchase under the 1947 Act, to ensure the full and efficient use of agri¬
cultural land. The Commission manages about 200,000 acres. Nearly half of this
is agricultural land intermixed with other lands used by the Forestry Commission.
The remainder is mostly land acquired by the Minister under the Act on the
grounds of ensuring its full and efficient use for agriculture.
In Scotland, the management of lands vested in the Secretary of State and the
duty of advising him on management matters are carried out by the Department of
Agriculture.
The Agricultural Land Service
In 1943 Rural Land Utilization Officers were appointed to advise planning
authorities on the agricultural implications of development plans in England and
Wales. This work, as well as that of the pre-war Land Commissioner Service, has
now been taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture’s Agricultural Land Service,
formed in 1948, which operates in eight provinces. The main duties of this
service are as follows: (1) to act as agent for the Agricultural Land Commission,
giving technical advice on the acquisition and management of agricultural land,
(2) to give technical advice on measures to ensure good estate management, on
the agricultural aspects of planning and the release of agricultural land for other
development, including afforestation, on schemes under the Hill Farming and
Livestock Rearing Acts and the Marginal Production Schemes, on the provision
and management of smallholdings by smallholdings authorities, and on the pro¬
vision of allotments by local authorities.
In Scotland similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department of
Agriculture.
PRODUCTION
Before the second world war, Britain produced about 31 per cent of its food
supplies (in terms of calories for human consumption). By 1953 this had risen to
nearly 50 per cent. The comparable figures in terms of values are 36 per cent pre¬
war and about 51 percent in 1952-53. Imports of food and feedingstuffs accoun¬
ted for 45 per cent by value of total imports pre-war and about 40 per cent in
In 1947 plans were made to secure an increase in the volume of annual agricultural
net output to about 50 per cent above the pre-war level by 1952. rl his objective was

in fact achieved, the official index number (pre-war average = 100) being 152 for
1952 53 {Cmd. 9104). A further objective to raise this to at least 160 by 1956 was
announced in 1952 {Cmd. 8556) and confirmed in 1954 {Cmd. 9104). The index
number for 1953-54 « provisionally given as 156. Table 21 shows the trend in

PROMOTION OF EFFICIENCY
Besides providing financial stability through guarantees to farmers (see pp. 133-4),
the State promotes efficiency by means of various facilities, safeguards, schemes
and services.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Loan Facilities
In England and Wales long-term finance for agricultural properties is provided
by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, formed under the provisions of the
Agriculture Credits Acts, 1928 and 1932. The Corporation’s funds are derived
mainly from the proceeds of various issues of debenture stocks which are sub¬
scribed by the public and are repaid by the operation of sinking funds. The
Corporation may also raise money in the form of interest-free loans from the
Government up to a total of £2'5 million under the Agricultural Credits Act, 1928,
and the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1944. In Scotland loans on
favourable terms for agricultural purposes on the security of agricultural land in
Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Limited,
a limited company set up in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural
Credits (Scotland) Act, 1929. The Corporation receives an annual grant from the
Treasury to cover loss of earnings arising from a reduction of the lending rate in
1944.
Security of Tenure
Returns made in 1950 for the purpose of the United Nations Food and Agri¬
culture Organization’s World Census, showed that about 36 per cent of holdings
in England and Wales were wholly owned by the occupier; 49 per cent wholly
rented; and 15 per cent part-owned and part-rented. The proportion of owner-
occupiers is substantially higher in the case of holdings of under 5 acres but does
not vary appreciably from size group to size group in the case of larger holdings.
There are no farm landlords in Northern Ireland, where, under various Land Acts
passed between 1870 and 1925, every farmer is either the owner, or is in process of
becoming the owner, of his holding.
In England and Wales the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, required at least
12 months’ notice to be given to quit an agricultural holding and gave the tenant
a right to compensation for disturbance on leaving his holding; a tenant had no
statutory right of contesting the notice to quit. The Agricultural Holdings Act,
1948, gave the tenant the right in normal circumstances to have the matter referred
to the County Agricultural Executive Committee (acting for the Minister), either
tenant or landlord could then appeal against the committee’s decision to an
Agricultural Land Tribunal (see below). The Scottish Act of 1949 applies similar
provisions to Scotland, with a right of appeal to the Scottish Land Court.
Under the Agriculture Act, 1947, the Minister of Agriculture has the power to
place under supervision an owner or occupier considered guilty of bad estate
management or bad husbandry. This power he has delegated to the County
Agricultural Executive Committees. If the owner or occupier fails to show satis¬
factory improvement in his standard of management or of husbandry after 12
months under supervision, or earlier if he has failed to comply with a direction, he
may be dispossessed. Dispossession of an owner means compulsory purchase.
Dispossession of an occupier merely means that his occupation is terminated and
the new occupier has to be approved by the Committee. An owner or occupier may
appeal to an Agricultural Land Tribunal against a proposal that he should be
dispossessed.
Agricultural Land Tribunals
Agricultural Land Tribunals, which are independent bodies each consisting
of a chairman, appointed by the Lord Chancellor (usually for three years), and two
members representing landowners and farmers appointed by the chairman from
INDUSTRY
139
panels drawn up by the Lord Chancellor after consulting representative bodies,
were originally set up in England and Wales in 1948 under the Agriculture Act,
1947. Their task is to hear and to decide cases in which decisions and proposals
(generally notices to quit or proposals to dispossess) of the Minister of Agriculture,
or of the County Agricultural Executive Committees acting on his behalf, are
referred to them at the request of one of the parties concerned. Under new
regulations made in 1954 a Tribunal may, at the request of any interested party
or at the direction of the Court, refer questions of law to the High Court of Justice.
Smallholdings and Allotments
There are about one million allotments in the United Kingdom. Most of these
are allotment gardens1 and are provided by local authorities, who have certain
powers and duties under the Allotments Acts.
There are also some 20,000 smallholdings provided by county councils and
county borough councils in England and Wales and by the Minister of Agriculture
and Fisheries. Of these some 11,000 are capable of providing a full-time occupation
for the tenant. These smallholdings are let only to people with practical experience
in agriculture, preferably agricultural workers, with the object of affording them
an opportunity to become farmers on their own account. Loans may be made to the
tenants of up to 75 Per cent of the working capital they require.
Of the smallholdings provided by the Minister of Agriculture approximately
1,000 situated on 18 different estates are managed on the Minister’s behalf by the
Land Settlement Association Limited, which was originally formed in 1935 to
develop smallholdings for unemployed men from industrial areas. The Association
provides centrally on each estate various services for the tenant’s use. These
services include the supply of agricultural stores and requisites, the operation of
a machinery pool, and the packing and marketing of produce.
The Welsh Land Settlement Society, which was also formed to assist in the
settlement on the land of unemployed industrial workers, created a number of
profit-sharing farms, which still operate.
In Scotland the Department of Agriculture provided plots of up to one acre
for the unemployed. In 1937 there were over 2,000 plot-holders, but there has been
a gradual closing down of the schemes since the end of the war and the number
of plot-holders had fallen to 403 at the end of 1953.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central Govern¬
ment, which now owns and maintains some 452,000 acres of Land Settlement
Estates with over 4,200 holdings.
There are about 100,000 domestic pig keepers in England and Wales and about
500,000 domestic poultry keepers. They are encouraged by the Small Pig Keepers’
Council and the National Domestic Poultry Keepers’ Council, respectively, pro¬
moted by the Ministry of Agriculture. In Northern Ireland there are 82,000
poultry keepers and 36,000 pig keepers.
Agricultural Advisory Services
Free technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural matters is available to
every farmer and grower in England and Wales through the Ministry of Agri¬
culture’s National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS).
Every county is divided into districts, to each of which District Advisory
An allotment garden is legally defined as an allotment not exceeding 40 poles (1,210
square yards) in extent, which is wholly or mainly cultivated by the occupier for the
production of vegetable or fruit crops for consumption by himself or his family.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
140
Officers have been appointed to act as general advisers to farmers. The District
Officers can call on an extensive system of specialist advisers. Advisers in general
agriculture, livestock husbandry, milk production, farm machinery, poultry
husbandry, and horticulture are available in each county, at the 12 provincial
centres and sub-centres there are senior advisers in these subjects and in crop and
grassland husbandry, besides specialists in animal nutrition, bacteriology, soil
chemistry, plant diseases and plant pests. These centres are equipped with labora¬
tories for the analysis of soils and feedings tuffs, and the diagnosis of crop pests and
diseases.
In Scotland the advisory services, similar in scope to the NAAS, are based on
the three agricultural colleges. Northern Ireland has its own separate advisory
service which is closely linked with the research and experimental divisions
(see p. 145).
Drainage and Water Schemes
The State makes substantial contributions towards the cost of land drainage
and water supply in Britain. In England and Wales, for example, under various
Acts grants for farm drainage may be up to 50 per cent of the approved cost; for
main river drainage they can range up to 80 per cent. Farm water supply grants
are at the rate of 25 per cent of the approved cost where the connection is to a
public main and 40 per cent where a private source is utilized. Separate, but
similar, legislation applies to Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The estimated cost of drainage and water schemes approved for State aid
amounts to:
England and Wales (to 31st March 1954)
Farm drainage (since 1940)—£28 million.
Main rivers (since 1930)—over £29 million.
Minor arterial drainage (since 1937)—over £11 million.
Farm water supply (since 1941)—over £16 million.
Scotland (to 31st March 1954)
Farm drainage and arterial drainage (since 194°) sCvi million.
Farm water supplies (since 1942)—£2^ million.
Northern Ireland (to 31st March 1954)
Farm drainage and arterial drainage (since 1942)—£2% million.
Farm water supplies (since 1942)—million.
Main rivers (since 1947)—over £850,000.
Farm Buildings
The provision of many more farm buildings for the industry, including steel
Dutch bams and buildings to house grain-drying and grass-drying plants, is being
facilitated.
A scheme for the large-scale production of standardized components for farm
buildings was announced in February 1948. The Ministry of Works, the building
trade and agricultural organizations have co-operated in preparing the scheme,
which provides components for buildings that will suit a wide range of agricultural
and horticultural purposes. With these components, buildings either 18 ft. or 33 ft.
wide can be constructed to a height of 8 ft., 12 ft. or 16 ft. in bays of 15 ft- The
available length is any multiple of 15 ft. With the decontrol of steel the Ministry
is no longer required to give special facilities to manufacturers of these components,
but there is every reason to suppose that continuing use will be made of standard
components for the construction of farm buildings.
INDUSTRY
141
Crops and Grass
Research at the Grassland Research Institute, Hurley, and elsewhere has
directly influenced agricultural practice, notably in the development of scientific
grassland management and the extension of ley-farming in districts where formerly
this alternating husbandry system has not been the usual practice; in the choice of
crop varieties, in crop husbandry; in the application of insecticides and fungicides;
and in the use of disease-free planting material.
The aim of Government policy is the maintenance of a large tillage area; the
efficient production of cereals; and the economic use of concentrates and their
substitution by grass, grass silage, and fodder crops such as kale.
Animal Husbandry
Britain is noted for its exports of pedigree livestock and since the end of the war
there has been a marked recovery of the export trade in livestock of high quality.
Horses. To ensure that quality is maintained, stallions must be licensed whether
they travel or stand for service at home. Grants are paid to approved societies
hiring out pedigree stallions of heavy breeds. The number of farm horses has
fallen by half since 1939 because of mechanization.
Cattle. It is mainly the beef breeds (e.g., Shorthorns, Herefords, Aberdeen
Angus) which have made a reputation overseas, but interest in British dairy stock
is increasing. The rise in milk consumption since 194° has resulted in concentra¬
tion at home on dairy breeds, but, in spite of the change-over to milk, many breeds
have maintained the dual-purpose type of qualifications. In Scotland, while milk
production has expanded, an even greater increase in numbers of beef cattle has
taken place. Schemes for communal use of sires are in operation, with special
schemes in the Highlands and Islands for the loan of bulls and rams (free of charge)
to communities of smallholders. Cattle-rearing in the United Kingdom is en¬
couraged by subsidies on calves reared for beef production and on hill cattle.
Northern Ireland sends to Great Britain all fatstock surplus to its own requirements.
Licensing schemes operate for bulls and boars in order to ensure sound breeding.
Artificial insemination (AI) centres, which are officially licensed, cover practically
the whole of England and Wales and licensed centres are also operating in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland AI is carried out at centres under the control of the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Agriculture. Over one-third of the dairy cows in England and
Wales are artificially inseminated.
Under a plan introduced in October 1950 for the eradication of bovine tubercu¬
losis on an area basis, areas containing about one million cattle have already been
cleared. Others are being cleared. At the end of 1953 there were 112,000 attested
herds (over 4 million cattle) in Great Britain. Northern Ireland has had an Attested
Herds Scheme in operation since 1949; there are 1,428 attested herds (47,485 head
of cattle).
Milk. Since October 1949 all dairy farms in Great Britain must be registered,
and regulations lay down conditions under which milk is produced, handled,
treated and stored. Milk may be sold, subject to licence, under special designations :
‘Tuberculin Tested’ (TT), ‘Accredited’ (in Scotland ‘Standard’), ‘Pasteurized’, and
‘Sterilized’. It is intended that ultimately there will be facilities for the heat treat¬
ment of all milk that is not tuberculin-tested. Premiums are paid on TT and
accredited milk and a bonus on attested herds.
In Northern Ireland milk has been paid for on a quality basis since 1934. The
whole of Northern Ireland is now a ‘safe milk’ area.
X42 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sheep. The best mutton and lamb throughout the world is largely of British
origin. At home, modem farming conditions have led to a decline in ‘arable flocks
(i.e. flocks feeding off root and forage crops grown in rotation with, for example,
barley) and an increase in grass-reared sheep.
Poultry. To raise the standard of poultry stock there is a Poultry Stock Improve¬
ment Plan under which breeding stations and hatcheries are accredited. By
December 1953 accredited breeding stock amounted to approximately 2,850,000
birds in England and Wales. Similar schemes operate in Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
Improvement of Livestock Rearing Land in Upland Areas
The Hill Farming and Livestock Rearing Acts provide for grants for owners and
occupiers of livestock rearing land in upland areas who wish to put their farms into
sound working order. The object is to encourage the breeding and rearing of store

cattle and store sheep (i.e. cattle and sheep for further fattening, not for immediate
slaughter). Grants are at the rate of 50 per cent of the cost of work done. The total
amount available for grant in the United Kingdom is £20 million and this can be
increased by £2 million if necessary.
Marginal Production Schemes
Grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost can be given to occupiers of agricultural
land to help them in farming operations which would be temporarily uneconomic
without assistance but which would eventually enable them to increase production.
About £2 million is being provided for this kind of assistance in 1954-55.
Mechanization
Mechanization has been one of the important causes of the increase of produc¬
tivity of labour on the land in recent years, and one of the aims of the policy
of guarantees to farmers under the Agriculture Act, 1947, was to give them an

opportunity to invest in capital equipment. Such investment is also encouraged by
the tax allowance on capital investment, which was increased in the 1954 Budget.
The estimated number of tractors (excluding small market-garden types) in the
United Kingdom in 1925 was about 21,000, in 1939 about 55,000, and in 1954 about
400,000. According to the Economic Commission for Europe, Britain has the
greatest tractor density in the world, one tractor per 57 acres of arable land. The
increase in some of the newer agricultural machines has been even more notable;
thus it is estimated that 24,000 combined harvester-threshers were in use in the
1954 harvest; in 1939 there were only 150. As so often happens in agriculture the
solution of one problem creates another; in a climate such as Britain’s, the wide¬
spread use of these combines gives rise to the need for grain-drying and grain-
storage facilities on a substantial scale. How to provide these on sound technical
and economic lines is a problem which is receiving the closest attention by the many
public and private interests concerned.
Considerable, but as yet not complete, success has attended intensive efforts to
solve the problem of mechanizing the cultivation and harvesting of root crops—
especially potatoes and sugar beet—which make so heavy a seasonal demand on
labour. The problem continues to receive close attention.
Great strides have been made in the development of a wide range of equipment
to assist the production of grass in the various forms—silage, hay and dried grass—
upon which British farm livestock very largely depends.
The National Institute of Agricultural Engineering carries out research, testing
and development work in agricultural engineering, and the Agricultural Machinery
Advisory Committee, representative of the industries and Government Depart¬
ments concerned, advises on requirements and on the supply of machinery
and the development and production of new machines.
The home agricultural engineering industry in 1939 made goods to the value (ex
works) of no more than £4^ million. In 1953 the output was valued at £94 million,
about £49 million of which was exported (see p. 181). Making full allowance for
increased prices, this represents a tenfold increase.
To meet the needs of farmers with insufficient equipment of their own, more
than 5,000 tractors as well as other types of agricultural machinery were owned
in 1954 by County Agricultural Executive Committees in England and Wales and
by private firms of contractors.
RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Agricultural Research in Britain is planned and co-ordinated by the Agricultural
Research Council (see pp. 346-8). This body advises the Agricultural Departments
(see p. 133) on scientific matters affecting the grant-aided Agricultural Research
Institutes (15 in England and Wales and 7 in Scotland, listed in footnote 1, p. 347)
and itself controls 14 research centres (listed in footnote 1, p. 348).
The exchange of information on research in other Commonwealth countries
takes place through the machinery of the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux
and Institutes (ten bureaux and two institutes in the United Kingdom and one
institute in Canada, see p. 354).
The Agricultural Improvement Council for England and Wales and the Scottish
Agricultural Improvement Council advise the Agricultural Departments on prob¬
lems requiring investigation and on the application of the results of scientific
investigation to farming practice. In reconstructing the Council in 1953, at the
end of a three-year period of office, the Minister included a prominent landowner
and a land agent to assist the Council to devote more attention to problems of
estate management, including buildings and fixed equipment.
INDUSTRY
145
Research and advice are combined in the Provincial Agricultural Economics
Service of England and Wales. The service is attached to the universities and
organized in ten economic advisory centres. In Scotland the Department of
Agriculture has a Farm Economics Branch, and agricultural economists are on the
staff of the three Agricultural Colleges. Similar arrangements exist in Northern
Ireland.
Facilities are provided at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Experimental
Centres in England and Wales and at Agricultural College Centres in Scotland
for field-scale extensions of research work and investigations of local problems.
Experiments are also carried out at provincial advisory centres and on commercial
farms.
The Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland has its own research divisions
investigating problems of animal and crop production. The research divisions work
in close touch with the Ministry’s county staffs, and also provide technical advisory
services for the farmer. A very close link has been forged between the Queen’s
University of Belfast and the research divisions, since certain officers of the latter
are professors and lecture in the University Faculty of Agriculture.
Control is also exercised by the Plant Disease Division in the disinfection of all
flax seed sown in Northern Ireland. A well-equipped Dairy Bacteriology Division
keeps a watchful eye on the maintenance of the hygienic standards laid down foi
the production and handling of milk.
At Hillsborough, in County Down, the Northern Ireland Agriculture Research
Institute owns and operates a farm of some 500 acres. The Institute is endowed
from public funds, and therefore the officers of the Ministry’s Research Divisions
are afforded facilities for carrying out their field experiments. Another 500 acres
at Hillsborough are devoted to forestry and are controlled by the Forestry Branch
of the Ministry of Agriculture. Thus there is a close integration of research,
education and advisory work in these research divisions.
Eight universities in England and Wales (Cambridge, Durham, Leeds, London,
Oxford, Nottingham, Reading, and the University of Wales) and three in Scotland
(Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen) provide degree courses in agriculture, which
are of particular value for intending research workers, advisory officers, teachers
and other specialists; in Northern Ireland a degree course is provided at Queen’s
University, Belfast. Two-year diploma courses are given at four Agricultural
Colleges and at two of the Farm Institutes in England and Wales; three Agri¬
cultural Colleges in Scotland give two- to three-year diploma courses. These are
more practical than degree courses and are intended mainly for farmers and farm
managers. These courses are also a preparation for the National Diplomas in
Agriculture, Dairying, Horticulture and Poultry Husbandry. In Northern Ireland
there are three Agricultural Colleges.
There are 33 Farm Institutes and three Horticultural Institutes in England and
Wales and six farm schools in Scotland run by local education authorities pro¬
viding courses in general agriculture, dairying, poultry, horticulture and poultry
husbandry. Courses are usually for one year of 33 to 40 working weeks. Various
short courses are run during the vacations, and local education authorities
provide a wide range of part-time instruction which also meets the needs of the
domestic producer.
An important means of voluntary informal education in agriculture is provided
by Young Farmers' Clubs, which flourish in villages and towns throughout the
United Kingdom. There are in all some 1,462 clubs with about 67,228 members,
mostly between the ages of 10 and 25. Each club is self-governing but has the
support of an advisory committee of farmers and other adults and of the local
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
146
organizer. Clubs are combined in county federations and in National Federations
for England and Wales (founded in 1932), Scotland (in 1937). and Northern
Ireland (in 1929).
The National Federation of Women’s Institutes is another important voluntary
organization, with over 8,000 Institutes in villages throughout England and Wales.
Their aim is to improve rural life and amenities, and they are interested in all
subjects of general, agricultural and social significance to country women. The
Scottish Women’s Rural Institutes have similar aims and interests.
Rural crafts and industries are fostered by the Rural Industries Bureau, founded
in 1921, which is financed almost wholly by grants from the Development Fund
set up under the Development Acts of 1909 and 1910. These Acts gave the Govern¬
ment power to make grants and loans from this Fund for certain specified purposes
including the promotion of rural industries. The Bureau provides an information
and advisory service which helps country craftsmen in England and Wales to keep
abreast of new developments while at the same time preserving their ancient
skills. Advice and instruction are given on the commercial as well as the technical
aspects of rural industries.
FISHERIES
Britain’s fishing industry falls into two main divisions: demersal and pelagic.1
There are also fisheries for oysters, cockles, mussels and whelks from the Thames
Estuary to the Wash, and on the Cornish and South Wales coasts; for lobsters and
crabs off the Scottish coasts and off the north-east, east and south coasts of England;
and for shrimps in the Wash, East Anglia, the Thames Estuary, and Morecambe
Bay on the north-west coast of England.
There were 27,414 fishermen regularly employed in Great Britain at the end of
I953- The landed weight of British-caught wet fish amounted to nearly 19,000 tons
per week; consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish in Great Britain amounted
to about 16,230 tons landed weight per week.
Northern Ireland consumes about one-third of its own catches and exports the
rest to Great Britain and to the Irish Republic.
Fishing Ports
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Grimsby, Hull, Fleetwood,
Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft
for herring; in Scotland the chief centres are Aberdeen and Granton for white fish,
which are caught all round the coast and particularly in the Moray Firth, and for
herring Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Shetland, Stornoway, the West Coast and the
Clyde; those in Northern Ireland are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel. London is
the principal wholesale distributing centre, and Billingsgate Fish Market handles
an average of 600 tons a day.
Sea Fishing
The chief means of catching fish are by the use of nets—trawl, seine, drift and
ring—and by lining. Trawling is carried on in distant, middle and near waters for
demersal fish throughout the year, and seasonally for herring. The deep-sea trawler
fleet comprised 1,014 vessels at the end of 1953. Seining is chiefly used on the
nearer grounds, the principal catches being plaice and haddock; 569 Scottish
vessels engage in seine net fishing during most of the year, while from Grimsby,
1 Demersal fish (white fish) live on or near the sea-bed (e.g., cod, haddock, plaice,
turbot, sole, etc.). Pelagic fish live in the intermediate waters or near the surface (e.g.,
herring, pilchard, mackerel, sprats, etc.).
INDUSTRY
147
Fleetwood and Whitehaven 74 such vessels are in regular operation. In Northern
Ireland fishermen also use seine nets. Drift nets are mainly used for herring and
pilchard by 398 steam and motor drifters; ring netting, a method of catching
herring, is used seasonally in certain districts by about 200 motor-boats. Long
lining on grounds too rough for trawling is carried on by a limited number of
vessels (mainly Scottish), while small and hand lining still provide employment
for a large number of crews in autumn, winter and early spring; cod, whiting and
mackerel are caught.
The quantity and value of fish landed in the United Kingdom during the year
ended 31st December 1953 were as follows:
Wet Fish (demersal and pelagic)
Great Britain: 980,338 tons valued at £40,999,622.
Northern Ireland: 5,674 tons valued at £137,359.
Shell Fish
Great Britain: value £1,229,831.
Northern Ireland: value £4,814.
Exports of fish from the United Kingdom—fresh, frozen, cured or canned—in
1953 were valued at £5,254,159.
Freshwater Fisheries
The principal commercial freshwater catches are salmon, grilse, sea-trout and
eels. In Scotland and Northern Ireland fixed nets along the coast and sweep nets
in rivers and estuaries are used; in England drift nets are used for catching salmon
in the sea. In England and Wales the value of the salmon catch is approximately
£195,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to about £1 million, and in Northern Ireland
to some £200,000. In Northern Ireland eels are captured by long lines and by eel
nets placed in special gaps in river weirs.
Sporting fishing is by rod and line in lakes, lochs, rivers and streams. Salmon,
grilse and sea-trout are the most important species, and the fishing rights command
high rentals. There are also extensive fishings for brown trout. Other freshwater
fish taken, particularly in England, are roach, rudd, perch and dace. Fishing for
freshwater fish other than salmon and trout is of minor importance and figures of
catches are not available.
Promotion and Regulation of the Industry
Laws in Britain relating to fisheries and fish are principally directed to the
following purposes: (a) protection of supply by measures against over-fishing,
e.g., the Sea Fisheries Regulation Acts, 1888 to 1930, and the Sea Fishing Industry
Acts, 1933 to 1938; (b) promotion of the prosperity of the industry, e.g., the
Herring Industry Acts, 1935 to 1953, and the White Fish Industry Acts, 1951 to
*953! (c) protection of the quality of the product, e.g., the Food and Drugs Act,
1938. The Government Departments mainly responsible for the administration of
laws in the first two categories and for the general sponsorship of fisheries are
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (see p. 39), the Scottish Home Depart¬
ment, and the Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland; the Ministry of Food
(see p. 42) is concerned with questions of processing and distribution, and, together
with the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland, with
questions of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant Shipping
Acts, which are administered by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are the Ministry of Agriculture

148
and Fisheries, the Scottish Home Department and the Development Commissioners
(see p. 350).
An Order made by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary of
State for Scotland and the Home Secretary in January 1954 prescribed new and
larger minimum sizes of mesh for nets used by British fishing vessels. The Order,
which came into operation on 5th April 1954, fulfilled an obligation on the part
of the United Kingdom Government to give effect to decisions taken in November
I953 by the Permanent Commission set up under the International Fisheries
Convention of 1946.
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act of 1935,
to reorganize, develop and regulate the herring industry: subsequent amending
Acts have also been passed. The Board is financed partly by Government grants
and loans and partly by levies and licence fees. It consists of a chairman and two
other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed
jointly by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture and
Fisheries and the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The Board
promotes sales of herring both at home and abroad, encourages and carries
out schemes of research and experiment into methods of fishing and processing,
makes grants and loans for the acquisition of new boats and engines, and loans
for the purchase of nets and gear, for the provision of processing plants, and
for the reconditioning of existing boats, and exercises a measure of control over
the industry by means of rules, directions and licensing. It operates a scheme
for the reduction of herring to oil and meal, using its own and commercial process¬
ing plants. In August 1951 the Board was given powers to participate in the industry,
including fishing for herring, and purchasing, processing and selling herring;
such powers, however, are to be used only to secure proper provision for the needs
of the industry and after consultation with the interests concerned. The Board is
assisted by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, representing various sections
of the industry and consumers, and by local officers who work at the ports during
the fishing season, and who on occasion act as port arbiters in disputes regarding
herring sales. Sectional committees may be set up to advise the Board on matters
affecting a particular section of the industry.
The White Fish Authority was set up by the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, to
reorganize, develop and regulate the white fish industry. The Authority is financed
partly by Government grants and loans and partly by a levy on first-hand sales
and by registration fees. It is composed of five independent members, appointed
jointly by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Secretary of State for the Home Department, working in
consultation with the industry and consumers through the White Fish Industry
Advisory Council. The Authority has powers, similar to those of the Herring
Board, to carry on research and experiment, to encourage the formation and
development of voluntary arrangements in the industry on a co-operative basis,
to promote exports, to make grants and loans for the acquisition of new boats
and engines, and loans for the purchase of nets and gear for the provision and
reconditioning of processing plants and for the reconditioning of existing boats.
Certain of the Authority’s functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland have been
delegated to a committee consisting of Scottish and Northern Irish members.
FORESTRY
Only a relatively small part of Britain’s timber requirements is met from its own
woodlands; the greater part—to the value of £166 million in 1953—is supplied by
INDUSTRY
149
imports. In recent years, however, the Government has been devoting continuous
effort through the Forestry Commission to the long-term task of increasing the
country’s timber resources, which over the centuries, and particularly as a result of
overfelling in the two world wars, have been seriously depleted.
Forest Areas
The last census of woodlands (1947-49) disclosed that the total area of woodland
in Great Britain on 30th September 1947, excluding woods under 5 acres in extent,
was 3,448,362 acres. This represents 6-i per cent of the land surface of the countries
surveyed, or 71 acres of woodland for every 1,000 of the population.
According to the census figures, 3,412,388 acres, or 99 per cent of the total area
of woodland, were on the mainland and 1 per cent distributed over various islands.
England, with 1,865,046 acres, had 54 per cent of the whole; Scotland, with
1,266,838 acres,1 had 37 per cent of the whole; and Wales, with 316,478 acres, had
9 per cent of the whole.
The greatest density of woodland in Great Britain is to be found in the north and
east of Scotland, where the census showed that ten counties all had 8 per cent or
more of their land area under woodland—Moray, for example, had 2i-6 per cent
and Nairn 19-1 per cent. The second region of high density lies in the south-east of
England and comprises the following five counties: Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire (in
which is to be found the well-known New Forest), Kent and Berkshire. Monmouth¬
shire, on the Welsh border, had 10-7 per cent of its land area under woodland at
the time of the census. Every county contains some measurable woodland; the
census disclosed that even the administrative county of London had 639 acres.
Types of Woodland
Fifty-two per cent of the total woodland area in Great Britain as a whole was
classified in the census as High Forest, which consists of stands of trees that are
normally grown to maturity from planting, sowing, natural regeneration or, occa¬
sionally, from coppice shoots; 10 per cent was classified as Coppice (woodland in
which the crop is worked or could be worked on the coppice system); 15 per cent
as Scrub; and 23 per cent as Felled or Devastated.
Woods which are wholly or mainly coniferous occupy a slightly larger area in the
High Forest of Great Britain as a whole than do the broadleaved species; in
Scotland coniferous woods predominate, with 79 per cent of the total, the broad¬
leaved species accounting for only 21 per cent. In England, broadleaved species
occupy 63 per cent, oak accounting for 33 per cent, beech for 11 per cent, ash for
7 per cent, birch for 5 per cent, sycamore for 4 per cent, and Spanish chestnut, elm,
and other broadleaved trees for 1 per cent each. In coniferous woods, which make
up 37 per cent of the total, the Scots pine is the most common tree, and accounts
for 14 per cent of the total. In Wales, where the conifers again predominate
(although only by a small margin), the most common species are the Norway and
Sitka spruces, which account for 29 per cent of the total. The broadleaved trees,
amounting to 45 per cent in all, consist mainly of oak, which forms 26 per cent of
the whole.
Volume of Timber
The timber volume of Great Britain’s woodlands (timber over 3 inches in
diameter) at 30th September 1949 was estimated at approximately 2,650 million
1 Some 15,000 acres of woodlands, mostly conifers, in the north-east of Scotland ■were
blown down by the gales of 31st January 195 3 which coincided with the flood disaster on
the east Coast of Britain.

ISO
cubic feet, the hardwood amounting to approximately 1,550 million cubic feet, and
the softwood to approximately 1,100 million cubic feet. The total annual growth of
timber was estimated at approximately 97 million cubic feet.
Ownership of Woodlands
Eighty-two per cent of all woodlands in Great Britain is owned by private indivi¬
duals or by limited companies, trusts, corporations, local authorities or Government
departments other than the Forestry Commission. The remaining 18 per cent is
under the management of the Forestry Commission.
The Forestry Commission
The Forestry Commission was established under the Forestry Act, 1919-47, to
promote the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the produc¬
tion and supply of timber in Great Britain. Under the Forestry Acts, 1945, the
Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland
became jointly responsible for forest policy; the Forestry Commission continued to
carry out forestry operations, research and the training of foresters; and since 1950
it has been the licensing authority for the felling of timber. The Forestry Act, 1951,
placed responsibility on the Commissioners for the maintenance of an adequate
reserve of growing trees.
During the years 1919-531 the Forestry Commission acquired 1,909,400 acres of
land through the Forestry Fund2 and under the Transfer of Woods Act, 1923. This
total comprises 1,181,400 acres classified as ‘forest land’, which is either planted or
will be planted in due course, and 728,000 acres of ‘other land’ which includes
forest nurseries, rough grazing, agricultural land and land unsuitable for planting
on account of soil conditions and locality. The total number of Commission forests
in Great Britain at 30th September 1953 was 462, of which 193 were in England,
193 in Scotland and 76 in Wales.
Policy
Great Britain’s forest policy, laid down in the various Acts, is to extend State and
private operations so as to establish, over 50 years, 5 million acres of well-managed
woodlands, made up of 3 million acres of new planting by the Commission and the
replanting by the Commission and private owners of 2 million acres of existing
woodland. The annual yield from these 5 million acres should be about 35 per cent
of the national timber requirements.
The restoration of privately owned woodlands is being assisted by the Dedication
Scheme, initiated by the Forestry Act, 1947, under which owners are invited to
agree to their land being given over permanently to timber production and to their
woods being managed in accordance with a plan approved by the Forestry Com¬
mission ; in return the owner is entitled to financial aid in the form of grants.
Forestry Education and Research
The Commission maintains five forester-training schools: in England, at Parkend
in Gloucestershire, and at Lynford in Norfolk; in Wales, at Gwydyr in Carnarvon¬
shire; and at Benmore and Faskally, near Pitlochry, in Scotland. Northerwood
House, the Commission’s educational centre in the New Forest, Hampshire, is
used for practical courses for university students, landowners, school teachers
and others connected with forestry.

INDUSTRY
151
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities, suitable graduates
being recruited by the Commission as forest officers.
In 1946 Alice Holt Lodge, Farnham, Surrey, was opened by the Commission as
a forestry research station. Grants are made for research on special forestry problems
of a fundamental scientific nature to be carried out by universities and other institu¬
tions qualified to undertake such work. Expenditure on research and experiment in
1953 amounted to £215,330.
Finance
The Forestry bund was established in 1919 2nd from it is paid all the expenditure
of the Forestry Commissioners. The fund is replenished by sums voted annually by
Parliament, receipts from forest produce, rentals and other sources. From 1920 to
1953 Parliamentary votes totalled £54,586,800 and receipts £18,029,060. Payments
were £72,403,480.
National Forest Parks
The Forestry Commission has opened to the public seven National Forest Parks:
Argyll, Glentrool, Glenmore, and Loch Ard (renamed the Queen Elizabeth Forest
Park to commemorate the Coronation Year) in Scotland; Hardknott, Forest of
Dean and Snowdonia in England and Wales. The total area of these parks is about
290,000 acres; they include planted areas and unplantable moorland and mountains.
Camping facilities are provided in most of the Forest Parks, and the number of over¬
night stays at the camping grounds exceeded 64,000 in 1953.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, forestry has been the responsibility of the Ministry of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland since 1922. At that date the Government had
acquired some 4,000 acres for afforestation, of which 700 acres had been planted.
Since then the State forest area has grown steadily, and at a greatly accelerated pace
since the end of the second world war. By 31st March 1954, 62,000 acres had been
acquired for State afforestation, of which approximately 36,000 acres had been
planted. The area of exploitable private woodland is at present some 20,000 acres,
and private planting is assisted both by the supply of young trees at cost price from
the Government nurseries and by grants towards the cost of new plantations.
FUEL AND POWER
The most important primary sources of the fuel and power used in Britain are
coal and petroleum, and the most important secondary sources are electricity
(including hydro-electricity) and coal gas. Normally, inland coal requirements are
met from within the country; supplies from the mines also afford substantial exports.
Nearly all petroleum is imported (most of it as crude oil) and refined within the
country, only a little being produced from coal, shale and local oil wells. The fuel
and power industries, with the exception of the petroleum industry and coal distribu¬
tion, are mainly under public ownership.
The Government’s fuel and power policy has broadly three objectives: to
obtain more coal; to use the coal better; and to supplement supplies of coal with
other sources of energy—atomic energy as soon as possible, natural gas if it can
be found, and oil forthwith.
COAL
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organized coalmining
industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years longer than in any
L
152
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
other European country. British coal exports dominated the world coal market until
about 1910. By 1913—the peak year—the industry was producing 287 million tons
of coal, exporting 94 million tons and employing 1,107,000 workers.
The very fact that the British coalmining industry was developed so early has
meant that many of the best seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal
has to be mined from deeper and thinner seams and there is a constant struggle to
maintain productivity at its present level.
The industry declined during the first world war owing to a shortage of man¬
power and to the shortage of plant and materials necessary for undertaking any
mechanical improvement. Moreover, alternative sources of energy and lower prices
in continental countries led to a later decline in exports, which had fallen to 67
million tons in 1925.
Attempts at securing economies through amalgamation date from the Sankey
Commission of 1919. In 1930 a Coal Mines Act established commissioners
to bring about the formation of larger and more efficient units. The Coal Act
of 1938 transferred ownership of the mineral coal to the State and made it the
statutory responsibility of a Coal Commission to accelerate the integration of the
industry by still further reducing the number of separate undertakings. At the
outbreak of the second world war in 1939, however, this process was not far
advanced.
Organization under Public Ownership
In 1942 the Government assumed full control of the industry’s operations,
though the colliery undertakings continued to own the coal mines. In May 1946
the Coal Industry Nationalization Act received the Royal Assent; on 1st January
1947 the whole coalmining industry was transferred to public ownership and con¬
trol and the National Coal Board, appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power and
now consisting of a chairman, two deputy chairmen, four full-time and four part-
time members, was set up and made responsible for its efficient operation. The
Board is a public corporation and is responsible for its own regional organiza¬
tion.
There are minor exceptions to the Board’s exclusive monopoly to work coal in
Britain: for example, it may license private enterprise to work small mines in which
the number of underground workers does not greatly exceed 30. Production on
opencast sites, which had been the responsibility of the Ministry of Fuel and
Power, was transferred to the Board on 1st April 1952.
The main coal-bearing areas, roughly in order of output, are to be found in
Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Durham and Northumberland,
Central Scotland, South Wales, Lancashire and North Wales, Staffordshire,
Warwickshire and Leicestershire. There are no coal-bearing areas in Northern
Ireland. Under the National Coal Board’s organization, the collieries, numbering
about 900, are grouped into 50 Areas which are the basic units for commercial
management. The size of the Areas varies according to geological, geographical and
other technical considerations. Some of the larger Areas are split up into sub-Areas
the managements of which are responsible to Area managements for the operation of
groups of collieries within the sub-Area. The Areas are grouped into nine Divisions
which roughly correspond to the main coal-bearing regions. A Divisional Board for
each Division supervises and co-ordinates the work of the Areas within the Divi¬
sion, formulates divisional policy, and is answerable to the National Coal Board,
which is responsible for questions of national policy, finance and the co-ordinating
of major schemes of development. The day-to-day work of running the collieries is
under the direction of colliery managers.
INDUSTRY
153
Employment1 and Production
Employment and production in the coalmining industry, after rising again in
the years immediately following the first world war, fell later owing to loss of
export markets and depression in the heavy industries at home. In the years since
the second world war, the trend has been upwards. In 1952 output reached a
post-war peak of 226-5 million tons. In 1953, however, the Coronation holiday,
together with the grant to the miners of a second week’s paid holiday, reduced
output by 5J million tons; most of this loss was made good by higher output in
the remainder of the year, but even so, total output fell to 224-2 million tons.
Total manpower in June 1954 was 708,000, of which 290,800 represented workers
at the coal face. Table 22 shows the progress of the National Coal Board since its
inception.
Development and Research
Contraction and curtailment of development in the industry since the peak
year, i9i3> bad led to a position in which less than one-third of current output
was coming from pits started in the twentieth century. Large-scale development
was therefore essential.
In 1950 the National Coal Board announced its long-term plan of development
for the industry involving the reorganization and increased mechanization of exist¬
ing mines and the sinking of new ones. The plan envisaged a capital investment of
£635 million at 1949 prices between 1950 and 1965, when it was estimated that the
annual output of coal would have risen to about 240 million tons. The plan was not
a rigid blueprint, room being left for modifications in the light of changing circum¬
stances and new knowledge. Actual capital expenditure in the years 1950-53 was
£173 million at current prices. When the programme is completed, four-fifths of
Britain’s coal will be coming from virtually new mines.
In 1947 the National Coal Board took over, with other assets, the Coal Survey, a
national organization for surveying coal resources within Britain, and 70 labora¬
tories in the various coalfields, which it has since extended and modernized.
In 1948 the Board established a central research organization at Stoke Orchard,
near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to provide facilities for fundamental research in
the coalmining industry, as distinct from the day-to-day scientific control exercised
by the divisional and area scientific organization. A second central research organiza¬
tion for the investigation of underground problems was formed in 1952 by
the Board at Isleworth, Middlesex, and a Central Engineering Establishment is
being built near Bretby in Derbyshire for developing new machines and equip¬
ment.
The Board also subscribes to a number of autonomous research associations in
receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)
(see p. 344), including the British Coal Utilization Research Association, the British
Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar Research Association. In addition
much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety in Mines Research Establish¬
ment of the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Fuel Research Station of DSIR,
is closely related to the Board’s problems.
Various estimates have been made of the country’s workable reserves. The latest
was made by the Coal Survey in 1946 which considered there was certainly sufficient
coal to maintain output for 100 years but that in some places economically workable
reserves, particularly of special coals, would be worked out sooner.
1 Further references to conditions of employment, labour relations, welfare, and the
special legislation for safety in mines will be found on pp. 242—4.

PETROLEUM
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young a
Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from natural
mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish shale deposits
yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858.
Indigenous Production
Sources of crude oil within Britain (including shale oil) supply altogether less
than 1 per cent of total United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being
imported from overseas.
Current output of shale oil is drawn from 11 shale mines, retorted in four crude
oil works and the crude products are refined in a central refinery at Pumpherston,
near Edinburgh. Output of shale reached a peak of 3J million tons in 1913, but the
cost of the processes and other economic difficulties led to a reduction of output
This at present averages million tons a year, yielding, in 1953, some 104,000 tons
of crude shale oil. From the latter some 100,000 tons of refined products were
obtained. In 1953 some 110,000 tons of motor and aviation spirit were obtained from
coal by hydrogenation, and 280,000 tons of refined benzole from coke ovens and
gas works. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establishment of
four oilfields in Nottinghamshire (small amounts of oil were found in further
borings at Plungar in Leicestershire in 1953), one in Lancashire and one very
small field in Scotland.
International Trade
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the Middle
East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today they produce one-third of all oil entering into international trade, with a
tanker fleet (part-owned by them and part on charter) amounting to about one-third
of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United Kingdom registered tanker tonnage is about
one-fifth of the world’s total.)
Consumption
Consumption of petroleum products in the United Kingdom has risen from just
over one million tons in 1900 (mostly kerosene for lamps, and lubricants) to over
19 million tons in 1953 (predominantly gas, diesel and fuel oils and motor spirit).
Refineries
Up to 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum products
was refined overseas, in accordance with the view, commonly held in the world oil
industry at that time, that it was more economical to refine at the source of produc¬
tion. Since the second world war, however, the industry has come to favour the
siting of refineries in the consuming areas. In this it has had Government support,
both because of the need to save foreign exchange and because of the extra employ¬
ment and other advantages to the economy resulting from the new development.
The expansion programme of the United Kingdom was a substantial one, costing
over the years 1947 to 1953 verY nearly £200 million.
At the end of 1953 refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted to almost
28 million tons per annum; actual production of refined products rose from about
5 million tons in 1948-49 to 23-4 million tons in 1953. Exports of refined products
156 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
became possible, and their value reached over JC71 million in i953> while in the
same year that of imports of refined products were valued at £9° million compared
with £141 million in 1951.
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
Public supply of electricity was first demonstrated at Godaiming, Surrey, in
1881, following the development of the vacuum carbon-filament lamp between
1875 and 1880. From the earliest days a measure of public control has been a
feature of the industry, and the Electric Lighting Act of 1882 authorized the Board
of Trade to grant exclusive rights to local authorities, and to companies which the
local authorities might ultimately take over, to supply consumers in a given area.
By the turn of the century technical developments had led to a large expansion
of distribution areas and the introduction of the electric motor as a source of motive
power, and a variety of independent supply systems had grown up all over the
country.
It was not until after the first world war that steps were taken to reorganize the
industry on a national scale in order to realize the benefits of a standard and inte¬
grated system of supply. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were set up as a
supervisory body and to secure reorganization through voluntary agreement. Then
in 1926 the Central Electricity Board was established to co-ordinate more efficiently
the generation of electricity. Its main duties were to concentrate the output of
electricity in certain stations, selected for their efficiency and low operating costs;
to connect these selected stations with one another and to local distribution under¬
takings by means of a national system of main transmission lines, known as the
Grid; and to establish a standard alternating current frequency of 50 cycles. Thence¬
forward steady progress was made in putting this plan into effect and, by March
1948, 143 selected stations, out of some 300, were supplying 95 per cent of the
electricity generated for public supply.
Organization under Public Ownership
With the exception of a few small non-statutory undertakings supplying a frac¬
tion of 1 per cent of the total supplies to the public, the electricity supply industry
in Great Britain is now entirely under public control.
When it was transferred to public ownership in April 1948, under the Electricity
Act of 1947, there was already in existence a North of Scotland Hydro-Electric
Board, set up in 1943 as a non-profit-making body to develop the water-power
resources of the Highlands and Islands and to distribute electricity in the more
sparsely populated parts of Scotland not covered by existing undertakings.
The Act of 1947, under which the British Electricity Authority and the Area
Electricity Boards took over the assets of the former municipal and private under¬
takings throughout the rest of Great Britain, made the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board solely responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland for all
generation and distribution in its area. This area was extended under the Act to
include that part of Scotland north and west of a line running roughly from
Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to a point just north of Newburgh on the Firth
of Tay. In the rest of Scotland, the British Electricity Authority, together with the
South-East and South-West Scotland Electricity Boards, was responsible to the
Minister of Fuel and Power in all electricity matters.
In 1954, however, the Electricity Reorganization (Scotland) Act provided for a
new South of Scotland Electricity Board, answerable to the Secretary of State for
Scotland, to be set up on 1st April 1955, which will take over the British Electricity
INDUSTRY
157
Authority’s functions in Scotland. The Minister of Fuel and Power will retain only
three functions in regard to electricity in Scotland, namely, to act jointly with the
Secretary of State in regard to staff pensions and safety measures, and to remain
solely responsible for the certification of meters.
The British Electricity Authority, the central authority of the electricity supply
organization, is a partly functional board, appointed by the Minister of Fuel and
Power, consisting of a chairman, two deputy-chairmen, and six to eight part-time
members. It is responsible to the Minister for the general policy of the whole
electricity supply industry originally throughout the whole of Great Britain
except the North of Scotland area, but, as from 1st April 1955, under legislation
already referred to, throughout England and Wales only. Its main function is to
develop and maintain an efficient co-ordinated and economical system of electricity
supply and it is responsible for the generation and bulk supply of electricity to
the statutory Area Boards.
The Area Boards are responsible for the distribution of electricity. Each consists
of a full-time chairman and deputy-chairman and four to six part-time members.
Area Consultative Councils have been set up in the area of each Area Board to
represent the interests of consumers. They each consist of between 20 and 30
members, of whom between 50 and 60 per cent are nominated by local authority
associations. The chairman of each Area Consultative Council is an ex-officio
member of the corresponding Area Board.
As part of its administrative arrangements, the Authority has established
Generation Divisions, the areas of which correspond in general with those of the
Area Boards.
At 31st March 1954, 50,400 persons were employed by the British Electricity
Authority (Headquarters and Generating Divisions) and 137,000 by Area Boards
and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board; a total of 187,400 of which 11-4
per cent were women.
In Northern Ireland, electricity is generated by two municipal undertakings and
one public board. The bulk of the electricity is acquired by the Northern Ireland
Joint Electricity Committee set up by statute in 1948, for sale to statutory distribu¬
tion undertakings. Of these the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland distributes
electricity throughout the country with the exception of the cities of Belfast and
Londonderry, where it is carried out by municipal undertakings.
Generation
Almost the whole of Britain’s electricity is produced in coal-fired steam generat¬
ing stations. Plentiful supplies of coal together with good rail and water transport
for moving the coal, in contrast with the remote and scattered location of water¬
power resources, led to this preponderant development of electricity supplies from
thermal generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any scale is
comparatively recent.
In I953» 64,068 million units (one unit=one kilowatt-hour), or 97-4 per cent of
the public supply in Great Britain, was generated at steam stations, 1,745 million
units, or 2-6 per cent, from water power, and 160 million units by other means, e.g.,
diesel and waste heat and refuse destruction. The high rate of expansion of output,
which has been a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has been continued
since the war. Total production in 1953 showed an increase of 5-8 per cent over
1952, and of nearly 76 per cent over 1945 (see Table 23).
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland in 1953 totalled over 757 million units.
Generating capacity of the public supply industry in Great Britain as a whole at
the end of 1953 totalled 19,256 megawatts (maximum continuous rating) compared

with 12,546 megawatts at the end of 1946. The Authority is at present implement¬
ing a large-scale programme of capital investment, for the regions it controls,
which includes the provision of an increase, between the years 1946 and 1955, of
10,600 megawatts (sent out).
The industry is the largest consumer of primary fuel in Britain and in 1953 it
used approximately 37 million tons, consisting mainly of coal. Average thermal
efficiency of steam stations (i.e. the ratio of power output to the coal consumed)
rose from 20-86 per cent in 1947-48 to 23-2 per cent in 1953 as new plant was
brought into use. For the first time in Britain, three stations in 1953 attained a
thermal efficiency of over 30 per cent, and altogether 11 stations operated through¬
out 1953 with efficiencies of over 28 per cent. A policy of standardization of equip¬
ment is being implemented wherever possible, especially in generators, boilers and
other plant. The two standard sizes of turbo-alternators are 30,000 kilowatts and
60,000 kilowatts, and most sets now installed are of these sizes, although larger
sizes up to 200,000 kilowatts are planned for operation by i960.
To meet increasing demands for electricity and to save coal, generation from
alternative fuels is being actively promoted. The chief alternatives are expected
to be oil and nuclear energy. As regards oil, dual firing apparatus able to use
either coal or oil is being fitted to a new power station at Marchwood, on Southamp¬
ton Water; and similar apparatus may be installed in other power stations similarly
situated on river estuaries and thus able to be fed conveniently from nearby oil
refineries. As regards nuclear energy, an experimental nuclear power plant is
being built by the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 348) at Calder Hall, Cumber¬
land, and a nuclear power reactor working on the ‘breeder’ principle at Dounreay,
Caithness, Scotland. Construction of nuclear power stations of an advanced type
before i960 is contemplated by the Government, and in July 1954 the British
Electricity Authority announced the setting up of a nuclear power branch of its
engineering department and the appointment of a nuclear power engineer.
Transmission and Distribution
Main transmission lines—the Grid—cover most of the country. Those of the
Authority totalled 4,682 route miles (6,471 circuit miles) at 31st March 1953, of
which 4,174 miles were operated at 132,000 volts and the remainder at 66,000 volts
and below. Operation of the Grid is effected through the Authority’s eight opera¬
tional areas, set up for the purpose and distinct from the divisions in which the
generating side of the industry is organized; each area has a central control station
and the operations are co-ordinated by the national control station in London.
INDUSTRY
159
In order to meet estimated demand during the next 20 years, a new Super-Grid
of main transmission lines at 275,000 volts, which will make British electricity
supply the most closely integrated power network in the world, is being promoted
by the Authority. The first stage, already in progress, is due for completion in 1955.
The Authority is also undertaking in conjunction with the corresponding French
organization—Electricite de France—experimental trials with the object of linking
British and French Grid systems by submarine cable in order to take advantage of
different peak periods in the two countries.
The Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers electricity acquired mainly
from the Authority, but in part from other sources, e.g., collieries. There were
14-6 million consumers in December 1953, an increase of approximately 4 million
on those supplied in March 1939. Industrial users are the group of consumers with
the highest consumption, and demand from this sector is increasing rapidly. The
principal domestic uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking, and for space and
water heating, but the demand for numerous other domestic purposes is increasing.
Sales of electricity in Great Britain for the years 1948-53 to the various classes of
consumers are shown in Table 24.

combined shops and domestic premises where a special tariff is enforced.
The development of electricity supplies for rural areas has been facilitated by the
change in the structure of the industry under the 1947 Act. During 1953 supplies
were provided for a further 13,411 farms which raised the total to approximately
158,500.
The Area Boards are required to promote the standardization of systems of
supply and types of electric fittings. The standardization of low-voltage supplies
had been under consideration for many years, and in 1945 it was decided that the
adoption of a voltage of 240 volts would be the practical and economic method of
standardization of alternating current low-voltage supplies. Implementation, how¬
ever, is restricted by shortage of labour and materials.
i6o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Development and Research
The comprehensive capital development plan to bridge the gap between ever-
increasing demand and supply is limited by shortages of equipment and finance.
Borrowing by the British Electricity Authority and Area Electricity Boards was
limited to a maximum of £700 million by the Electricity Act, 1947. By 30th June
1954, borrowings had been authorized up to a total of £635 million. Under the
Gas and Electricity (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1954, these powers were extended
to £1,400 million. Capital investment by the industry in i953~54 was approximately
£168 million.
The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board in 1943 marked
the beginning of a new era of intensive water-power development in the Highlands
of Scotland. A development scheme drawn up by the Board in 1944, showing the
water-power resources which it proposed to examine, listed 102 hydro-electric
projects with an estimated annual output of 6,274 million units of electricity. The
ultimate output of Highland hydro-electric power is expected to be substantially
higher and eventually may exceed 10,000 million units. In 1953, 913 million units
were generated from this source compared with 322 million in 1949.
The British Electricity Authority undertakes research and may require the Area
Boards to do so. Much of this research is carried out through the British Electrical
and Allied Industries Research Association, established before the supply industry
passed into public ownership. This is one of the 36 autonomous research associa¬
tions in receipt of grants from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
(see p. 344). But in July 1949 the Authority set up an Electrical Supply Research
Council to advise it and its Area Boards on problems affecting the supply and use
of electricity. The activities of this council, members of which include outside
experts as well as staff of the Authority and Area Boards, are said to be ‘complemen¬
tary to those of the various research bodies appointed by the Government’. Direct
research on a laboratory scale takes place at the British Electrical Laboratories, at
Leatherhead, Surrey, extensions to which were opened by the Authority in July
1950. In 1950-51 a Research Liaison Committee was set up to facilitate collabora¬
tion between Headquarters and Generation Division staff. In 1952-53 one of two
projected 15,000 kilowatt experimental gas turbine generating stations came into
experimental operation. Experiments are also being conducted on wind power
generation under the auspices of a joint committee of the British Electricity
Authority and the British Electrical and Allied Industries Research Association,
known as the Wind Power Generation Committee, which was set up in 1948.
Research is also conducted by the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.
GAS SUPPLY
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London, was
first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke
Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London. In the early years
of the industry, gas was used almost exclusively for lighting and was provided by a
growing number of company and municipal undertakings. Then, after the middle
of the century and the invention of the Bunsen burner in 1869, gas was used
increasingly as a source of heat for many purposes such as domestic cooking and
space and water heating, in addition to a number of industrial uses. After 1880,
however, gas for lighting purposes was subjected to increasing competition from
the new electricity supply industry; but the invention of the Welsbach incandescent
mantle in 1887, which raised the efficiency of gas lighting very considerably, enabled
INDUSTRY
161
the industry to hold its own while the supply of gas for purposes other than lighting
increased.
The modern gas industry developed during the period between the wars when
increasing competition from electricity had to be met and when changes in
social habits and outlook were taking place. The industry undertook a large-scale
programme of modernization of production and distribution and launched wide¬
spread sales promotion campaigns especially for the numerous uses of gas in the
home. By 1939 the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating instead of a
supplier of lighting.
Organization under Public Ownership
Under the Gas Act, 1948, the gas industry was brought under public ownership
and control on 1st May 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged
to local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. Together they cover the
whole of Great Britain and are charged with the statutory duty to develop and
maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of gas supply to domestic,
industrial and other consumers. The national body is the Gas Council, which is
responsible for advising the Minister of Fuel and Power on questions affecting the
gas industry. It consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman and the 12
chairmen of the Area Boards. It is a co-ordinating council and, inter alia, is
responsible for advising the Minister on questions affecting the gas industry.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and operational
responsibility, are charged inter alia with the responsibility of manufacturing and
distributing gas to consumers. Their powers differ from those of the Electricity
Area Boards, which are limited to the distribution and sale of current, while the
central executive body—the British Electricity Authority—is charged with the
duties of generation and transmission. Each of the Area Gas Boards consists of a
full-time chairman and deputy-chairman, in some cases one full-time member,
and always five or six part-time members including the chairman of the Area
Consultative Council. There is no common pattern of organization; each Board
is fully independent and has devised its own subordinate structure.
A link between the industry and the consuming public was established under the
nationalization scheme by the creation of a Consultative Council in each board area.
These councils consist of not fewer than 20 and not more than 30 members, of
whom between 50 and 75 per cent are chosen from panels of persons nominated by
the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland, as in the case of electricity, the gas supply industry remains
in the hands of a number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-
statutory companies.
Production
In 1953 in Great Britain 27 million tons of coal were carbonized by gas under¬
takings and 26 million tons by coke ovens operated outside the gas industry. About
one quarter of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas undertakings for
general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the ovens or at collieries
or steelworks.
In 1921, 250,300 million cubic feet of gas was manufactured by authorized gas
undertakings or acquired from coke ovens, and the number of consumers was 7 6
million. By 1953, gas manufactured and acquired from coke ovens for distribution
had risen to 564,635 million cubic feet and the number of consumers had risen to
about 12-3 million, an increase of 126 per cent in the volume of gas available and
of about 62 per cent in the number of consumers.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The total number of persons employed in the gas industry in December 1953
was 144 thousand, including 13 thousand women. There has been an increase of
9 thousand in the number of workers since September 1948. Table 25 illustrates
the trends in the manufacture of gas over the last three decades, showing the steady
rise in the manufacture of gas at gasworks and the very rapid increase in the acquisi¬
tion of supplies from coke ovens and other sources.

Domestic Use. While an accurate statistical analysis of the domestic load is not
possible, evidence given before the Ridley Committee (on Fuel and Power Policy),
appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power in 1951, suggested that about 70 per
cent of the domestic load was used for cooking, the remaining 30 per cent being
spread over space heating, water heating and other installations. Most homes in
Britain are now supplied with gas, except in some rural areas where, owing to diffi¬
culties in storage and transmission, gas is not economic. These difficulties have
been overcome to some extent by the use of local high-pressure storage tanks, but
this development is unlikely to grow owing to the steady extension of rural elec¬
tricity supplies. Bottled gas, derived from petroleum, is widely used in rural areas.
Industrial and Commercial Use. Gas is used extensively in industries which require
a simple control of temperature to a fine degree of accuracy. Among such industries
are pottery and certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products.
Industrial use of gas increased greatly during the second world war and reached
103 thousand million cubic feet in 1943. By 1952 industrial consumption had risen
further to 137 thousand million cubic feet.
By-products
With the rapid increase in the volume of gas produced, the problems of the
disposal of substances which were regarded originally as the ‘waste’ products of the
carbonization of coal (notably tar, benzole, sulphur and ammonia) became increas¬
ingly important.
Production of coke at gas works in 1953 was 12,254,000 tons, and at coke ovens
17,481,000 tons. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce over 2f million
tons of crude coal tar and about 100 million gallons of crude benzole a year. These
products, together with those of the sulphur and ammonia type, provide a source
for the manufacture of a long and ever-growing list of essential derivatives which
includes dyestuffs (of which Britain now produces more than 80 per cent of its
requirements), fertilizers, plastics, germicides (the sulphonamides and sulphanila-
mides), insecticides, refrigerants, perfumes, and synthetic yarns.
With further research and development, more especially in the field of organic
chemistry, the production of coal carbonization derivatives is becoming of increas¬
ing importance to the economy of the industry.

The chief objects of capital expenditure since the war have been to overtake
arrears of plant renewal; plans for substantial expansion have had to be postponed.
Under the Gas Act, 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. Borrowings to a total of £235 million had been
authorized up to 30th June 1954. The Gas and Electricity (Borrowing Powers) Act,
1954, extended these borrowing powers to £450 million.
Capital expenditure in 1953 waj £48 million, compared with £46 million in 1952
and £34 million in 1950.
The post-war structure of the industry has already permitted considerable
integration by the linking of undertakings for the transmission of gas, enabling
production to be concentrated in the most efficient units. Progress is also being
made in interconnections for the reception of gas from coke ovens, notably in the
East and West Gas Grids of South Wales.
Supplies of suitable coal to meet a steadily increasing gas consumption are
becoming more difficult to obtain. Investigations into alternative sources of gas are
being actively undertaken by the Gas Council. Residual gases from oil refineries
(butane or propane) are used in installations at Whitland, Carmarthenshire, and at
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
164
Bungay and Framlingham in the Eastern area. Progress has also been made with
the possible use of methane—a gas drained from coal mines. In agreement with
the National Coal Board, Area Gas Boards have agreed to schemes for using
methane at Point of Ayr Colliery in North Wales and at Haig Pit at Whitehaven, in
Northumberland. Plants for the gasification of heavy oil are in operation. Towards
the end of 1953 the Gas Council announced that it would spend £1 million during
the next five years on a survey, to be carried out by an oil prospecting company, to
try to discover natural gas within Britain in commercial quantities, and drilling
operations are in progress in several areas.
The research organization established by the Gas Council consists of a research
committee which advises the Council on policy and sees that it is carried out; and
two research stations, one in London and one in Birmingham. Research is also
carried out on behalf of the Gas Council at Leeds University and by the British
Ceramic Association (an autonomous research association grant-aided by DSIR,
see p. 344). Further, the Council and Area Boards support a number of research
associations, the work of which has a bearing on the gas industry. These include the
Coal Tar Research Association, the British Coal Utilization Research Association
and the National Benzole Association. The underlying aim of the Council’s research
programme is to ‘make the most economic use of the natural resources available to
the nation, whether by improvements in existing processes of gas manufacture, by
seeking new processes or new sources of supply of gas and in the extraction and use
of other products of gas-making’.
During the past two years the North Western Gas Board has been conducting a
series of experiments with the object of accelerating the manufacture of coal gas.
A new process, first thought out in 1917 but not then seriously developed, consists
of injecting gas into the base of a standard vertical retort during carbonization.
Results, still to be confirmed by full-scale operational tests, already suggest that
substantial economies may be obtained both in capital expenditure and in running
costs.
FUEL EFFICIENCY
The Government has for some time sought to promote efficiency in the use of
fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, and has been assisted by various
bodies representative of producers and consumers.
The Coal Utilization Council, consisting of representatives of coal producers,
distributors, coal appliance manufacturers and the Ministry of Fuel and Power,
was formed in 1932 to give information and advice on the best use of solid fuel,
including the choice of installation and operation of solid fuel appliances, to
domestic consumers and retailers of appliances. During the second world war
the reduction in coal production and the demands of war industry made economy
imperative. When the Ministry of Fuel and Power was formed in 1942, an
Industrial Fuel Advisory Service with regional branches was incorporated
within it. In 1943 the Women's Advisory Committee on Solid Fuel, consisting mainly
of representatives of appliance manufacturers, women’s organizations and others
interested in the housewife’s point of view on domestic fuel arrangements, was
formed to advise women on the use of solid fuel for heating and cooking.
Further measures have been taken during the last three years. Under a scheme
introduced in 1952, loans on favourable terms are available from the Exchequer
to industrialists for financing approved fuel-saving schemes. At present these
loans are interest-free for the first two years, repayment may be spread over a
maximum period of twenty years and no security is required. In October 1953 a
non-profit-making company, known as theATational Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service,
INDUSTRY
165
sponsored by the British Productivity Council (see p. 127), was formed to promote
fuel-saving in industry. The new company, which replaced the Industrial Fuel
Advisory Service of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, came into operation on
1 st May 1954* It provides advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users both
directly and through independent consultants and fuel technologists. A survey
into the generation and usage of steam in British industry is being carried out by
the Ministry with a view to effecting large savings in the use of fuel. The electricity
and gas industries, the largest consumers of primary fuel, are succeeding each year
in obtaining more energy from each ton of coal they use by increasing the thermal
efficiency of their plants.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain has a sufficient rainfall to ensure enough water to supply all its domestic
and industrial requirements. Water problems are mainly concerned with abstrac¬
tion, storage, treatment and distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface
sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds
and by river intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits
and boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and
gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of water undertakings of
different kinds. Ministerial responsibility for national water policy rests with the
Ministry of Housing and Local Government in England and Wales, with the
Secretary of State for Scotland in Scotland and with the Ministry of Health and
Local Government in Northern Ireland.
Growth and Development of Water Supplies
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service and then only after long and bitter controversy. It
was largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick and his colleagues, who demon¬
strated the dangers to pure water supply and sanitation brought about by the new
industrialization, that the Public Health Act, 1848, became law. The Act laid down
a common minimum standard of sanitary service and became the foundation of all
subsequent legislation on sanitation. For example, the Sanitary Act of 1866 pre¬
scribed that local authorities should inspect their areas and suppress nuisances.
From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of separate large
water undertakings were set up to provide adequate supplies of pure water to the
expanding urban population and the water supply system developed rapidly in
piecemeal fashion with some overlapping and waste. Over the past eighty years
there have been a number of amalgamations; the outstanding example has been
the Metropolitan Water Board, established in 1902, which is responsible for provid¬
ing an adequate supply of pure water in the London area. Eight separate undertak¬
ings were combined to form the Board, which is probably the largest single water
undertaking in the world, and supplies about 330 million gallons daily to nearly
7 million people in Greater London. The Board consists of 66 part-time members
who are the elected representatives of the various local authorities within the
Board’s area of operations, including one representative each from the Thames and
Lee Conservancies, and a chairman and vice-chairman, chosen by members of the
Board for their experience in water undertakings.
To meet the urgent need for co-ordination and long-term planning, the Ministry
of Health was assisted from 1923 onwards by an Advisory Committee on Water,
and since 1924 the responsible Ministry has encouraged the formation of Regional
Advisory Water Committees for important areas having a common water problem.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
166
The Water Act, 1945, gave the Minister of Health powers to implement national
water policy to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies in
England and Wales. Provision was also made for a Central Advisory Water Com¬
mittee to advise the Government on general questions relating to water. The Act
dealt with the local organization of water supplies and the powers and duties of
local authorities and water undertakings. Local authorities were required to supply
piped wholesome water to every part of their districts where there were houses or
schools, unless it was impracticable to do so at reasonable cost. They were also
required to maintain wells, springs and water mains, and to ensure that supplies
were free from pollution.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts was assisted by an initial grant
of £1 million under the Rural Water Supplies Act, 1934; further grants of up to
£45 million (in England and Wales) were provided under the Rural Water Supplies
and Sewerage Acts, 1944 and 1951.
Since the Water Act was passed, more than 100 smaller water authorities in
England and Wales have been absorbed by larger authorities or by the creation of
joint boards. Notable examples are the North Devon Water Board, which took
over a water company and the undertakings of 10 rural authorities, and the Mid-
Northamptonshire Water Board, which absorbed 13 small undertakings. The
principal object of such amalgamation is the constitution of more efficient units in
the water supply industry.
On the formation of the Ministry of Local Government and Planning in January
1951, the responsibilities of the Minister of Health in regard to water were trans¬
ferred to that Ministry, renamed the Ministry of Housing and Local Government
in November 1951.
The Ministry has completed some 30 surveys of existing water requirements and
supplies covering the whole of England and Wales, which provide a basis for
planning possible future developments.
Present Supplies in England and Wales
In March 1954 in England and Wales there were 893 local authority water
undertakings, 56 joint water boards (including bulk supply boards) and 14 joint
water committees, 104 statutory water companies, 34 non-statutory water com¬
panies, and 6 private proprietors with statutory powers. A considerable number of
private proprietors without statutory powers also provide small supplies. Water
undertakings vary greatly in size; of the statutory undertakings, some 2^ per cent
supply about half the population.
The water storage capacity in England and Wales is rather more than 236,000
million gallons, or enough to supply those countries for more than 100 days.
Statutory water undertakings together supply about 1,750 million gallons a day or
about 40 to 45 gallons per head of the population (including water supplied to
industry). They spend about £22 million a year on capital development, financed
mainly by loans, the interest on which, together with running costs, is paid by the
undertakings from a total annual income of some £50 million. This income is
derived from local water rates or charges levied on domestic consumers calculated
as a percentage of the annual rateable value of their property and from prescribed
charges for meters in the case of most industrial users. In addition to supplies from
water undertakings, large quantities of water are taken by industry from rivers or
underground sources.
Today, piped water supplies reach some 95 per cent of the total population of
England and Wales. More than 70 per cent of persons living in rural areas have
piped water supplies or are within easy reach of water mains.
INDUSTRY
167
The steady growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, and, in so far as such growth involves covering the ground with imper¬
vious material so that water which previously would have percolated through to
underground natural reservoirs is now carried off in drains and rivers, some
diminution in water supplies may result. On the other hand, improved methods of
purification in recent years have resulted in greater use being made of water drawn
from the lower reaches of rivers.
Present Supplies in Scotland and Northern Ireland
Ninety-five per cent of the total population of Scotland is reached by piped
supplies, as compared with 82 per cent in the country areas. Although the water
problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that of England and Wales, the differences
in geography, law and organization have led to special legislation being enacted.
The Water (Scotland) Act, I949> provided for a £20 million grant for rural water
supplies, set up the Scottish Water Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary of
State for Scotland, and made the domestic water rate uniform over the country
area of a county.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of fairly uniform soft water. Gravitation
water systems supply the large towns. The Water Supplies and Sewerage Act
(Northern Ireland), 1945, places certain statutory obligations on local authorities
with regard to water supply, drainage and sewerage, and provides grants towards
the cost of improvements which are made.
River Boards
Under the River Boards Act, 1948, 32 River Boards have been set up to carry
out and co-ordinate the various aspects of river management previously performed
by a large number of separate authorities, including catchment boards responsible
for land drainage, fishery boards and local authorities.
Each River Board covers a River Board Area. The River Board Areas together
comprise the whole of England and Wales, except the Thames and Lee Catchment
areas (which are under the jurisdiction of the Thames and Lee Conservancy
Boards1 respectively), the administrative County of London, and areas adjoining
that county not included in any catchment area.
River Boards are composite bodies representing local government, agricultural
and fishery interests, and most of their expenses are apportioned among the
councils of the counties or county boroughs concerned in them in proportion to the
rateable values of property in the River Board Area.
River management in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not been concentrated
to the same extent.
Inland Water Survey
A survey is being carried out to provide Government Departments, water under¬
takings, industry, agriculture and other water users with information on the yield,
behaviour and quantity of the nation’s water resources. The field work on surface
water is being undertaken mainly by the River Boards under the guidance of
the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries. The other two aspects of the survey, rainfall and underground
1 The Thames and Lee Conservancy Boards are similar in constitution and powers to
the River Boards. Because London draws most of its water supplies from these two rivers,
however, they have long been regulated under powers granted by Acts of Parliament of
purely local application.

water supplies, are the responsibility of the Meteorological Office (see p. 40) and
the Geological Survey and Museum respectively. There are arrangements for
consultation between the interested bodies.
Prevention of River Pollution
A sub-committee to investigate measures for the prevention of river pollution
was set up by the Central Advisory Water Committee in 1949- Its recommendations
were incorporated in the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1951, which revises
and strengthens previous legislation. There is a similar Act for Scotland. It is now
an offence for any person to permit any polluting matter, solid or liquid, to enter a
river. Enforcement of the Act is vested in the River Boards and the Thames and
Lee Conservators.
SOME MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
In terms of production and exports the most important British industries are the
metals and metal-using group (which contributed more than half the total value of
United Kingdom exports in 1953), the textiles group and the chemicals group. This
section gives notes on some of the industries in these broad categories as well as on
some traditional British craft industries and some newer industries which have
started, or greatly increased, their export trade since the second world war.
METALS INDUSTRIES
The metals industries are those producing iron and steel and the various non-
ferrous metals, which are the basic materials of the metal-using group.
Iron and Steel Industry
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and was responsible for the technical development
which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in the second half of the nineteenth
century. Today Britain is the world’s third largest producer (after the United
States and the Soviet Union) and is renowned for the quality of its special and
alloy steels. In 1953 direct exports of steel amounted to 2-2 million tons (in terms
of ingot equivalent), at a value of £141 million, in addition to indirect exports
through the sales of the steel-consuming industries. As will be seen later in this
section, export sales of the vehicles industries (which are the major consumers of
steel) amounted to some £47° million in 1953.
At the beginning of the twentieth century British steel production averaged
about 5 million tons a year and n-2 million tons in the pre-war years 1935 to I938-
Output in 1945 was ii-8 million tons.
Modernization of the industry was interrupted by the war. A post-war develop¬
ment plan was drawn up in 1945 by the British Iron and Steel Federation, the
main trade organization of the industry. This plan, which was generally approved
by the Government in 1946, aimed to modernize steelmaking capacity in Britain
and to increase it to 16 million tons a year by the early 1950s. In fact, the objective
was exceeded with the production of 16'4 million tons in 1952 and 17'6 million
tons in 1953. Work on the greater part of a further development plan to raise
the country’s steel production to at least 20 million tons by 1957 i® well in hand.
Notable projects completed under the first plan include the Abbey Works at
Margam, the tinplate works at Trostre (both in South Wales) and the new sintering
process incorporated in the Seraphim extensions at Scunthorpe, in Lincolnshire,
where the largest blast furnace in Europe was installed in i954*
INDUSTRY
169
About 450,000 people were employed in those industries generally regarded as
iron and steel manufacture at the end of 1953, a figure only slightly greater than
at the end of 1948.
South Wales and the north-east coast of England are the United Kingdom’s
two greatest steel-producing areas, together responsible for an annual production
of well over 7 million tons. South Wales is engaged mainly in the production of
flat products, and is especially noted for its tinplate production. In the north-east
coast area of England production is concentrated on heavy sections and rails, and
plates for the shipbuilding industry. Scotland, with an annual production of over
2 million tons, finds its chief internal markets in the shipbuilding and engineering
industries of the Clyde Valley. Sheffield is known all over the world for its alloy and
special steels.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public supervision
since 1932 when a Government-appointed body, the Import Duties Advisory
Committee, gave special attention to the reorganization of the industry. During the
second world war detailed control was exercised by the Iron and Steel Control of
the Ministry of Supply, and from 1946 to 1949 the industry was supervised by an
Iron and Steel Board responsible to the Minister of Supply. On 15th February
I9SI the greater part of the industry came into public ownership by virtue of the
Iron and Steel Act, 1949- On that day the securities of the eighty major iron and
steel producing companies were transferred from private shareholders to the Iron
and Steel Corporation of Great Britain established under the Act, although the
companies retained their separate identities and managements and the control of
their subsidiaries.
The 1949 Act was repealed by the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, which established
an Iron and Steel Holding and Realization Agency with the duty of returning
these companies to private ownership. By the middle of 1954 considerable progress
had been made with this task. The Act also provided for the establishment of an
Iron and Steel Board to exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel
industry with a view to promoting efficient, economic and adequate supply of iron
and steel products under competitive conditions. The Board was appointed by
the Minister of Supply in June 1953 and includes, in addition to the chairman and
two other full-time members, a number of part-time members drawn from steel
producers, steel consumers and trade unions. The Board has particular powers in
relation to development, the procurement of raw materials and prices. Maximum
prices for most iron and steel products are determined by the Board.
Non-ferrous Metals Industries
Non-ferrous metals industries in Britain contributed direct exports to the value
°f £,9° million in 1953. Apart from a little mining of lead, tin, tungsten and copper,
the British industry consists of factories for smelting, rolling, extrusion, drawing,
casting and fabrication, chiefly of aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, tin, magnesium
and the precious metals. Some of these and other non-ferrous metals, such as
nickel, molybdenum and tungsten, are used in steel alloys, and science is finding
new uses for non-ferrous metals of all kinds which are vital to industries as diverse
as, for example, production of nuclear energy (uranium), jet aircraft engines
(aluminium, columbium, magnesium, titanium), and electronic apparatus
(selenium, tungsten, germanium).
METAL-USING INDUSTRIES
Of the metal-using industries the vehicles group makes the largest contribution to
the export trade (some £470 million in 1953). It employed at the end of 1953 over
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
170
one million people: 209,000 in shipbuilding and repairing, 293,000 in the manufac¬
ture of motor vehicles and cycles, 218,000 in the manufacture and repair of aircraft,
142,000 in the manufacture of parts and accessories for motor vehicles and aircraft,
and 171,000 in the manufacture and repair of locomotives, railway carriages, wagons
and trains.
Motor Vehicles Industry
In size and value the vehicles industries are headed by the motor vehicles
industry, which comprises the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles other
than tractors. Exports in 1953 (including parts) were valued at £222 million. Britain
is the world’s largest exporter of these products, and has been responsible for some
of the latest technical advances, such as the application of the gas turbine engine
to motor car propulsion, for which at least four British manufacturers have patents.
On the production side, some of the new assembly plants in Britain, electrically
controlled and using the minimum of labour, may stand comparison with similar
plants anywhere in the world for efficiency and reliability.
Total production of motor vehicles in Britain rose from 10,500 in 1908 to a peak
of 783,672 in 1950. This total fell slightly in 1951, through steel shortages, and
again in 1952, through restriction in some export markets, but rose again in 1953
to the record level of 834,901, of which half was exported. Production and exports
in all categories of motor vehicles showed further substantial increases in 1954- An
encouraging factor in the last few years has been the increase in exports of cars to
the United States and Canada. In 1953 the total of cars sent to the United States
declined, but that to Canada considerably increased.
The industry is to be found mainly in the Midlands and in London and in south¬
east England, but is represented in most regions. Motor vehicle producers may be
divided into four main groups: (1) the ‘Big Five’, which control between them 12
establishments producing over 9° Per cent of the output of cars and light vehicles;
(2) specialist producers of cars; (3) specialist producers of cars and commercial
vehicles; (4) manufacturers of commercial vehicles excluding the ‘Big Five’ and
specialist producers. The two largest firms in the first category, Austin and Nuffield,
were acquired by a holding company, the British Motor Corporation, in February
1952, with the object of obtaining economies and standardization. This group,
with assets totalling £66 million, is the fourth largest motor manufacturing group
in the world, representing some 35 per cent of British output of cars and commercial
vehicles. Capital expansion plans involving more than £120 million over the next
five years were announced by the leading manufacturers in October 1954.
The principal trade association in the industry is the Society of Motor Manufac¬
turers and Traders (SMMT), founded in 1902, which holds in London a Motor
Exhibition annually and a Commercial Motor Exhibition every two years.
Research is carried out by the Motor Industry Research Association, at Lindley,
Warwickshire, an autonomous body founded in 1946 and partly financed by the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (see p. 344) but mainly by the
industry and the SMMT; and also by DSIR’s Mechanical Engineering Research
Laboratory at East Kilbride, Scotland.
Cycle and Motor Cycle Industry
Exports of motor cycles, motor tricycles and cycles (including parts) made in
Britain earned £34 million in 1953. Exports of pedal cycles and parts alone were
valued at £25 million. The industry making cycles is quite separate from, though
akin to, the motor vehicles industry. Britain is the world’s largest exporter of these
products.
INDUSTRY
171
A Scotsman, McMillan, built the first pedal cycle in 1840. Factory production
began in 1868, when a sewing-machine firm undertook a contract for 100 pedal
cycles. The modern pedal cycle industry is one of the most concentrated in the
country, three large firms being responsible for about two-thirds of the output.
Cycle manufacturers buy some components from specialist component manufac¬
turers, often the same firms which supply the motor vehicles and aircraft industries.
The chief centres of production are at Nottingham and Birmingham. The labour
force is about 20,000, excluding persons employed by specialist component firms.
Output rose from two million cycles in 1935 to four million in 1952; in 1953 it
was over three million.
The trade association of this industry is the British Cycle and Motor Cycle
Manufacturers and Traders Union, which holds an annual show in London,
usually in November.
Aircraft Industry
Aircraft exports, including parts other than tyres, reached a value of £65 million
in I953* British contributions to aeronautical science have been numerous, from
the early nineteenth century, when Sir George Cayley founded the science of aero¬
dynamics, to the twentieth century, when the use of a gas turbine for jet propulsion,
for which Sir Frank Whittle was granted a patent in 1930, came to fruition with
the flight of the first jet-propelled aircraft on 15th May 1941. Since the second
world war, the United Kingdom aircraft industry (which dates from 1905) has
built over 1,000 commercial transport aircraft for operators at home and abroad.
It has concentrated mainly on the development and production of gas turbine
aircraft for civil and military purposes, although a range of piston-engined types is
still produced.
A new private company entitled Air Finance Ltd. (see p. 259) was formed in
September 1953 to assist aircraft manufacturers to promote exports by offering
credit facilities to oversea customers.
The industry employs over 230,000 people compared with 134,219 in 1948,
i-8 million in 1944 (the war-time peak) and 35,890 in 1935.
The representative body of the United Kingdom aircraft industry is the Society
of British Aircraft Constructors, founded in 1916. The annual exhibition and
flying display held by this society at Farnborough is a fixture of international
importance.
The greater part of research on fundamental problems of aerodynamics, struc¬
tures and engines is carried out by the Ministry of Supply. This work is done in
collaboration with the industry and results are made known to manufacturers, who
are in close and constant touch with the Ministry’s establishments. The actual
design, construction and initial testing of aircraft are, however, carried out by the
manufacturer. British technical achievements recently disclosed include the by-pass
type of engine (the first distinct step forward in the evolution of the aircraft gas
turbine engine), the delta and aero-isoclinic wing shapes, and the first experimental
machine to be capable of vertical take-off from a normal horizontal position.
Shipbuilding
Ships built in British yards and exported to other countries in 1953 were valued
at £40 million, compared with £36 million in 1952.
Britain has for centuries been one of the most important shipbuilding countries.
Modern shipbuilding dates from the middle of the nineteenth century, when the
iron and steam-driven vessel replaced the earlier sailing ship. Britain led the way
in the substitution of steel for iron and in the development of the steam turbine,
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
172
and within the last few years has produced the first ships to be powered by gas
turbines. Between 1890 and 1913 Britain produced more than half the world s new
tonnage, and in 1920 she launched over two million tons, still the peace-time
record for the industry. The problem of surplus capacity and periodic heavy
unemployment appeared in all shipbuilding countries during the inter-war years.
During the second world war the industry was fully occupied in building and
repairing warships and merchant ships of all kinds, and a high level of activity in
the building and repair of merchant ships has continued since 1945.
Shipbuilding is mainly an assembly trade, and Britain’s economy is well equipped
to meet this demand, with a highly developed iron and steel industry to provide
plates, sections and angles, a modern marine engineering industry, and a widely
diversified pattern of general industry to supply the numerous components that go
to the making of a ship.
Well over three-quarters of the tonnage of ships built in the United Kingdom is
produced in four areas:
(1) On the River Clyde in Scotland (where the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth
were built in the inter-war years).
(2) On the north-east coast of England—along the lower reaches of the Rivers
Tyne, Wear and Tees, and at West Hartlepool.
(3) On the north-west coast of England—on the River Mersey and at Barrow-in-
Furness.
(4) At Belfast, in Northern Ireland, where the largest individual shipyard is
situated, and where the Southern Cross, a passenger liner of revolutionary
design, was launched in 1954.
In each of these areas there is capacity for building warships and all types of
merchant ships from large passenger liners and tankers to small sea-going ships
such as coasters and cross-Channel steamers. Ships are also built in the Southampton
area, in the Isle of Wight, and along the estuary of the Rivers Forth and Tay, while
numerous places along the coast build fishing vessels, yachts, harbour craft and
barges.
Repair yards and dry docks are situated in all the great ports and there are
important repair facilities in all the shipbuilding areas.
There are many firms engaged in shipbuilding, although nearly half the output
of new ships is concentrated in the hands of about a dozen.
In the years 1946 to 1948 British shipyards launched nearly half the world’s total
new tonnage. Since then, with the recovery of the shipbuilding industries in
Germany and Japan and the rebuilding of shipyards in some European countries
after their destruction in the war, the British shipyards have built a rather smaller
proportion of world tonnage, though total output from the shipyards has been
fully maintained. The construction of tankers still predominates in the British
yards, 55 per cent of the tonnage under construction at the end of 1953 being
tankers.
In mid-1954 there were about 213,000 employees in the shipbuilding and repair¬
ing industries, including those employed in naval dockyards.

Britain was the first country to develop the locomotive railway and British
engineers pioneered railway development in all parts of the world.
Locomotive production in Britain has come to be divided into two separate

173
sections: one of these comprises the locomotive works of the main British Railways,
and is engaged in building and repairing locomotives and rolling-stock for their
use, the other consists of private firms providing locomotives for all purposes, but
mainly for export.
The first section was taken over from the main railway companies of Great
Britain by the British Transport Commission, when rail transport was nationalized.
Locomotive building and repairing by British Railways is carried on in such
railway centres as Crewe, Swindon, Doncaster, Darlington, Derby, Eastleigh and
Ashford, and in a number of other construction and repairing shops. In 1953 some
38,000 British Railways staff were employed on construction and repairing in loco¬
motive workshops, and another 42,000 in carriage and wagon workshops.
The second section of the industry comprises a number of firms which make
steam, electric, and all forms of diesel locomotives as part of their other engineering
activities. These firms employ about 60,000 workers but not more than one-third
are employed in locomotive building. Of this third, about 14,000 are engaged in the
production of steam locomotives, mainly in a few large firms in south-east
Lancashire and the west of Scotland, and, on a smaller scale, on the north-east
coast of England and in the West Riding of Yorkshire.
Table 27 shows the production of locomotives by British Railways workshops
and private firms during 1953 analysed according to type of locomotive and its
destination.

During the same period 7 electric locomotives were also produced for main line
railways in the United Kingdom, as well as a considerable number for export.
The Electrical Engineering Industry
The electrical engineering industry, using that term to cover the manufacture of
electrical and allied machinery, electronic apparatus (see p. 186), domestic and
commercial appliances, insulating materials, cables and wires and electric loco¬
motives and vehicles, has been, during the last few years, one of the largest export
groups, with exports totalling £179 million in 1953. The industry in its present
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
174
form is not much more than fifty years old. Output in 1953 was valued at £75°
million compared with £14 million in i9°7 and j£310 rnillion in 1946. Some
600,000 people were employed in the industry in all its branches in 1953-
Machinery Industry
Machinery in one word embraces a vast range of industries including agricultural
machinery (see p. 181), ball and roller bearings, boilers, motors, excavators,
mechanical handling equipment, furnace plant, gas and chemical machinery,
machine tools, oil refining plant (see p. 183), office machinery (see p. 183), packag¬
ing machinery, prime movers, pumps, sewing machines, textile machinery, and
electrical machinery (also included under electrical engineering above). Exports of
this whole group in 1953 totalled in value j£4°5 million, compared with £422
million in 1952, £363 million in 1951 and £318 million in 1950.
Textile Machinery
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries is the textile
machinery industry which developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. The industry
now gives employment to about 83,000 people and comprises some 600 firms
making every kind of machine and accessory for processing all types of natural
and synthetic fibres. It enjoys a world-wide reputation, not only for the high
quality of its products but also because it can offer a complete and modern range
of equipment consisting of: spinning machinery, including machinery for all
the preparatory processes; winding machinery and machinery for other processes
prior to weaving; weaving machinery; knitting, hosiery and lace machinery,
printing, dyeing and other finishing machinery; bast and leaf fibre machinery, of
which the United Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest supplier; and all types
of mill stores and textile machinery accessories. In 1953 exports were valued at
over £40 million.
To assist the efforts of the home mills to maintain their pre-eminence in world
textile production, and to keep its own place as the world s traditional supplier of
textile machinery, the industry is spending more and more of its resources and
time on research into the structure and peculiarities of various fibres and into new
and improved methods of processing, and is developing machines capable of
producing more efficiently yarns and fabrics of higher quality. For example, the
new ‘Autoleveller’, for worsted roving preparation, claimed to be one of the most
important developments in the wool textile industry for 100 years, was in full-scale
production in September 1954- The research laboratories and design departments
of machinery makers are also energetically and successfully seeking the solution of
new problems arising from the introduction of the synthetic fibres, such as nylon,
‘Terylene’ and ‘Ardil’ (see pp. 176-7)-
TEXTILE INDUSTRIES
The value of exports in the textiles and clothing group as a whole, including
manufactures of wool, cotton, linen, jute, silk, rayon and synthetic fibres, lace,
hosiery, woven apparel and carpets, amounted in 1953 to £3^3i million, or 15 per
cent of total United Kingdom exports. About million people were employed in
these industries in June 1953, including 162,000 in cotton spinning and doubling,
122,000 in cotton weaving, etc., 210,000 in the wool textile industry, 88,000 in
rayon and nylon production and weaving and silk, 124,000 in hosiery and other
knitted goods, 92,000 in textile finishing, etc., 164,000 in other textiles, and 499,000
in clothing (excluding footwear).
INDUSTRY

The Wool Industry
The wool textile industry is the most ancient of Britain’s staple industries and
has been an important source of wealth since medieval times. There are two main
branches—woollen and worsted. Over 80 per cent of woollens and over 90 per cent
of worsteds are made in Yorkshire. Scotland and the West of England have retained
their importance as specialized producers of high-quality woollen cloth. The
woollen side of the industry is normally organized on a vertical basis, with each firm
undertaking the full process of manufacture from raw material to finished product,
but for a variety of reasons the worsted industry is mainly organized horizontally-
combing, spinning and weaving being done by separate firms. Small firms employ¬
ing fewer than 300 workers predominate in the industry. Output reached a post¬
war peak at the end of 1950. There was a downward trend for most of 1951 and
recession reflecting a world-wide recession in textile trade—became marked in
the last quarter of that year. The first half of 1952 was a period of much reduced
activity, but production recovered thereafter.
I953 production showed a marked improvement over 1952. It was in general
at about the same level as in 1951, but below that of 1950.
The wool industry remains one of Britain’s leading export industries; the total
value of exports of woollen and worsted yarns and manufactures in 1953 was
£139-8 million, or over 5 per cent of United Kingdom exports. After the tourist
trade, vehicles and machinery, the wool industry is Britain’s best dollar earner;
exports of wool manufactures to the United States and Canada were valued at
£36-6 million in 1953. British tops are used by worsted spinners in all parts of the
world.
Research is carried on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association,
which is financed partly by a grant from the Department of Scientific and Industrial
Research and partly by a statutory levy on the industry.
The Cotton Industry
Spinning and weaving of cotton for the making of fustian with a cotton weft and
linen warp began to assume importance in the United Kingdom in the sixteenth
century; but it was the invention of mechanical spinning and weaving in the
second half of the eighteenth century that led to cotton becoming Britain’s chief
consumer-goods industry and cotton piece-goods its largest export.
In the twentieth century increasing foreign competition and the tendency of
many countries, notably India, to set up their own textile industry cut progressively
into British markets. During the second world war numbers of mills were closed
and, though many have since been brought back into production, the industry still
employs only about two-thirds as many workers as in 1937. It remains, however,
one of Britain’s largest consumer-goods industries, being the principal source of
the clothing worn in Britain and playing an important part in the export trade.
Since the war a vigorous drive for quality and efficiency has been pressed forward
by the industry with support and assistance from the Government. Important in
this drive are the Cotton Board, a statutory body with the constitution and powers
of a Development Council, and the British Cotton Industry Research Association
(Shirley Institute), founded in 1919 for promoting scientific and technical research
in connection with cotton and its utilization. The industry now uses a considerable
and increasing amount of rayon as well as cotton, and its dependence on imported
raw material has thus been reduced.
Production rose steadily from 1945 until the end of 1951, when the industry
began to feel the effects of the world textile recession. It did not begin to recover
until the second half of 1952; and in 1953 it was still well below the 1951 post-war
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
176
peak figure, which was itself below the 1937 level, but was making steady progress
towards recovery.
There were about 171,000 persons employed in the spinning and doubling section
of the industry in December 1953, and 125,000 in weaving. In addition the great
majority of 54,000 persons recorded as employed in the weaving of rayon, synthetic
fibres and silk, were in mills within the Cotton Board’s sphere. About two-thirds of
the workers in the industry are women.
Despite the contraction of the industry between 1914 and 1945 and the recession
in 1952, cotton remains a leading export industry. In 1953 exports of cotton yarn
and manufactures were valued at £133 million, or about 5 per cent of United
Kingdom exports, and exports of rayon, synthetic fibres and woven fabrics
amounted to £28 million. Most of the industry is located in south and east
Lancashire, Manchester occupying a special position as its commercial centre.
Other Textiles
Linen has been made in Britain for more than a thousand years and it is believed
that the art of linen weaving was already being practised during the seventh
century. Today it is an industry of small firms, chiefly in Northern Ireland (the
greatest linen manufacturing region in the world). The principal raw material of
the industry is flax, which is mainly imported (the chief supplier is Belgium), but
in England and Scotland particularly a certain amount of soft hemp and jute is
used. In Scotland the industry is concentrated in the eastern part of the country
and specializes in the production of coarse linens and light canvas, probably
because of its association with jute and hemp. Technical problems are investigated
by the Research Institute of the Linen Industry Research Association, formed in
1919. Exports in 1953 were valued at £21 million, the United States being the chief
market.
Jute, most of which comes from India and Pakistan, is the raw material for a
considerable industry centred in Dundee. Jute cloth is used for sacks and bags,
tarpaulins and backing for linoleum; yarns are sold for carpet backing and for
ropemaking. Exports other than cordage were valued at nearly £2 million in 1953;
the Commonwealth and United States were the chief markets.
Silk goods to the value of £1 million were exported to many markets in 1953.
Raw silk is supplied mainly from Japan and Italy.
Rayon is produced from cellulose, either in the form of wood pulp or cotton
Enters. Its early development took place to a large extent in Britain. Production is
spread throughout the Midlands and Lancashire, with outposts in other areas.
There are nine companies engaged in the production of rayon, five producing only
viscose, three producing only acetate, and one both viscose and acetate. In 1953
viscose rayon accounted for 67 per cent of filament yam production, including yarn
for industrial purposes, but 82 per cent of all rayon produced (i.e. including staple
fibre) was of the viscose type. Rayon, besides being used for textile purposes (where
it is sometimes used alone but more usually in blend with natural fibres) is being
used increasingly for industrial purposes (e.g., for the manufacture of tyre cord)
and in 1953 over 28 per cent of all rayon produced was of the industrial type.
Other Man-made Fibres
Nylon is produced from a combination of chemical substances, most of which
are obtained from indigenous raw materials. It was discovered in the United
States and first used in Britain in the second world war for parachutes. It is now
used for general textile and industrial purposes. Production is expected to reach
an annual rate of 25 million lb. by the end of 1954, and 30 million lb. before the
INDUSTRY
177
end of 1955. A new plant is now being built and is expected to come into produc¬
tion in the closing months of 1955.
‘Terylene’, a product of research in the laboratories of the Calico Printers’
Association, Manchester, is at present being made in Britain by Imperial Chemical
Industries Ltd. (ICI) in a pilot scale plant, but a £10 million plant is under con¬
struction with an annual capacity of over 11 million lb. scheduled for operation in
I95S> and a further similar sum is to be spent on doubling the capacity of this new
plant. ICI is also setting up a plant in Canada, and the fibre has been made for
some years under licence in the United States under the name ‘Dacron’. It is also
to be made under licence in France, the German Federal Republic, Italy and the
Netherlands.
'Ardir and ‘Fibrolane’ are protein fibres with wool-like properties. ‘Ardil’ was
evolved in the Scottish laboratories of ICI Ltd. Experimental quantities were first
produced in 1938 and a plant with a capacity of 10,000 tons a year, started in 1949,
is now in production. ‘Fibrolane’ is manufactured in commercial quantities by
Courtaulds, Ltd.
At the end of 1953, about 37,000 people were employed in the production of
rayon and other man-made continuous filament yam and staple fibre, and direct
exports of these goods for the year totalled £11 million. A considerably larger
number of people were employed in the production of spun yarns and the weaving
and knitting of rayon, nylon and similar goods, exports of which totalled about
£40 million in 1953.
Since the advent of rayon in its various forms and, more recently, of the new
synthetic fibres, British textile manufacturers have been developing a number of
ways of blending these with natural fibres. By this means they can produce
economically fabrics and garments with attractive and useful new combinations of
texture, colour, and finish, and with moisture-absorbent, hard-wearing and crease-
resisting properties.
CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES
Broadly, the chemical industries include the manufacture of such products as
acids, alcohols, alkalis, paints, dyestuffs, plastics and pharmaceuticals. The
industry employs about half a million people, contributes about 3 per cent of the
total national output of goods and services, and in 1953 exported goods valued at
£130 million, or 5 per cent of United Kingdom exports. British pioneers made
great contributions to the science of chemistry, as the names of Robert Boyle,
Joseph Priestley, Michael Faraday and John Dalton testify. Contemporary British
chemists who maintain the tradition include Sir Alexander Fleming (discoverer
of penicillin), Sir Robert Robinson (who has done outstanding work on vitamins
and hormones) and Doctor A. J. P. Martin and Doctor R. M. Synge (who were
awarded the Nobel prize in 1952 for their work in developing chromatography, a
method of separating chemical substances).
Heavy Chemicals and Dyestuffs
In the heavy chemicals section sulphuric acid is being made increasingly from
anhydrite (calcium sulphate), of which the United Kingdom has immense deposits.
More than a thousand different dyestuffs are now available, and the level of invest¬
ment in research and development is reflected in the continuing success of the
British dyestuffs industry. In 1948 (the last year for which these figures have yet
been published) total sales of finished dyestuffs amounted to approximately £18-5
million, and in that year direct exports were worth Cy-J million. In the course of
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
178
I953> the dyestuffs industry, in common with most others, was recovering from
the effects of the setbacks received in 1952, and exports of finished dyestuffs
reached a total of £8-3 million.
Petroleum Chemicals
The large-scale manufacture of organic chemicals from petroleum in Britain has
developed since the second world war. Previously they were either imported or
made from coal, coal tar, molasses and calcium carbide. Some £40 million are
invested in the five major petroleum chemicals plants built over this period. The
principal products include gases, e.g., ethylene and propylene from which are
made industrial alcohol, solvents and other chemicals and intermediate products
used in plastics (see below), synthetic fibres (see pp. 176-7), leather finishing, paint
and synthetic detergents.
Synthetic Detergents possess qualities associated with soap but are in addition
free from scum formation and are able to break up and remove grease. Estimated
United Kingdom production of synthetic detergents rose from 12,000 tons in 1946
to over 150,000 tons in 1953, of which 18,763 tons were exported.
Fertilizers
The British scientists Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert contributed to the
evolution of fertilizers, which now constitute a major branch of the chemical
industry. Scientific knowledge has increased rapidly in recent years and the research
carried on in the United Kingdom at Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, and the Macaulay
Institute at Aberdeen is of world-wide importance. Production in 1952-53 (July to
June) of phosphatic fertilizers totalled 362,000 tons of plant food, of nitrogenous
fertilizers 308,000 tons of plant food, and of compound fertilizers over if million tons.
Pesticides
Pesticides have been used for hundreds of years but it was not until about 1920
that they were based on accurate scientific methods. Important discoveries in
Britain in the last decade have led to major developments in the production of
selective weed killers, e.g., methyl chloro phenoxy acetic acid (MCPA) and insecti¬
cides based on benzine hexachloride (BHC).
Exports of disinfectants and insecticides rose in value from £880,000 in 1939
to £4^ million in 1953.
Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceuticals provided exports valued at £31 million in 1953 compared with
£3 million in 1938. The present annual rate of United Kingdom output is valued
at some £120 million. About three-quarters of the pharmaceutical products sold
today have been introduced within the last twenty years, including sulphonamides,
antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), hormones, anti-malarial drugs, liver extracts, anti¬
histamines and anti-tubercular drugs.
Plastics
Plastics are man-made materials, generally of organic and synthetic origin,
which at some time in their manufacture are in a plastic (i.e. flowing) condition and
thus capable of being shaped under heat and pressure. The first plastic, ‘Parkesine’,
was produced in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes; modern plastics originating
in Britain include ‘Perspex’ and ‘Polythene’. A class of plastics known as ‘silicones’,
with valuable heat-resisting and other properties, which were discovered by
Professor Kipping at Nottingham and developed in the United States, are now
being made in Britain in a new factory at Barry in Glamorganshire, South Wales,
INDUSTRY
170
which was opened in November 1954. The plastics industry falls into two separate
and self-contained groups. The first, the production of plastic materials, falls within
the chemical industry, but the fabricating side which uses those materials does not.
Overall production of plastic materials has probably increased about six times
since 1939. Exports reached a value of over £16 million in 1951 and were a little
over £16 million in 1953.
TRADITIONAL CRAFT INDUSTRIES
T here are a number of industries noted for the quality of their traditional
craftsmanship which make an important contribution to Britain’s export trade.
Pottery
The pottery industry is one of Britain’s most successful dollar earners, and is
almost completely independent of oversea raw materials. The manufacture of high-
grade pottery requires china clay found in Cornwall and Devon, ball clay from
Devon and Dorset, and china stone from Cornwall. Suitable clays are found in
Staffordshire for items such as drainpipes, chimney-pots and roofing tiles.
Of the £29 million worth of domestic pottery produced in the peak year, 1952,
£15 million worth was exported. The chief customers for china (excluding electrical
porcelain) were Canada, the United States and Australia, and for earthenware
Canada, Australia, the United States and the Union of South Africa.
Between 75 and 80 per cent of the industry is concentrated in the area of Stoke-
on-Trent in Staffordshire, comprising the six towns of Stoke, Burslem, Tunstall,
Hanley, Fenton and Longton; the pottery industry employs about 35 per cent of
the whole working population of the area, while a large proportion of the rest is
employed in allied industries. Other centres include Worcester, Derby, Bristol,
and Poole (in Dorset). The industry is divided into distinct sections. The largest
section produces domestic pottery, subdivided into china, earthenware, stoneware,
and Jet and Rockingham used mainly for tea and coffee-pots. The other main
sections produce respectively glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical porcelain
(e.g., insulators and fittings). Excluding the smaller concerns there are about 300
firms, of which about 200 make domestic pottery. The labour force is nearly 80,000
including over 45,000 women.
Since the second world war steps have been taken to increase output per man¬
hour. Improved factory layout, standardization and semi-automatic and fully
automatic ‘making’ machines have been introduced. Perhaps the greatest advance
has been the installation of gas and electric tunnel kilns, through which trolleys,
stacked with clay shapes, pass continuously.
The modern industry benefits from a tradition of good design and craftsmanship,
made world-famous by a long line of great British potters, which is the basis of the
large oversea and domestic demand for its products. Among the famous makes of
British pottery are: Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton,
Royal Crown Derby and Coalport.
Research is carried out by the British Ceramic Research Association, financed
partly by the industry and partly by the Government through the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research. The Association’s new laboratories at Penkhull,
Stoke-on-Trent, were opened in 1951.
Scientific Instruments
Scientific instruments were made commercially in Britain at the beginning of the
seventeenth century and probably earlier. At that time navigational aids, such as
compasses, and microscopes (mainly for medical purposes) were made.
l8o BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The industry increased in size during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
but in 1914 it was still small; it manufactured a variety of optical, mechanical and
electrical instruments for laboratory and industrial uses. The first world war proved
that its products were of prime importance to the war effort and when peace came
it expanded under the protection afforded by special tariffs.
During the second world war the industry expanded again very substantially to
meet defence needs. Since 1945 its production has further increased to meet the
pent-up demands from home and overseas for instruments for use in research and
in industry, where their extended use has become recognized as essential to effi¬
ciency. Some 87,000 people, mostly skilled craftsmen, are now employed. In 1953
goods of a wide variety, including photographic, cinematographic and commercial
types of instruments and apparatus, to the value of approximately £17 million were
exported directly, excluding indirect exports of instruments as part of plant and
equipment.
Every two years the industry holds an exhibition of instruments in commercial
production, instruments under development being the subject of an annual
exhibition held by the Physical Society.
Jewellery, Gold and Silver Ware
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware is an industry in which British
craftsmen are heirs to a great tradition. Exports in 1953 were valued at over £5
million. Of the firms producing in 1950, 735 were in Birmingham, 610 in the
London area, 194 in Sheffield and 135 in the southern counties. A Design and Re¬
search Centre for the gold, silver and jewellery industries was incorporated in 1951.
The quality of the metal in gold and silver wares made or sold in the United
Kingdom is guaranteed by a ‘hall-mark’. The law requires that gold and silver
plate shall not be sold until it has been hall-marked at one of the Assay Offices.
These are in London, Birmingham, Chester, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The importance of maintaining definite standards of fineness for wares of gold
and silver has always been recognized and the Goldsmiths’ Company in London has
carried out the assay and hall-marking of such wares since 1327 when Edward III
gave the Company its first charter.
Whisky
Whisky is one of the United Kingdom’s largest individual dollar earners. Exports
in 1953 were valued at £21'! million; over half of these exports went to the United
States. The earliest mention of Scotch whisky was in the fifteenth century, and in
the following years domestic distillation became very common. During the
eighteenth century illicit whisky making was practised frequently in remote places.
The world-wide popularity of Scotch whisky may be said to date from the end of
the nineteenth century when blending became general. Before that time distilleries
either bottled their own whisky or blended it with that of other distilleries. ‘Single’
whiskies are still produced for local consumption on a small scale, but modern
whiskies are blends of twenty or more different kinds, some made from malted
barley and others from other grains.
The Leather Industry
The leather (tanning and dressing) industry in Britain is one of the largest in the
world, employing over 30,000 workers and producing a gross output valued at over
£109 million in 1950. Despite the growing use of rubber, and of plastics and other
synthetic materials in clothing, footwear and personal articles, leather possesses
intrinsic qualities which enable it to hold its own. Exports of leather and leather
INDUSTRY
iSl
manufactures, excluding footwear, in 1953 totalled £13-8 million in value. The
British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association, costing about £50,000 a
year, has, according to a survey conducted by the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research, saved the industry some £305,000 a year. The boot and shoe
industry is one of the main users of leather and employs over 100,000 workers.
Gross output was valued at £i43'7 million in 1950 and exports of footwear made
preponderantly of leather in 1953 totalled over £12 million in value. The British
Boot, Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association encourages the application of
science and mechanization in an industry based upon traditional craft. The bulk of
the Association s work is now carried on in new laboratories at its headquarters at
Kettering, Northamptonshire.
NEW AND EXPANDING EXPORT INDUSTRIES
An important feature in the expansion of United Kingdom exports since the
second world war has been the development of new types of commodities, meeting
new and growing needs. In many cases, the industries making them are based on
inventions or discoveries made during or after the war; in others, the basic research
had been done before the war but production on a commercial scale was not under¬
taken until later. The development of gas turbine aircraft, radar and penicillin are
well-known examples of these new industries.
In addition, there are other commodities which, while produced in Britain
before the war, were then exported on a very small scale indeed, but which have
developed into important exports.
Finally, there is a group of export industries which, though important exporters
even before the war, have expanded exceptionally rapidly since then. Their products
are not, strictly speaking, new exports, but their importance in the growth of the
United Kingdom export trade since the end of the war is of no less significance
than exports based on new inventions or new techniques.
All these growing points of the economy have required a great deal of research,
capital development and skilled manpower for their successful development. Their
rapid growth and their success in the export trade illustrate the way in which the
United Kingdom economy has been adapting itself to the changing pattern of
world demand.
Tables 28 to 31 show the kinds of products included in these categories and their
increasing contribution to total exports; notes follow on some of the industries which
make them, in so far as these have not been specifically mentioned in the previous
sections.
The Agricultural Machinery Industry
The agricultural machinery industry has grown to be one of the largest in
Britain, employing 40,^00 people with an annual output valued at over £100
million. In 1953 it produced among other implements 136,808 tractors, 36,677
mouldboard ploughs, 8,203 disc harrows, 15,860 mowers, 4,757 combine
harvesters, and 10,882 milking machines. Britain, where production dates virtually
from 1933 when the English Ford Company produced 2,788 tractors, now has the
largest annual output of tractors in Europe and the second largest in the world,
exports the greatest proportion of its output and is the second largest exporter in
the world. Exports of agricultural tractors in 1953 were valued at £37 million
compared with £28 million in 1950. Important markets are Australia, New
Zealand, Turkey, Sweden and Denmark. Exports of other agricultural machinery
were valued at £12^ million in 1953 compared with £9! million in 1950.

The Office Equipment Industry
The office equipment industry is now second in size only to that of the United
States and provides an example of remarkable expansion since the second world
war. The value of its output is now over £40 million a year compared with about
£2 million in 1939, and its exports of office machinery alone were valued at nearly
£11 million in 1953, of which nearly £3 million went to North American dollar
markets.
The Petroleum Refining Industry
This industry, in which capital of some £190 million has been invested since
1947, provided exports of refined petroleum products valued at over £71 million
in 1953 compared with £52 million in 1952 and £12-8 million in 1950. At the
same time imports of refined products fell from £140-9 million in 1951 to £90-4
million in 1953.
The Petroleum Equipment Industry
Exports of specialized petroleum equipment were extremely small before the
second world war. The substantial growth in Britain’s post-war export trade in
petroleum equipment is a reflection of the remarkable expansion in the oil industry
throughout the world. According to statistics compiled by the Oil Companies
Materials Secretariat and released by the Council of British Manufacturers of
Petroleum Equipment, British firms received orders for oil equipment valued at
over £67 million during 1953. A large but unspecified part of these orders (which
amounted to less than those received in 1952, valued at £90 million, chiefly because
of the completion of major projects within Britain during 1953) was for use
overseas.

INDUSTRY
185
The Prefabricated Buildings Industry
The British prefabricated buildings industry, based on long experience dating
back in various forms to before 1830, has contributed to solving the problem of
housing shortage not only in Britain but in many other countries of the world.
Exports of prefabricated buildings increased in value from £2‘8 million in 1950 to
nearly £7 rnillion in 1952, when they were sent to over fifty different countries,
including Canada and some other dollar countries. In 1953 exports were valued at
£3-8 million.
Radioactive Isotopes
Britain now produces at least as great a quantity and range of radio-isotopes as
any other country. Sales of radioactive materials are expected to reach a record
value of more than £400,000 in 1954, about one-third of which will represent
exports. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell exported
radio-isotopes direct to 38 countries, and the Radiochemical Centre at Amersham
to 36. France received the largest number of consignments sent abroad from
Harwell (983), followed by Sweden (532), German Federal Republic (411),
Belgium (259) and Switzerland (258); 26 consignments were made to the United
States. Owing to the growing urgency of demands from different countries the
British Overseas Airways Corporation has converted a fleet of Argonauts to carry
the isotopes in their wing-tips. This method reduces the cost of transport by over
60 per cent by cutting out the cost of heavy lead containers. Radioactive isotopes
are used mainly for medical purposes, but also increasingly in scientific research
and in industry. At the Isotope School at Harwell, started in April 1951 to impart
knowledge of isotope production and uses, one-third of the graduate students come
from overseas.
The Refrigeration Industry
This industry falls broadly into three classes—domestic, commercial and
industrial. It has made remarkable strides since the end of the second world war.
Although before the war production of commercial and industrial refrigeration
machinery was well established, domestic refrigeration production, now large, was
then quite small.
The 200 firms engaged in the industry employ some 12,000 workers and produce
annually goods worth nearly £27 million (nearly ten times the value of production
in 1935), of which about £13 million worth is exported. A full range of refrigeration
machinery and equipment is available.
Contractors’ Plant
Production in the United Kingdom before the war was mainly concerned with
small excavators, concrete mixing machinery and road surfacing plant, including
road rollers. But now many new machines, especially for earth-moving, are in
production. Examples are industrial crawler tractors, motor graders, scrapers,
trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, rippers and rooters.
Whereas output in 1935 was valued at only £2 million, in 1953 it reached nearly
£48 million, of which nearly £18 million was exported.
Recent developments in the manufacture of the heaviest types of crawler tractors,
rear and bottom dumpers, motor scrapers, soil stabilizers and mobile crushers will
ensure the continued expansion of this industry.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
186
The Electronics Industry
British engineers invented radar and pioneered the first public television trans¬
mission, and Britain now has the largest electronics industry outside the United
States. The industry has grown enormously in the past fifteen years. It employs
about 125,000 people, and the value of its annual production is some £135 million,
of which some £26 million (including separate components) was exported in i953>
compared with less than £2 million in 1938. Only 40 per cent of this production
is of sound radio and television receiving sets ; the remainder is of such important
products as military equipment, sound radio and television transmitters, electronic
computers, underwater television apparatus, communications equipment, naviga¬
tional aids and industrial equipment.
VI. TRANSPORT
AND COMMUNICATIONS
SHIPPING
Twenty per cent of the world’s shipping tonnage of 100 gross tons and over is
registered in the United Kingdom, which has the largest merchant navy in active
employment. A greater tonnage—26 million—is registered in the United States but
over half of this is in the Reserve Fleet. United Kingdom ships carry probably
over one-third of the world’s international sea-borne traffic in passengers and goods,
and shipping makes the largest single contribution to the United Kingdom’s net
invisible earnings of foreign exchange: £122 million out of a total of £320 million
in 1953. This £122 million excludes earnings of tankers and includes payments by
foreign ships in British ports. An inquiry conducted by the General Council of
British Shipping which takes account of these two factors estimated net foreign
exchange earnings by British shipping at £221 million in 1952.
THE MERCHANT FLEET
As at 30th June 1953, a total of 18*7 million gross tons was registered in the
United Kingdom. Excluding river craft, vessels not ordinarily carrying passengers
or cargo such as fishing vessels, tugs and cable ships, Admiralty vessels (about
375,000 gross tons, mainly tankers) and vessels registered in the United Kingdom
but owned abroad, the gross tonnage was 16 million. These 16 million gross tons,
referred to as the United Kingdom trading fleet, are analysed by type, number
and average age in Table 32.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Two important trends in recent years have been the growth of tanker tonnage,
to meet increased demands for oil, and the fall in coal-fired tonnage.
World tanker tonnage (500 gross tons and over) has increased from million
gross tons in 1939 to over 22 million gross tons in 1953, an increase of 90 per cent
compared with an increase of only about 28 per cent in the world dry cargo
tonnage. Including Admiralty and other tankers, the United Kingdom accounts
for 4-6 million gross tons or 21 per cent of the world’s total tanker tonnage.
Propulsion
The amount of coal-fired tonnage in the United Kingdom trading fleet has
fallen in recent years to less than ii million tons. This is only 7^ per cent of the
total, while of foreign-going tonnage only 4^ per cent is coal-fired. Oil has taken the
place of coal in steamships, while the steam engine is itself giving way to the
diesel engine. In 1953, of 220 merchant ships launched in the United Kingdom,
85 (521,918 gross tons) were steamships and 135 (795,545 gross tons) were motor
ships. The latest development is the investigation being made into the use of gas
turbines in ships. In March 1952 the first crossing of the Atlantic using this form
of propulsion was made by the tanker Amis.
Size Distribution
As to the size of foreign-going trading tonnage, about 52 per cent of tonnage
of liners—passenger and cargo—are in the 6,000-10,000 ton group, and over 68
per cent in the size group 6,000-15,000 tons. Tankers are predominantly in the
8,000-15,000 ton group. Tramps are under 8,000 tons and mainly over 5,000.
Total tramp tonnage has fallen by one million since 1935.
There are four ships of 30,000 tons and over. These are the Queen Elizabeth
(83,000 tons), the Queen Mary (81,000 tons), the Mauretania (35,667 tons), and
the Caronia (34,000 tons). Of ships built since the war, the largest amount of
tonnage falls in the size group 10,000-15,000 tons, the group covering the bulk of
tanker tonnage. Of total launchings in 1953, 7 ships exceeded 20,000 tons, 4 were
between 15,000 and 20,000 tons, 52 between 10,000 and 15,000 tons, 12 between
8,000 and 10,000 tons, and 40 between 4,000 and 8,000 tons. The 7 ships exceeding
20,000 tons were passenger liners or tankers and they included: ss. Orsova (28,250
tons); ss. Arcadia (28,000 tons); ss. Melika (22,000 tons); ss. British Merchant
(21,000 tons); and ss. British Engineer (20,960 tons), the last three being tankers.
There is, indeed, a trend in the direction of tankers larger than 15,000 tons. In the
year 1953 also the Royal steam yacht Britannia of 5,769 tons was launched.
Specialized Ships
In addition to oil tankers, there are other specialized ships such as whaling ships
—including factory ships which process the catch into whale oil; cable ships which
undertake the laying, maintenance and repair of 20,000 miles of submarine cable;
and four weather ships which serve weather stations in the North Atlantic under
the joint support scheme of the International Civil Aviation Organization (see
p. 219). Relative newcomers to this category include vessels specially built to carry
ore, bulk sugar and other commodities. In 1953, four ore carriers were launched,
ranging from 6,000 to 11,000 gross tons.
SHIPPING ORGANIZATIONS
Excluding Government-owned tankers, cable ships, and ships owned by the
British Transport Commission (see p. 195), the business of merchant shipping
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 189
in peace time is in the hands of private enterprise. The main organizations con¬
cerned with the activities, interests and common problems of the industry are as
follows:
The Corporation of Lloyd's
This body, which was founded in the seventeenth century, is a society of under¬
writers whose main business is marine insurance (see also p. 261).
Lloyd's Register of Shipping
Lloyd’s Register is an organization, distinct from the Corporation, which surveys
and classifies ships with particular regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
It will accept responsibility for surveying and giving technical advice on vessels of
all flags from the initial stages of building, at regular intervals during their service,
and after casualties. A satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an under¬
writer that he may accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between
the Register and the Corporation of Lloyd’s.
The Corporation of Trinity House
This Corporation is administered by a Board of ten Elder Brethren elected from
the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy. The Corporation, which received its
first Royal Charter in the sixteenth century, is the general lighthouse authority for
England and Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar. It is also the chief pilotage
authority in the United Kingdom, having the management of all matters relating to
pilots and pilotage in the London area, the English Channel and certain other coastal
districts of the United Kingdom. (Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the
responsibility respectively of the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and
the Commissioners of Irish Lights.)
Shipowners' Organizations
The representative bodies speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for the
most part, owners of fishing vessels) are the Chamber of Shipping and the Liverpool
Steamship Owners' Association. The General Council of British Shipping co¬
ordinates the views of the shipping industry as a whole on all matters of major
policy.
There are a number of local associations of shipowners, centred around the
main port areas. There are, for example, the Bristol Steamship Owners' Association,
the London General Shipowners' Society, and the North of England Shipowners'
Association. Others represent companies specializing in a particular trade or type
of cargo.
Employers' Organizations
The Shipping Federation and the Employers' Association of the Port of Liverpool
are the employers’ organizations concerned with labour relations and the regulation
of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are responsible for the
administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, under which
shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 tons and above engage them through
the Merchant Navy Establishment Administration unless they are prepared to
offer two-year Company Service contracts. The Shipping Federation, which is
under the control of a Management Committee consisting of representatives of
shipowners’ and seafarers’ organizations and the Government Departments con¬
cerned, also operates the National Sea Training Schools set up for the purpose
of training ratings for the deck and catering department and as firemen.
19°
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Seafarers' Organizations
Masters and officers are represented by the Mercantile Marine Service Association,
the Navigators' and Engineer Officers' Union, the Marine Engineers' Association, the
Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Radio Officers' Union, as the case may be.
The National Union of Seamen represents the interests of Merchant Navy ratings.
The National Maritime Board
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representatives
of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations of wages and
conditions of service in the Merchant Navy, although, except by special arrange¬
ments, National Maritime Board Agreements do not apply to vessels under 200
gross tons, or to tugs, salvage vessels, etc. Detailed working of the Board is carried
on by a number of ‘panels’ representing the various interests of those forming
the seafarers’ part of the Board.
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution
Lifeboats in the United Kingdom are maintained by the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution, which depends entirely for its funds on voluntary subscriptions, and
very largely for its operation on voluntary workers.
Conferences
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a series
of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardization and stability of rates, and to
maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle of a confer¬
ence is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or passenger fares
from each port of departure. Each conference meets from time to time to review
and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones. Some of the conferences may
be connected by rate agreements, or may have joined together to form wider
groupings.
The Baltic Exchange
British tramp shipping, and indeed the tramp shipping of the world, is offered
and engaged for charter hire in London’s Baltic Exchange, where ship brokers
and owners meet and arrange contracts for the movement of all types of cargo
between any ports in the world.
RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT
The relations of the State with merchant shipping go back as far as 1381 when
the first of a series of Navigation Acts was passed. In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries these Acts were designed to give British ships a monopoly in
the carriage of goods to and from Britain and its colonies. The last of them was
repealed in 1849 under the influence of free trade ideas. But the same period found
the State taking an increasing interest in the shipping industry, particularly in
matters of safety and welfare. Today, the Government Department chiefly con¬
cerned is the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation. In the sphere of safety, it
is responsible for such matters as seeing that the load-line, which shows the depth
to which a ship may be safely loaded, is correctly indicated; that every ship has
adequate life-saving and fire-fighting equipment; and that the necessary standard
of safety is maintained in passenger ship construction. The Ministry is also
responsible for the issuing of certificates of competency to masters, navigating
and engineer officers, able seamen and lifeboatmen, and for the certification
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
191
of ships’ cooks. It also regulates such matters as crew accommodation on board
ship, scales and quality of provisions, and the carriage of medical stores. It is
responsible for running the Mercantile Marine offices at United Kingdom ports
at which crews are signed on, and for keeping the central registers of shipping and
seamen. The Ministry (with other Government Departments) is represented on
the Merchant Navy Welfare Board and the Merchant Navy Training Board (see
below). It also administers the Coastguard Service, which with a personnel of
about 500, working from some 170 stations, is responsible for rescue from ship¬
wreck; it works closely with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Apart from
these administrative functions, the Ministry maintains a close and friendly liaison
with the shipping industry on matters of policy and problems relating to imports
and exports and also to special passenger requirements.
Abroad, the Merchant Shipping Acts are administered by H.M. Consuls and
by officers of Commonwealth and Colonial Governments.
THE MERCHANT NAVY
Strength
The number of masters, officers and men (excluding Asiatic seamen serving on
articles of agreement opened in Asia) making up the strength of the British
Merchant Navy in December 1953 was about 145,000. In addition about 45,000
Indian, Pakistani and other Asiatic seamen serve regularly in British ships.
Training
The policy of Merchant Navy training is determined by the Merchant Navy
Training Board, which comprises representatives of the shipowners, officers’ and
men’s societies, the Government Departments concerned, pre-sea training establish¬
ments, the Association of Education Committees and the Association of Navigation
Schools. The function of the Board is to consider and make recommendations
concerning the training of the various classes of boys and men who enter the
different departments in the Merchant Navy, but it rests with the shipping
industry itself and the appropriate Government Departments to decide whether
any particular recommendation should be adopted. Separate panels have been
formed within the Board to consider training of the various categories of seafarers,
namely, deck officers and deck ratings, engineer officers and engine-room ratings,
and catering ratings.
All boys who wish to join the Merchant Navy as deck or junior catering ratings
must undergo a course of pre-sea training. The majority receive their training at
the Natioal nSea Training Schools but courses are also provided by certain private
organizations and by a number of local education authorities.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom registered
ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B., granted by the Ministry
of Transport and Civil Aviation. To obtain this certificate a seaman must, among
other qualifications, have served three years at sea on deck, have attained a Certifi¬
cate of Proficiency as Lifeboatman and have passed an oral and practical qualifying
examination. This qualifying examination for the certificate may, however, be
taken on reaching the age of 18 after twelve months’ service at sea as a deck rating,
and those who pass may be issued with an Efficient Deck Hand Certificate, which
enables the holder to serve at sea in a similar capacity to an A.B.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of Petty Officer. Service
as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examination for a
Second Mate’s Certificate.
192
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Pre-sea training is not compulsory for those who go to sea as apprentices or
cadets but most shipping companies will, in practice, accept only those who have
undergone such a course. There are a number of residential and non-residential
training establishments, some of which are Public Schools, which provide courses
of varying length. The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation allows a proportion
of the time spent in approved establishments to count towards the period of
sea service which the apprentice or cadet is required to perform before becoming
eligible to take the examination for a Second Mate’s Certificate. Navigating
Officers become eligible for examinations for First Mate’s and Master’s Certifi¬
cates after further periods of qualifying sea service.
Sea-going engineer officers usually receive their basic training in engineering by
serving a suitable apprenticeship of not less than four years in engineering work¬
shops ashore, although part of this period may be spent at approved courses in
mechanical engineering. An alternative scheme of training has, however, recently
been introduced under which shipping companies themselves select apprentices
for a special course of training consisting of a two-year diploma course in a techni¬
cal college, followed by eighteen months’ training at sea and finally twelve months’
training in an engineering workshop ashore. Sea-going engineer officers are first
employed as Junior Engineers: they become eligible to take examinations for
Second and First Class Certificates of competency after performing periods of
qualifying sea service.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of Proficiency in Wireless Tele¬
graphy issued by the Postmaster-General on the results of an open examination.
Conditions of Employment and Welfare
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board (see p. 190). Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for
both officers and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service
Scheme, introduced by the Board, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take two-year
contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with the industry as a
whole, and get special benefits, in addition to the normal unemployment insurance
when they are ashore between voyages.
The Merchant Navy Welfare Board, on which are represented officers’ and
seamen’s unions and associations, shipowners, voluntary societies, the Ministries
of Transport and Civil Aviation, Labour and National Service, Pensions and
National Insurance, and the Colonial Office, has been responsible since 1948 for
the control and co-ordination of the welfare services for merchant seamen in the
United Kingdom and of British merchant seamen abroad.
In the United Kingdom, the Board runs 15 Port Welfare Committees and has
regional seamen’s welfare officers in Glasgow, Liverpool and South Shields. It
manages directly a number of Merchant Navy houses and clubs, and many others
are run by voluntary societies. In oversea ports the voluntary societies run some
300 clubs for British merchant seamen.
PORTS
There are over 300 ports in the United Kingdom. The ten largest are shown in
Table 33, which lists them in order of tonnage of shipping arriving and departing
and does not relate to the volume of cargo handled. Most ports, other than those
owned by the British Transport Commission, are represented on the Dock and
Harbour Authorities’ Association, formed in 1917 to represent the common interests
of port authorities in their relations with Government, shipowners and traders.

The Principal Ports
The Port of London, with 69 miles of waterway and over 4,000 acres of dock
estate, handles more tonnage annually than any other in the world except New
York. Goods of every imaginable kind, from meat to marble, from plywood to
perfume, pass through the docks. Imports are distributed all over the United
Kingdom, though the port supplies primarily Greater London and the Home
Counties with a population of some million persons.
Liverpool—with Manchester, an inland city made into a port by the construction
of the Manchester Ship Canal—serves the industrial Midlands, Lancashire and
Yorkshire. Grain is prominent among the imports of Liverpool, which, including
Birkenhead on the opposite bank of the Mersey, is the second largest milling
centre in the world. Tobacco is another major import and is stored in what is
probably the world’s largest warehouse. Liverpool is also important for transatlantic
passenger traffic and short sea-routes and coastwise trading. Manchester’s chief
import is raw cotton.
Southampton, largest of the Channel ports, is the chief port for ocean passenger
traffic. It owes its importance to its double tides and easy access from London.
A considerable volume of oil is now handled for the refinery at Fawley.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial North-East
and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest ship-repairing centre
in the country.
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of York¬
shire and the Midlands. Middlesbrough imports iron ore for, and exports iron and
steel from, the local iron and steel industries.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
194
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales. As
well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its immediate
neighbourhood, but its rapidly increasing importance derives largely from the oil
which it imports and exports for local refineries.
Bristol and Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the highly
industrialized city of Bristol itself, and have also a large coastal trade.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the industrial
area dependent on the Lanarkshire coalfields.
Grangemouth, also in Scotland, handles mainly crude oil for the local refinery,
and also imports timber and paper-making materials.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main Irish
Sea traffic.
Ownership
The ports previously owned by the main-line railway companies are now under _
national ownership and are administered by the British Transport Commission
(see p. 195). Important examples are Southampton (docks only), Hull, Swansea,
Cardiff and Middlesbrough (docks only), Harwich, Folkestone, Newhaven
and Holyhead.
Others are controlled by a public trust on which are represented users of the
port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other bodies such
as Government Departments and local authorities. Examples are London (con¬
trolled by the Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour
Board), Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners) and Glasgow (Clyde Navigation
Trust). The Port of London Authority has 28 members. Ten of the members are
nominated as follows: by the Admiralty (1), the Ministry of Transport and Civil
Aviation (2), the London County Council (4), the Corporation of the City of
London (2), and the Corporation of Trinity House (1). Eighteen of the members
represent various port users: shipowners (8), merchants (8), owners of river craft
(1), and public wharfingers (1). The Authority’s duties include the maintenance
of adequate river channels, the regulation of traffic, the provision and upkeep of
moorings and the licensing of wharves and structures in the area under its control.
A few ports—Bristol is the most important example—are owned by the town
or city council and controlled entirely by a committee of the council.
Finally, there are about 100 ports which are privately owned. Manchester is
the only major port so owned—by the Manchester Ship Canal Company and
here the Manchester City Council exercises considerable control by appointing
11 of the Company’s 21 directors.
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main, set
down in private Acts of Parliament which relate specifically to the ports concerned.
Labour
There are about 150,000 people employed in the operation of British ports. Just
under half of these are administrative, clerical and technical staff, and pilots, lighter¬
men, customs officials and so on. Over half are the dock workers (formerly and still
popularly called ‘dockers’) who do the physical work of handling cargo.
Shipping arrivals and departures do not all conform to a regular schedule, with
the result that there is sometimes too much work for the dock workers available,
sometimes too little. Dock labour was therefore largely casual labour until 194b
when war-time schemes were introduced to control the port registers of employers
and workers. The war-time schemes were superseded in 1947 by a permanent
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
195
scheme administered by the National Dock Labour Board. Workers on these registers
now receive a guaranteed minimum wage even when there is not enough work for
all of them. The Board consists of a chairman, vice-chairman, and eight members
appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, four to represen
employers and four to represent dock workers.
INLAND TRANSPORT
In 1953 the number of passenger journeys made in public service vehicles (road
and rail) in the United Kingdom vras about 20,000 million, rather over one per day
for every person in the country. In addition, about 2,800,000 motor cars and over
one million motor cycles were licensed for use on the roads. The annual mileage of
most of these vehicles is believed to be between five and ten thousand. Journeys
by public transport are mainly short and a great many of them are to and from
places of work. The resultant concentration of travel in the morning and evening
‘rush hours’ constitutes a formidable problem in London and other centres of
industry and commerce.
The extent of freight traffic in the United Kingdom can be roughly gauged from
the fact that in 1953 British Railways carried over 22,000 million net ton miles1 of
goods, while there were nearly a million goods vehicles on the roads, whose
aggregate net ton mileage is believed to be little less than that of the railways.
The dense traffic of the United Kingdom is carried mainly by road and rail,
though some freight is carried by canal. There are in the United Kingdom some
52,000 miles of railway track and nearly 200,000 miles of road, of which only about
one quarter can be classed as main roads. The railway network was developed
mainly in the nineteenth century from 1840 onwards (and there are now more
railways per square mile in Britain than in any other country, except Belgium),
while the building of new motor roads and the widening and strengthening of old
ones to accommodate the increasing motor vehicle traffic has been a feature of the
twentieth century.
The State has for a long time exercised considerable control over public transport
operators, and the scope and degree of regulation in the interest both of public
safety and of efficiency has increased throughout the twentieth century.
The Transport Act, 1947
On 1 st January 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Act,
1947, most of Great Britain’s2 inland transport system, other than road transport,
passed into public ownership. On that date, the railways, all railway-owned steam¬
ships, docks, hotels and road transport interests, most of the country’s canals
(including all those owned by the railways) and the whole of London’s passenger
transport system came under the control of the British Transport Commission, a
public corporation which was given the duty of providing an efficient, adequate,
economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port
facilities for passengers and goods. In addition, the Commission was to arrange for
the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance road haulage firms.
Road passenger transport outside London was not taken over, but the Commis¬
sion was given power to prepare area schemes for co-ordinating passenger services

by road and rail, including power to acquire road passenger undertakings for this
purpose. A considerable amount of road haulage, several waterways and many docks
were left outside the Commission’s scope.
By the 1947 Act the Commission was made responsible to the Minister of
Transport (now the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation) who, in turn, is
responsible to Parliament. The Minister was to appoint the members of the
Commission, and was empowered to give general directions to the Commission in
the national interest and to approve the general outline of programmes of major
development and of training, education and research. With the consent of the
Minister, the Commission was given power to borrow up to £275 million. An
annual report and statement of accounts was to be submitted to the Minister who
would lay it before Parliament. Jurisdiction over transport charges of all kinds was
given to the Transport Tribunal (formerly the Railway Rates Tribunal established
in 1921): all charges schemes proposed by the Commission were to be approved by
the Tribunal. Transport users were to be given an opportunity of putting forward
criticism and constructive suggestions for improving transport services through a
Central Transport Consultative Committee for Great Britain and Area Transport
Users’ Consultative Committees, including one each for Scotland and Wales. The
members of these Committees were to be appointed by the Minister, after con¬
sultation with the interests concerned, to represent commerce, industry, labour and
local authorities. The Minister would also appoint members from persons nominated
by the Commission. Eleven area committees have in fact been set up. They report
to the Central Committee and the Commission, and the Central Committee reports
to the Commission and the Minister who can give directions to the Commission
upon any recommendation of the Central Committee. (Since 1953 the Scottish and
Welsh committees also report direct to the Minister, who can give directions upon
their recommendations.)
As agents of the Commission, six executives were appointed to run different
parts of the system it took over: (1) the Railway Executive, to be responsible for the
railways, which were organized in six regions; (2) the Road Transport Executive,
which in June 1949 was renamed the Road Haulage Executive, to operate long¬
distance road transport which was organized in eight geographical divisions;
(3) the Road Passenger Executive, which was set up in June 1949 as a planning
and advisory body to promote area schemes for the co-ordination of road passenger
transport services; (4) the Hotels Executive to run the railway hotels and catering
services; (5) the London Transport Executive to operate road and rail passenger
transport in the London area; and (6) the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive
to be responsible for canals and the former railway-owned docks.
The Transport Act, 1953
Changes in the organization briefly outlined above are now being put into effect
under the Transport Act, 1953.
The broad purpose of this Act was described by the Minister of Transport,
speaking for the Conservative Government during the second reading of the Bill.
He said: ‘We believe that competition gives a better service than monopoly. We
believe that the best way to have a good service is through decentralization; and
that independent private enterprise, or in the case of the railways, regional enter¬
prise, is the best way to achieve this decentralization’.
The main provisions of this Act were accordingly directed to returning road
haulage to private enterprise by arranging for the disposal of most of the Commis¬
sion’s road haulage undertaking, and to increasing the competitive efficiency of the
railways. To this end the Commission was ordered to submit a scheme of railway
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

organization and decentralization including the abolition of the Railway Executive;
it was also given more latitude in fixing railway charges. Further details of these
provisions and an account of the action taken to implement them are given on
pp. 198-9 and 203-4.
Other important provisions of the Act were as follows:
1. The Commission’s power to make area schemes for the co-ordination of road
and rail passenger services and trade harbours schemes was revoked.
2. The Commission’s maximum membership was to be increased. It would
consist of a chairman and up to 14 members, all of whom could be part time.
Abolition of Executives
All the Commission’s remaining Executives (the Road Passenger Executive had
been abolished in October 1952) except the London Transport Executive were
abolished as from 1st October 1953* The Docks and Inland Waterways Executive
was replaced by a Board of Management, and the Hotels Executive by a Hotels and
Catering Services Committee to be known as British Transport Hotels and Catering
Services; interim arrangements were made for the railways (see p. 199), and pend¬
ing the disposal of the road haulage assets a Board of Management was set up for
road haulage (see p. 204).
RAILWAYS
Britain was the pioneer of railway development which provided the improved
transport essential to industrial and commercial expansion.
Railroads were in use around pits and iron works before the end of the sixteenth
century. Trucks were mainly drawn by horses. The first railroad to carry goods for
the public was the Surrey Iron Railway built between Wandsworth and Croydon in
1801 to 1803. In 1812, William Hedley, a colliery engineer, following up the work
of William Symington, William Murdock, Richard Trevithick and others, showed
how locomotives could be used on railroads. About the same time, George
Stephenson improved the efficiency of existing models by increasing the draught to
the fire-box. In 1825 the Stockton to Darlington railway was opened and became
the first public railroad on which locomotives were used. The first public line built
expressly to use only locomotive haulage was the Liverpool and Manchester rail¬
way of 1830. Stephenson’s ‘Rocket’ was the chosen locomotive, as a result of a
competition in 1829. From that time, the potentialities of the locomotive railway
began to be fully developed.
At first, railway projects were mainly local, promoted by groups of people
concerned with the needs of particular areas. Parliamentary sanction had to be
sought for each project. The general opinion was that the company would provide
the track but would not necessarily act as carriers. Private carriers often ran their
vehicles over the companies’ lines. But the realization that for reasons of safety and
efficiency the company must have all traffic under its own control was endorsed by
a Parliamentary Committee in 1839. Railway building was particularly rapid
between 1840 and 1875, with a short lull following the collapse of a speculative
railway boom in 1846. This period also saw the beginning of a process of amalgama¬
tion in order to achieve the economics of concentration and large-scale operation.
The State began to intervene. Thus, in 1846 an Act of Parliament prescribed a
standard gauge of 4 feet 8J inches for all new lines except extensions of the Great
Western Railway which had a gauge of 7 feet. Not until 1892 was the Great
Western gauge completely converted to the standard gauge. In 1850 statutory
recognition was given to the Railway Clearing House which began in 1842 and had
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

the function of facilitating through traffic by providing for the adjustment of
balances between companies. The Railway and Canal T. raffle Act of 1854 laid upon
the companies the obligation of providing reasonable facilities, especially for through
traffic, and of avoiding undue preference between users. In 1873 jurisdiction under
this Act was given to a body of three Railway Commissioners which in 1888 was
renamed the Railway and Canal Commission. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act
of 1888 drew up a standard freight classification and schedules of maximum freight
charges which came into operation in 1893. A company wishing to increase these
rates had to justify itself to the Railway and Canal Commission.
During the 1914-18 war the railways were controlled by the Government, acting
through a Railway Executive Committee consisting of the general managers of
some of the larger companies. This arrangement made clear the advantages of con¬
centration and it was decided that the handing back of the railways to the companies
should be accompanied by a comprehensive reorganization. By the Railways Act of
1921, 123 companies were amalgamated into four large groups the London,
Midland and Scottish; London and North Eastern; Great W estern, and Southern.
A new tribunal, the Railway Rates Tribunal, was established to take over the
jurisdiction over charges and questions of undue preference of the Railway and
Canal Commission. It was to carry out an annual review of standard rates and fares
which were to be adjusted with reference to the principle of maintaining to the
companies a standard net revenue equivalent to that of 1913.
In the inter-war years, the railways suffered both from the general industrial
depression and from the growing competition of road transport, and the standard
net revenue was never earned. Efforts were made to improve services and effi¬
ciency. In 1928 powers were obtained from Parliament to own and operate road
services. But the railways were at a disadvantage in competing with road hauliers;
the latter were not, as were the railways, bound to accept all traffic; their rates were
flexible and need not avoid undue preference, and they were not heavily capitalized
undertakings. In 1938, the railways put forward ‘Square Deal’ proposals calling for
relief from statutory regulation of charges and for freedom to decide for themselves
the rates for merchandise carried. The campaign was interrupted by the outbreak
of war in 1939 when the railways again passed under the control of Government,
acting, as in the 1914-18 war, through a Railway Executive Committee.
British Railways
In 1947 the Transport Act brought the railways of Great Britain1 into public
ownership and created a Railway Executive empowered to operate them on behalf
of the British Transport Commission as a single enterprise known as British
Railways, with six regional sub-divisions—London—Midland, W estern, Eastern,
Southern, North Eastern and Scottish—corresponding broadly to the former
companies.
The Transport Act, 1953, reversed the policy of centralization, and instructed
the British Transport Commission to prepare a scheme for railway reorganization
and decentralization. The scheme was to provide for the abolition of the Railway
Executive (if not already abolished) and for the setting up of area administrations
which might follow the existing pattern of regions, to which many of the Commis¬
sion’s powers would be delegated. But there would still be central responsibility
for some matters including wages and charges.
To increase the competitive power of the railways, the Commission was to have
more latitude in fixing railway charges, e.g., only the maximum rates would need

to be provided for and published and not concessions made to secure competitive
business.
From 1st October 1953 interim arrangements came into effect pending the
reorganization envisaged in the Act. The Railway Executive was abolished and the
Commission became the employer of all officers and staff of the British Railways.
The six regions remained unchanged but wider powers were given to the Chief
Regional Officers who became known as Chief Regional Managers.
The Commission’s scheme for the reorganization of the railways was published
as a White Paper on 13th July 1954 and followed the general principles of the
interim arrangements.
The Commission proposed that the existing six regions should be the areas
envisaged under the Act. The area authorities should be boards, each consisting of
not more than seven persons including a chairman, one or more of the members
being a member of the Commission. Members would be drawn in part from out¬
side the industry but would not be representatives of particular interests; they
would not be expected to devote the whole of their time to the work of the authori¬
ties. The Commission considered that its control in the scheme of organization
should be absolute and that it alone should appoint the members of the area
authorities. The area authorities would not be incorporated, and the Commission
would remain the employers of staff; it would also retain general financial control
including the control of charges.
Within the framework of their responsibilities to the Commission, the area
authorities would be responsible for the management of the railway system in their
areas, but they would leave day-to-day management to their Chief Regional
Managers who would continue to maintain close contact with the staff at Commis¬
sion Headquarters. Functions delegated to the area authorities, which they would
exercise in the name of the Commission, would be to promote initiative in improv¬
ing services and facilities and in effecting economies; to ensure that contact would
be made with users to meet their requirements to the fullest extent possible; and
to ensure that proper measures would be taken regarding the safety, health and
welfare of the Commission’s employees.
The scheme was accepted and is being put into operation.

The railway system is, of course, fully signalled and has a complete telephone
and telegraphic network. A system whereby trains are automatically warned and
controlled if signals are against them has been in operation on the Western Region
—formerly the area of the Great Western Railway—since 1905. The general
adoption of a suitable system on all main line railways has been studied since
nationalization and plans are in hand for its installation.
The largest railway station in the country is Waterloo, the London terminus of
the South Western main and suburban lines in the Southern Region. It has
14,901 feet of platform face (i.e. the side of the platform towards lines). The
longest single platform face on British Railways is at Manchester; it extends for
2,194 feet through the adjacent Victoria and Exchange Stations.
Major development works include the electrification of the line between
Manchester, Sheffield and Wath, which was opened in September 1954.
Motive power is the subject of continuous study. Twelve standard classes of
steam locomotives are being introduced, while experiments are being carried out
with diesel-electric locomotives on main line work. Diesel-electric traction
is already being employed for shunting in marshalling yards, where it is
more economic than steam traction, and in multiple unit passenger trains. The
testing of the design, construction and operation of steam locomotives is carried
out at the Locomotive Testing Station at Rugby, which was opened in October
I948-
Refreshment rooms and restaurant and buffet car services are the responsibility of
British Transport Hotels and Catering Services. Staff employed at the end of 1953
numbered 15,374. Refreshment rooms are operated, often by concessionaires, at
400 stations, and in 1953 approximately ten million meals were served on trains.
There are 40 railway hotels. The policy has been to sell hotels not connected with
transport.
Accidents on British Railways are rare; the only major accident in 1953, a
collision between a steam passenger train and an electric train on the Irk Valley
viaduct in Lancashire on 15th August, caused the death of ten persons.
ROADS
The road system is complex and to a large extent haphazard. For centuries after
the Romans left Britain, road building and maintenance was left mainly to the

parish which was naturally concerned only with local needs. The most effective
intervention by the central Government was in the seventeenth century with the
institution of turnpike trusts. The maintenance of a length of road was placed in
the hands of a trust, made up of private individuals, empowered to levy tolls at the
gates it erected at the limits of its jurisdiction. Early in the nineteenth century there
were 1,000 of these trusts administering some 22,000 miles of road. The same
period was also notable for improvements in construction associated with the names
of Telford, who emphasized the importance of solid foundations, and McAdam,
who demonstrated the value of an arched surface of broken stone or flint. Turnpike
roads made it possible for coaches to reach an average speed of 12 miles an hour.
But transport by river and canal retained the advantage in handling bulky traffic,
and as the nineteenth century progressed, the railways almost drove long-distance
road transport out of existence. Roads held their own in towns where horse-drawn
omnibus services were developed and then horse tramways, the first of which were
introduced into London and Birkenhead in the early 1860s. Towards the end of the
nineteenth century the tramways were electrified and largely taken over by local
authorities. London’s trams have now disappeared, as have those of many other
towns and cities.
While tramways were still being developed, there came the internal combustion
engine and the rapid increase in the number of motor cars. In 1909, the Govern¬
ment set up a Road Board to assist in providing new and better roads to meet the
needs of the new traffic. In 1919 the Board’s responsibilities were taken over by the
newly created Ministry of Transport.
In I953» Great Britain had 186,261 miles of public highway, over two miles for
every square mile of territory. There were 8,254 miles of trunk roads, 19,551 miles
of Class I roads, 17,700 miles of Class II roads, 48,693 miles of Class III roads, and
92,063 miles of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to their traffic
value, those of purely local traffic importance remaining unclassified. Trunk roads
are the main arteries of national traffic and the whole cost of their upkeep is met
from the Road Fund, administered by the Minister of Transport, who is the high¬
way authority for these roads. On maps and signposts the trunk and Class I roads
can mostly be identified by the letter ‘A’ in front of a route number, and Class II
roads by the letter ‘B’. The Minister makes grants from the Road Fund towards
approved expenditure on Class I, II and III roads at the rates of 75, 60 and 50 per
cent respectively. The highway authorities for these and for unclassified roads are
the local authorities—in most cases the councils of counties and county boroughs.
The Road Fund, established in 1921, was originally financed by the proceeds from
motor vehicle and driving licence duties, but since the Finance Act, 1936, the
proceeds of motor taxation have been paid into the Exchequer and the Road Fund
is financed, like any other Government-assisted service, by means of annual grants
voted by Parliament.
In the year ended 31st March 1953 total expenditure on highways amounted
to £86,028,000, of which £10,794,000 was spent on trunk roads. In all, £31,459,000
of the expenditure was borne by the Road Fund. Economic difficulties since the
war have restricted expenditure on major improvements and new construction.
But a programme of such works has been put in hand in the financial year 1954-55
which will cost the Exchequer a total of £19! million in 1954-55 and about £50
million in the three years 1954-57.
In November 1954 the Government decided to embark on an expanded pro¬
gramme of road construction and improvement designed to increase safety on
the roads and to relieve traffic congestion, and in February 1955 announced its
intention of spending £147 million on these projects over the next four years.

Roads in Northern Ireland
There are 13,255 miles of public roads in Northern Ireland, comprising 347 miles
of trunk roads, 960 miles of Class I roads, 1,742 miles of Class II roads, 2,749 rniles
of Class III roads and 7,457 miles of unclassified roads.
In the year ended 31st March 1953 approximately £4 million was spent on
road works.
The Ministry of Commerce is the road authority for the trunk roads and the
cost of maintenance and improvement is met out of moneys voted by Parliament.
The road authorities for the other classes of public roads are the local authorities
within whose areas the roads lie, and the cost of reconstruction, maintenance and
improvement of the roads is a charge on the income of those bodies. Grants from
the Northern Ireland Road Fund are, however, made to the local authorities in aid
of their expenditure on road works. The rates of grant range from 72 per cent to
30 per cent for reconstruction and from 60 per cent to 20 per cent for maintenance
and improvement, according to the classification of the road.
ROAD TRANSPORT
Between 1830 and the 1914-18 war, the railways were unchallenged as the chief
means of transport in the country; the war, however, greatly stimulated the
development and use of motor transport. In the period immediately following the
1914-18 war, the growth of public road transport began to make itself felt as a
serious competitor of the railways and there was violent competition within the
road transport industry itself. In 1928 a Royal Commission on Transport was
appointed to consider the issues involved, and following its recommendations
legislation was introduced. The Road Traffic Act, 1930, provided either directly or
by regulations for (i) a reclassification of motor vehicles and the re-enactment of the
licensing system for drivers; (ii) the prescription of speed limits and a variety of
‘safety’ measures, including a restriction on the hours during which drivers of
public service and goods vehicles could remain continuously on duty; (iii) the issue
of orders governing the construction and use of motor vehicles; (iv) compulsory
insurance against third party risks; and (v) the introduction of a comprehensive
licensing system for public service (passenger) vehicles, under which bodies of
Traffic Commissioners (now called Licensing Authorities for Public Service
Vehicles) were created to have the duty, within defined Traffic Areas, of licensing
vehicles, drivers and conductors, and services operated. Each Licensing Authority
consists of a full-time chairman appointed by the Minister and two part-time
members chosen by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by local
authorities. Applications for licences for road services are considered at public
sittings at which the applicants and competing operators or local authorities can
exercise a right of objection; the Licensing Authority has power to suspend or
revoke a licence in certain circumstances. Although the Minister can issue general
directions to Licensing Authorities he has no power to intervene in their decisions,
unless an applicant or an objector being aggrieved at a decision appeals to him. The
effect of this system has been to ensure for road passenger transport the regularity
and reliability which has been a feature of railway services.
In 1933 the Road and Rail Traffic Act was passed; it was based on the recom¬
mendations of the Royal Commission and on those contained in a report of
a conference of experts, known as the Salter Report. A system of licensing for
road haulage vehicles was introduced and three types of carriers’ licences were
instituted: the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage; the ‘B’ licence for public
haulage limited to certain goods or certain areas and covering also the carriage of
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
203
the licensee’s own goods; and the ‘C’ licence for the carriage by traders of their
own goods alone. The Licensing Authorities for Goods Vehicles are the Chairmen
of the Licensing Authorities for Public Service Vehicles in each Traffic Area, and
applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences are considered at public inquiries as in the case
of road service licences under the Road Traffic Act, 1930; ‘C’ licences are granted
on application without public inquiry. A licence can be suspended or revoked by a
Licensing Authority for breaches of licence conditions committed frequently,
wilfully or to the public danger. There is a right of appeal against a decision of a
Licensing Authority to an independent tribunal, the Transport Tribunal, and not
as under the Act of 1930 to the Minister. The effect of this system has been to relate
the operations of vehicles under ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences to approved needs and to
eliminate wasteful competition between the different forms of transport.
During the 1939-45 war commercial vehicles were subject to a considerable
degree of direct control through a system of permits and fuel rationing. The
Ministry of War Transport’s Road Haulage Organization, set up in 1943, came to
control many of the larger undertakings and hired a large number of vehicles
engaged in long and short distance work. Vehicles were handed back to their
owners when the Organization came to an end in 1946 and the carriers’ licence
system, which had been suspended, was resumed. At the end of 1946 there were
90,683 vehicles on ‘A’ licences, 58,386 on ‘B’ licences and 383,738 on ‘C’ licences,
a total of 532,807 vehicles.
The Transport Act, 1947, established the British Transport Commission which
took over ‘A’ and ‘B’ hauliers predominantly engaged on long-distance haulage.
Vehicles operating under ‘C’ licences and those used for carrying certain specialized
traffics were not affected by the Act; ‘A’ and ‘B’ licensed vehicles which were not
acquired by the Commission could only be used on journeys of over 25 miles from
base under permits granted by the Commission. By the end of 1951, when the
acquisition of vehicles by the Commission was completed, 3,266 undertakings
with 41,265 vehicles and 3,018 trailers had been acquired. Carriers’ licences were
not required for vehicles operated by the various Executives of the Commission.
The Transport Act, 1953, required the British Transport Commission to dispose
of the bulk of its road haulage undertaking and all vehicles operated by the Commis¬
sion were made subject to the carriers’ licence system.
The Commission was to be allowed to retain a proportion of its road haulage
fleet corresponding broadly to the interest the railways had in road haulage when
they were taken over on 1st January 1948. The disposal operation was to be
carried out by the Commission as quickly as possible under the supervision of a
Road Haulage Disposal Board. Purchasers of the Commission’s road haulage
property were entitled to operate the vehicles bought immediately without restric¬
tion as to distance from their operating centres, while the 25 miles radius limit was
to be removed from all operators on 1st January 1955.
The Act also provided for a levy on ordinary goods vehicles of more than 1J tons
unladen weight, and on general haulage tractors. The levy was required to defray
the capital loss suffered by the Commission on the disposal of its road haulage
undertaking and for ‘disturbance’ during the process. The rate of the levy was
fixed for 1954 and 1955, at a level which would produce approximately £4 million
a year, and could then be varied at three-yearly intervals according to requirements.
When sufficient money had been collected to meet the necessary payments, the
levy would cease.
The Road Haulage Disposal Board was set up in May 1953. There are six
members appointed by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation. Invitations
to tender for the first transport units offered for sale were published in November
204
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
1953. In its first report, covering the six months to 28th November 1953, the
Board emphasized the difficulties of the task. ‘This undertaking is not merely a
collection of motor vehicles and trailers, but is a large integrated business ordered
to be sold at the best aggregate price. The land and premises included in the
undertaking stand in the books of the Commission (at the end of 1952) at £i4'8
million; plant and equipment and the stocks of stores stand at £S-g million and
cover some millions of separate items. These sums together, at £23-7 million,
compare with a slightly smaller figure for vehicles (after deduction of accumulated
depreciation) of £21-9 million.’
Pending the disposal of the road haulage assets, the road haulage activities of the
Road Haulage Executive are being carried on as British Road Services by a Board
of Management consisting of the chairman of the old Executive and three full-time
and two part-time members also drawn from the Executive.
At the end of 1953, including British Transport Commission vehicles, there were
89,444 goods vehicles on ‘A’ licences, 63,622 vehicles on ‘B’ licences and 866,322
on ‘C’ licences, making a total of 1,019,388 vehicles.
Road Safety
There are now some five million road vehicles licensed to use Great Britain’s
roads, of which two and three-quarter million are motor cars and over a million
are motor cycles. Traffic density is, therefore, high, presenting problems of control
and safety. In 1953, 5,090 people were killed on the roads and 221,680 injured.
Vigorous road safety campaigns are conducted by local authorities with the aid of
government grants. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the police
and education authorities are all actively at work to the same end. A new system
of pedestrian crossings has been introduced, a feature of which is the more con¬
spicuous marking which takes the form of white stripes—hence the name ‘zebra
crossings’—illuminated by flashing beacons. The standard of conduct for all road
users—pedestrians and drivers—is set out in The Highway Code issued by the
Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation. A failure to observe any provision of this
code does not of itself render a person liable to criminal proceedings of any kind
but it may be taken into account in any such proceedings. Drivers of motor vehicles
—including motor cycles and powered pedal cycles—all have to pass a driving test
before being granted a substantive licence to drive; until they pass the test they
may obtain a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘L’ (Learner)
plates and, in all cases of vehicles constructed to carry passengers, being accom¬
panied by a qualified driver.
INLAND WATERWAYS
In 1761 James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from the
collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester. This
marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain which played an impor¬
tant part in promoting the industrial and commercial expansion of the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Most of the present network—except,
notably, the Manchester Ship Canal which was built between 1888 and 1894—was
completed by 1840 when the development of railways brought to an end the golden
age of canals.
There are some 2,200 miles of inland waterways open to traffic in Great Britain.
The British Transport Commission is responsible for about 2,000 miles. Canals
account for 1,750 miles. Under the Docks and Inland Waterways Board of
Management, the canals in England and Wales are grouped into four divisions
based on the main navigable river estuaries:
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
205
(1) The North-Eastern Division is based on the Humber estuary and the ports of
Hull, Grimsby, Goole and Immingham.
(2) The North-Western Division is based on the Mersey estuary and its water¬
ways are connected with Liverpool and Birkenhead, Ellesmere Port, Weston
Point Docks, Manchester, and with Hull via Leeds.
(3) The South-Western Division is based on the Severn estuary and its water¬
ways are related to the ports of Avonmouth, Gloucester, Sharpness, Barry,
Lydney, Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
(4) The South-Eastern Division is based on the Thames estuary and its water¬
ways give access to the Port of London.
Canals in Scotland, which are separately administered under the Board of
Management are the Caledonian Canal, the Crinan Canal, the Forth and Clyde
Canal and the Union Canal.
There are broad waterways which can be used by craft with up to 400 tons
capacity and narrow waterways which can generally be used only by boats not
exceeding 7 feet in width. Broad waterways are mainly the canalized rivers—e.g.,
the Severn, Lee and Stort Navigation, Trent Navigation, Aire and Calder Naviga¬
tion—while narrow waterways are mainly the canals in the interior—e.g., the
Grand Union, the Shropshire Union and the Birmingham network. The canals in
Scotland are broad. Most of the traffic on the waterways is carried by independent
carriers or by traders in their own craft. The British Transport Commission, how¬
ever, at the end of 1953 owned 1,283 craft with a carrying capacity of 44,227 tons,
including 246 power-driven craft with a capacity of 8,270 tons. Work is being done
to increase canal capacities, e.g., by dredging, straightening bends, deepening and
opening up bottle-necks, and by developing improved types of craft. In 1953, total
traffic on the Commission’s waterways amounted to 12-7 million tons, of which
6-9 million tons were coal and coke, 1-9 million tons liquids in bulk and 3-9 million
tons general merchandise. About 98 per cent of this traffic is carried on 1,200 miles
of the Commission’s 2,000 miles of waterway. This indicates a problem of moribund
canals which has to be tackled.
Docks and Harbours Administered by the Commission
The British Transport Commission owns about 30 per cent of Britain’s dock
accommodation with a total of over half a million feet of quays. A few of the
Commission’s ports are docks developed by former canal undertakings such as the
Aire and Calder Navigation which developed Goole. The rest are those formerly
owned by the railways. In some cases—e.g., at Southampton and Middlesbrough—
the railways owned the main docks in ports where the statutory authority was a
harbour board. In other cases—e.g., at Grangemouth, Garston and Grimsby—the
port was largely developed by the railway company which was itself the statutory
harbour authority. Some railway-owned ports were mainly links with the railway :
holkestone, Harwich, Newhaven, Fishguard and Heysham are in this category. In
!9S3, nearly 70 million tons of cargo were handled at the Commission’s docks and
harbours, at which, at the end of the year, about 21,000 people were employed.
LONDON TRANSPORT
London’s transport system, in its modern sense, may be said to have begun when
in 1829, four years after the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, the
first omnibus—horse-drawn—appeared on the London streets. Trams, also horse-
drawn, appeared in 1861. In 1863 the first underground steam railway, the
206
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Metropolitan, was built by digging a great trench for the line and roofing it over.
In 1870 a better method for building a railway inside a city was found when the
Tower Subway was constructed. The line was laid in an entirely underground
tunnel shaped like a hollow tube and thus became the world’s first tube railway. In
1890 the City and South London, the first electric tube railway in the world, was
opened, and it was followed soon after by the Central London Railway, called the
‘twopenny tube’ because all journeys on it cost twopence. Soon after this buses
and trams ceased to be horse-drawn and used petrol and electricity respectively for
their motive power, and trams, buses and underground railways rapidly developed
into the vast network of London’s transport system.
Until 1933 there was no unified operation. The large number of transport
interests included: the main line railways with their suburban services; an Under¬
ground Group controlling most of the underground railways, the General buses,
Green Line coaches and three tramway companies; the independent Metropolitan
Railway Company; London County Council tramways; 13 municipal tramway
undertakings; and some 60 small independent bus undertakings. But in i933> the
whole system, except the main line railways’ suburban services, was vested in a
public corporation, the London Passenger Transport Board. During the I939~45
war, London transport was taken over by the Government and operated, like the
main line railways, through the Railway Executive Committee. In 1948, following
the establishment of the British Transport Commission, the London Transport
Executive took over control.
The London Transport Executive is responsible for the operation of passenger
road and rail services in the London area with the exception of the main line rail¬
ways, certain suburban services which came under the Railway Executive, and
taxicabs, which are all privately operated by companies or owner-drivers.1
The Executive consists of a chairman and five members, of whom four are full¬
time and one part-time. The chairman and full-time members each have special
functional responsibilities apart from their general responsibility for the smooth
running of the London Transport system.
The operation of London’s transport is a vast undertaking. It serves an area of
nearly 2,000 square miles, extending for an average distance of 25 miles from
Charing Cross in the centre of London. It covers, in whole or in part, 10 counties,
the cities of London and Westminster, 27 other metropolitan boroughs, 2 county
boroughs, 48 municipal boroughs, 59 urban and 29 rural districts. The total
population of the area approaches 10 million.
From north to south the railway stretches 18 miles, from east to west 32 miles
and from north-west to east 49 miles. The total length of the railway over which
London Transport trains operate is 223 miles, of which just over a third is under¬
ground, including the longest tube tunnel in the world, 17J miles. There are 230
London Transport passenger stations.
Diesel buses travel over routes whose total length is 2,975 niiles, coaches over
665 miles, trolleybuses (which use electricity) 253 miles.
To carry traffic over all this area, the London Transport Executive in December
1953 owned 4,099 railway coaches, 8,466 buses and coaches, and i,797 trolleybuses.
The total staff employed at the end of 1953 was 94>6o5, °f whom 10,600 were
women. The total number of passenger journeys in 1953 was 4,238,128,000, or
about 11 -6 million every day.
1 During the year 1953 in the Metropolitan Police District, which covers the counties
of London and Middlesex and parts of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire, annual
licences were issued for 5,609 taxicabs ; licensed taxicab drivers numbered 9»°77 the
end of 1953. Taxicab fares are prescribed by the Home Secretary.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
207
To meet the challenge to the efficiency of London Transport presented by
growing traffic, plans have been put forward by the British Transport Commission
for extensive developments. These would cost approximately £340 million and take
20-30 years to complete. Among the recommendations are the construction of new
tubes, the electrification of steam suburban railways and the substitution of buses
for trams. A start on this plan has already been made by the removal, completed in
1952, of all London trams, and by some extensions to the underground railways.
THE ULSTER TRANSPORT AUTHORITY
Public inland transport in Northern Ireland, with the exception of passenger
transport in the City of Belfast, a section of the railway system previously owned by
the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland), and some small rail and road
transport undertakings, is owned and controlled by the Ulster Transport Authority
established under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland), 1948. The railway
system formerly operated by the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland) has
passed to a public body called the Great Northern Railway Board, established on
1st September 1953 by the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland Governments.
Before the 1948 Act was passed, all the railways in Northern Ireland were
separately owned and, from 1935, road transport (except for passenger transport
in Belfast City and certain types of specialized and ancillary freight haulage) was
under the control of the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board, a public under¬
taking formed to provide public transport services by road and to co-ordinate these
services with those of the railways. Now the Ulster Transport Authority operates
all the road services formerly provided by the Northern Ireland Road Transport
Board, together with the railway services provided before 1949 by the Northern
Counties Committee of the British Railways Executive and by the Belfast and
County Down Railway Company.
When the railway undertaking of the Northern Counties Committee was
acquired by the Ulster Transport Authority from the British Transport Commission
in 1949 it was agreed that each of the parties should co-operate with the other to
‘foster and encourage by all means in their power traffic and intercourse between
Great Britain on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the other and to . .. main¬
tain the principles of through rates and fares and facilities as between places in
Great Britain and places in Northern Ireland’.
The Ulster Transport Authority is a less complex organization than the British
Transport Commission and has no subsidiary Executives. The following figures
for the year ended September 1953 show the scope of its operations:
Railway track mileage . . . . broad gauge, 301 miles

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
CIVIL AVIATION
British civil aviation is now organized as follows:
1. Responsibility for its general development and supervision rests with the
Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.1
2. Scheduled public air transport services are reserved to the two Public Corpora¬
tions—British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European
Airways (BEA)—and their associates. Such services are those operated regu¬
larly or systematically between two places, one of which is in the United
Kingdom, for the transport of passengers, mail or cargo for remuneration, in
such a manner that each flight is open to use by members of the public.
3. Non-scheduled or charter flights are operated in the main by independent air
transport companies, although the Corporations undertake such flights as
opportunity offers with aircraft not required for their scheduled services at
any particular time. Some of these independent firms have large fleets of air¬
craft and many of them operate scheduled services as associates of one or other
of the Corporations.
Early Development
British airmen were the first to carry mails (at the time of the Coronation of
H.M. King George V in 1910) and the first to operate regular mail and passenger
services. The actual inauguration of civil air transport came on 25th August 1919,
when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow) and Paris
(Le Bourget) by a company called Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited. The
year 1919 was also marked by notable pioneer flights including the crossing of
the Atlantic by John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June (both were later
knighted for their achievement) and the first flight between England and Australia
by Captain (later Sir) Ross Smith and his crew in November.
In 1923 a Civil Air Transport Subsidies Committee recommended the merger of
the four existing small British companies into one organization capable of develop¬
ing oversea routes. In April 1924 the merger took place and there came into being
Imperial Airways Limited, which received a Government grant of £1 million
spread over the next 10 years. As a substantial shareholder the Government was
represented on the Board of Directors.
Imperial Airways Limited proceeded to pioneer the commercial development of
intercontinental air-routes, following up, in most cases, the exploratory work of the
Royal Air Force. Pioneering involved organizing the ground services upon which
civil aviation could rely. The route to the Far East came first. In 1927, a link was
established between Cairo and Basra and by 1929 there was a through service from
England to India. In 1931 the first service was established to Central Africa. The
first mail service between London and Australia was begun in December 1934,
followed by a passenger service in 1935.
In 1937 crossings of the Atlantic were made simultaneously by Imperial Airways
with the modified ‘Empire’ class flying-boat and by Pan American Airways. In
1939 a transatlantic service was operated by both companies. The British Overseas
Airways Corporation was established by the British Overseas Airways Act, 1939,
1 Up to 1945 civil aviation was administered by the Department of Civil Aviation of the
Air Ministry. Between 1945 and 1953 the Ministry of Civil Aviation was the responsible
Government Department. But, in October 1953, the Ministries of Civil Aviation and of
Transport were amalgamated. In the rest of this section, reference will usually be made
only to ‘the Minister’ or ‘the Ministry’.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
209
and took over the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways
Limited in 1940.
During the second world war the British Overseas Airways Corporation operated
essential oversea air services in support of the war effort. By the end of the war it
was carrying more than twice as many passengers as in 1939 and more than three
times as much freight. The routes were, moreover, left with efficient radio and
radar systems installed for war purposes which were adapted for civilian use. There
were also about 700 aerodromes in the United Kingdom, but most of them, having
been constructed for war purposes away from large towns, were unsuitably placed
for civil use.
The one serious obstacle to a continued expansion of British civil air transport
after the war was the absence of any new British civil aircraft to take the place of
the pre-war types. The British aircraft industry throughout the war had concen¬
trated entirely on the production of fighters and bombers for the Allied Forces,
leaving the production of all transport aircraft to the Americans. Since the evolu¬
tion of a new airliner takes anything from five to ten years, there was an awkward
gap in the natural development of British civil air services which could be filled
only by the use of uneconomical converted military types, or the purchase of foreign
aircraft. Both expedients together with the use of the highly successful interim
short-range Viking aircraft were, in fact, used while the British aircraft industry
concentrated on the development of the turbo-jet and turbo-prop airliners, e.g.,
Comets, Viscounts and Britannias.
The Corporations
As already noted, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was set up
in 1939. The Civil Aviation Act, 1946, set up two additional public corporations;
British European Airways (BEA) to cover the United Kingdom and Europe, and
British South American Airways (BSAA) to operate to South America and the
Caribbean, leaving the North Atlantic and Eastern Hemisphere routes to BOAC.
In 1949 BSAA was merged into BOAC by the Air Corporations Act of that year.
The statutory provisions (now laid down by the Air Corporations Act, 1949) relat¬
ing to their powers, constitution, etc., are as follows:
Operations. Scheduled services are reserved to the two Corporations, working
alone or through associates. They can also engage in charter work. They may not
manufacture airframes, aero-engines or propellers.
Constitution. Each Corporation consists of a chairman, deputy chairman and not
less than five or more than eleven directors. Appointments are made by the Minister
who, in the case of BOAC, may, if he wishes, appoint two deputy-chairmen.
Finance. Each Corporation may, with Treasury consent, borrow either by raising
temporary loans or by issuing stock to a maximum of £80 million in the case of
BOAC and £35 million in the case of BEA. The Treasury may guarantee redemp¬
tion or repayment of, and payment of interest on, any stock issued and temporary
loans raised. Provision is also made for Exchequer grants up to a limit of £8 million
a year (for both Corporations together) until April 1956, so as to enable the Corpora¬
tions to build up their organization and services over a period of years. (For
1946-47 and 1947-48 the maximum was £10 million.) The Corporations are not
exempt from liability for any taxes or rates.
Accounts. Statements of accounts in a form approved by the Minister and the
Treasury have to be prepared by the Corporations for each financial year. The
accounts are audited by auditors appointed annually by the Minister.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Annual Reports. Each Corporation must also make an annual report to the
Minister and the Minister must lay a copy of this report and of the accounts before
each House of Parliament. In addition, each Corporation must submit before the
beginning of every planning period (each three-year period beginning ist April
1947) a programme of the services it proposes to provide and of any other activities
it proposes to engage in as well as an estimate of its receipts and expenditure on
revenue and capital account during the period.
Labour Relations. Each Corporation must, unless it is satisfied that adequate
machinery already exists, consult with any organization which it considers appro¬
priate with a view to establishing machinery for settling terms and conditions of
employment and for discussing matters affecting the safety, health and welfare of
its employees and other matters of interest to both parties, including efficiency in
operating the Corporation's services. In 1946 the National yoint Council for Civil
Air Transport was set up as the body through which terms and conditions of service
between the Corporations and the 18 Trade Unions representing the employees
are negotiated. A number of the independent air transport companies have since
become members of the Council.
Ministerial Control. The Corporations conduct their own affairs as commercial
businesses. The Minister can give general directions on matters affecting the
national interest but in practice this power is rarely, if ever, used, since it has been
found much more suitable to proceed by means of close consultation and discussion
with the Corporations. In fact, the Minister has maintained closer control over them
than has been the case for the other nationalized industries. This has largely been the
consequence of the payment of subsidy to the Corporations through the Exchequer
grants, since this has meant that the Minister has had to discharge a considerable
responsibility for their general efficiency. He has to decide in consultation with the
Treasury what grants, within the ceiling of £8 million, should be given to each
Corporation in any particular year. This necessitates a close examination of the
Corporations’ programmes of air services and estimates. The Minister also keeps in
close touch with the Corporations regarding plans for new aircraft and new routes
since he has to negotiate the necessary rights with foreign governments. He also
provides most of the aerodromes from which the Corporations operate and the
navigational aids and communications necessary to the conduct of their flights.
Contact between the Corporations and the Ministry is, therefore, close, mainly in
the form of daily informal exchanges of information between their staffs.
Independent Companies
The Government considers that non-scheduled or charter services are mainly the
domain of the independent companies. The Corporations are not precluded from
engaging in this work but they do not maintain aircraft specially for it. The opera¬
tion of scheduled services by independent companies under associate agreements
with the Corporations was introduced in 1948. Applications to operate these services
were considered by the Air Transport Advisory Council (see p. 216), which recom¬
mended to the Minister whether or not approval should be given. In the main,
agreements were of short duration, the routes being those which the Corporations
did not, at the time, plan to operate, e.g., some internal routes, short-haul ferry
services across the English Channel and a few holiday routes to the Continent.
The opportunities for independent companies to take part in air transport
developments were increased in 1952. In May of that year the Ministry outlined
the principles which would be followed in shaping the Government’s policy for
air transport development. These were broadly to combine public and private
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
211
enterprise in the best interests of British civil aviation; and to promote sound
development, reduce the cost to the taxpayer and give greater opportunities to
private enterprise without impairing the competitive strength of Britain’s inter¬
national services and without undermining the existing international networks of
BOAC and BEA. This policy is being implemented within the existing legislation
so that independent companies seeking to take advantage of new opportunities
to operate scheduled services continue to be appointed associates of one of the
Corporations.
Applications by independent companies continue to be made to the Air Transport
Advisory Council but are considered under new terms of reference issued to the
Council in July 1952. Under these terms of reference, the Corporations’ position is
safeguarded by reserving to them the sole right to operate standard and tourist
class services on their own routes. Independent companies and the Corporations
alike, however, are eligible to apply for the right to develop new routes not so
reserved and new types of scheduled services: for example, national services which
do not materially divert traffic from BEA or independent companies already
approved, all-freight services which do not affect the services of established
operators, and ‘Colonial Coach Class’ services to any point in the United Kingdom
dependencies which generate a new class of traffic by providing a lower class of
service than a normal scheduled service.
The Air Transport Advisory Council considers applications in the light of its
terms of reference and, after hearing evidence from interested parties, makes
recommendations to the Minister. Approval of the operations of scheduled
services by independent companies as associates of the Corporations is now
normally valid for seven years with extension to ten years in special circumstances,
for example, where the purchase of new aircraft is involved. In this way, it is
intended to give independent companies sufficient long-term security to justify
capital outlay and expansion.
Operations
The latest available information about the services, fleets and results of the two
Corporations, and the activities of the independent companies are summarized
below.
British Overseas Airways Corporation
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operates services to the
Middle and Far East and to Australia, with terminals at Sydney, Tokyo, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Bahrein, Tel Aviv, Tripoli and Aden; to Africa with
terminals at Johannesburg, Salisbury, Nairobi, Cairo, Accra/Lagos and Dar es
Salaam; and to North and South America and the Caribbean with terminals at New
York, Montreal, Santiago, Jamaica and Trinidad. In April 1954 operation of routes
to South America was temporarily interrupted because of a shortage of aircraft
resulting from the decision to discontinue Comet services pending a full investiga¬
tion into recent accidents which had involved the loss of two aircraft of that type.1
As extensions to the London-New York route there are services between New
York and Bermuda, Nassau and Montego Bay. The routes to Central and South
Africa are operated in co-operation with Central African Airways and in partner¬
ship with South African Airways, and the route to Sydney in partnership with
1 A public inquiry into the cause of the loss of the two Comet airliners, on 10th January
and 8th April 1954, was opened in London on 19th October 1954, when scientists of the
Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough advanced the view that the cause lay in a
sudden break-up of the pressurized cabin due to metal fatigue.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Qantas Empire Airways of Australia. Qantas carries on the service from Australia
by operating routes to North America—formerly operated by British Common¬
wealth Pacific Airlines which went out of existence on 31st March 1954—and it
will connect with the planned extension to San Francisco of BOAC’s North
American service. Tasman Empire Airways, jointly owned by the Australian and
New Zealand Governments, operates services between Australia and New Zealand
and from New Zealand to Fiji and other islands of the South Pacific.
This network of services (see end-paper maps) is supplemented by the activities
of subsidiary and associated enterprises overseas in which BOAC participates
financially or with which it has technical or management agreements.
Those in which BOAC has a controlling financial interest include Aden Airways
Ltd., which develops services in the Red Sea area; Bahamas Airways Ltd., provid¬
ing services linking the islands of the Bahamas with each other; British West Indian
Airways Ltd., providing services throughout the Caribbean area; and Gulf Aviation
Company Bahrein Ltd., which operates between Bahrein and nearby ports of call.
Those with which BOAC is associated either financially or through advisory and
other agreements include West African Airways Corporation and East African Air¬
ways Corporation, serving West and East Africa; Malayan Airways Ltd., which
operates services in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Brunei
and Sarawak and services between those territories and the Asian mainland;
Cyprus Airways Ltd.; and Iraqi Airways.
To implement its policy of extending the benefits of air travel to a wider public
by charging lower fares, BOAC has introduced tourist services on many routes and
by the end of March 1954, 35 per cent of BOAC’s available seat mileage was offered
at tourist fares.
On all its services, BOAC carried, in 1953-54, 304,980 passengers, 5,409 tons
of freight and 3,366 tons of mail. The figures in 1947-48 were 115,678 passengers,
2,447 tons of freight and 2,088 tons of mail. •
During 1953-54 the progressive introduction of the Comet I enabled the Hermes
to be withdrawn from service so that at 31st March 1954 BOAC’s fleet consisted
of 22 Argonauts, 7 Comets, 11 Constellations, 10 Stratocruisers and 4 Yor& freighters.
When the Comet I (with which the world’s first scheduled jet service was started
on 2nd May 1952) was withdrawn from service on 9th April 1954, BOAC lost
21 per cent of its planned capacity for 1954-55, and as a temporary stop-gap is
arranging to acquire some additional American piston-engined aircraft. But
BOAC retains its faith in the future of jet-propelled aircraft and has on order
Comet IIs and Ills to the value of £15 million. The prototype of the Comet III—
intended for the North American service—made its first flight on 19th July
I954, ,, • r
In the year 1951-52 BOAC for the first time made a net profit after allowing for
interest on capital and before crediting the Exchequer grant of million. In
1952-53, when the profit (before providing for interest on capital) was reduced
from £1-2 million to £104,000 mainly owing to an increase in costs—including
increased wage rates and costs of materials, spares and fuel—BOAC abstained
from claiming any Exchequer grant and the deficit remaining after paying interest
on capital was carried forward. In 1953-54 the profit was £2 million, and after
paying interest on capital and providing for future income tax and profits tax,
there remained a balance of £936,911 to be applied to the reduction of the
accumulated deficiency.
Over the whole seven-year period up to the end of March 1954, the capacity on
BOAC services increased from 89-5 million to 220-5 million ton miles; operating
revenue increased from £14-6 million to £38-3 million; operating costs were
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
213
reduced from 56-6 pence per ton mile to 40-1 pence; and the break-even load factor
(the proportion of aircraft space it is necessary to sell in order to cover all costs of
operation and administration including interest on capital) fell from 115 per cent
to 63 per cent.
British European Airways
British European Airways (BEA) is the seventh largest airline in the world
judged by annual number of passengers carried: 1,656,000 in 1953-54 when it
operated on its own behalf in conjunction with its associated companies and sub¬
sidiaries, a network of services covering 18,230 unduplicated route miles serving
26 airports in the United Kingdom and 40 airports in Europe and the Mediterranean
within a periphery on which the farthest points to the north, south, west and east
are Oslo, Cairo, Lisbon and Beirut. Its services within the United Kingdom include
a number which cannot be operated commercially with the equipment now avail¬
able but which meet a vital social need. These include services to the Highlands and
Islands of Scotland, winter services to the Isle of Man and inter-Channel Islands
services. Reduced tourist fares have been introduced on all BEA’s domestic routes
and on practically all its international routes. BEA maintains a close working
relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft of necessity fly through a number of
European stopping points on their way east and south. BEA also co-operates with
other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. In addition to passengers,
BEA carried 14,559 tons of freight and 6,582 tons of mail in the year 1953-54.
A subsidiary of BEA, Gibraltar Airways Ltd., operates services between Gibraltar
and Tangier. BEA is associated financially with Aer Lingus Teoranta, working
primarily between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom; Aerolinee Italiane
Internazionali {Alitalia) which operates services within Europe and also to East
Africa, the Middle East and South America; Cyprus Airways Ltd., which operates
services to Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, North Africa, the
Sudan and the Persian Gulf; and Malta Airways Company Ltd. BEA is also associ¬
ated with Societe Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautiques {SITA), a
Belgian company which provides communications circuits for subscribing operators;
and, like BOAC, with International Aeradio Ltd. (see p. 219).
BEA’s operational fleet on 19th October 1954 comprised 21 Viscounts V701
(another 5 are on order), 20 Elizabethans, 18 Vikings (‘Admiral’ class, the rest of
the Viking fleet has been withdrawn), 38 Pionairs (Douglas DC3, used on domestic
routes), 8 Pionair-Leopard freighters, and 8 Islanders (DH89, used on local services
in the Channel Islands and the Outer Hebrides, and for ambulance service in
the Highlands and Islands of Scotland), and 5 helicopters.
The Viscount V701 ‘Discovery’ class was brought into regularly scheduled service
on 18th April 1953 on the routes to Istanbul and Cyprus, thus inaugurating the
world’s first commercial operations with propeller-turbine aircraft. Their use is
being extended, and a larger version of the Viscount, the V802, is on order.
Since 1950 BEA has operated various scheduled services with helicopters, in
order to obtain experience in the civil operation of helicopters which can be used
to assist the design and production of a commercial twin-engined British helicopter
and the development of navigational aids and ground facilities. To begin with, BEA
worked with the American type Sikorsky S.51 but towards the end of 1951 the first
British-built and designed helicopter suitable for scheduled flying, the Bristol 171,
became available and BEA took delivery of its first two in June 1953 after working
for a period with one lent to it by the Ministry of Supply. This, like the S.51,
is a single-engined helicopter. A twin-engined helicopter, the Bristol 173, is under
development but the version needed by BEA for the operation of the first network

of passenger services is not likely to be available for airline service for some years.
Two Bell 47s are used for training and experimental work.
As part of the process of obtaining experience, BEA opened a service on 15th
June 1954 with a Bristol 171 between Eastleigh Airport, Southampton and London
Airport. The service operates daily except Saturdays and Sundays. In June 1954
BEA was authorized by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation to buy two
Sikorsky 55 machines (twin-engined) which would be made in Britain and would
be used to start an experimental passenger service between London Airport and
the centre of London. A site on the South Bank of the Thames near County Hall
would be developed as an airstop and would be available for use by any helicopter
coming into the centre of London.
Over the period 1947-48 to 1953-54, BEA’s capacity increased from 22 million
to 84 million ton miles, operating revenue from £4 million to £14*7 million, operat¬
ing costs were reduced from 80-4 pence per ton mile to 47-5 pence, and the break¬
even load factor on operating costs fell from 115 per cent to 71-8 per cent. BEA is
faced with the problem of securing adequate revenue from short-haul routes
aggravated by a marked seasonal variation in its traffic.
In 1953-54 BEA earned for the first time a small operating surplus of £64,000,
but after providing for depreciation and increased aircraft amortization charges,
its net deficit was million, against which was set an Exchequer grant of
£1-5 million.
Independent Companies
The operation of scheduled services by independent companies as Associates of
the Corporations has been described above. In 1953 some 239,000 passengers were
carried on associate services compared with 55,000 in 1951 and 122,000 in
1952. In addition, as already mentioned, non-scheduled or charter operations are
regarded as mainly their province. They cover a wide range of business including
moving troops on government account; transporting to and from their place of
work personnel belonging to commercial and other companies operating overseas;
carrying livestock, including zoological specimens, machinery and other cargo;
taking parties to football matches and race meetings in Britain; taking parties on
trips or tours to oversea resorts; transporting, to and from the Hejaz, Mohammedans
making the Pilgrimage to Mecca; and bringing perishable foodstuffs and flowers
from the Continent to the United Kingdom market. There are also firms which
specialize in such activities as aerial photography and crop spraying.
The independent companies engaged in business of this kind operate a total of
about 195 twin-engined and 60 four-engined aircraft. A number of these companies
are members of the British Independent Air Transport Association Ltd. The larger
of them have subsidiary companies abroad and in some cases provide the manage¬
ment of small foreign airlines. Much charter business is now arranged through the
Air Section of the Baltic Exchange, the London market for shipping space. In this
market, business from any part of the world is handled between brokers represent¬
ing, on the one side, the owners of aircraft available for hire and, on the other, the
prospective shippers of cargo or organizers of passenger trips. Inquiries for the
charter of aircraft were first received on the Exchange as long ago as 1925 but it
was not until 1947 that an Air Section was formed. To assist the market, the Baltic
Exchange set up an air freight advisory committee but this was dissolved on
1 st February 1949 when the Airbrokers’ Association was formed. Among the
objects of the Association are to promote and establish uniformity in transactions
and usages in the airbroking trade, to establish in London a world market for
chartering aircraft to carry cargo and passengers, to represent the interests of its

members to Government Departments and other bodies, and to provide commer¬
cial arbitration machinery for the assistance of its members.
A recent development has been the increasing participation of shipping finance in
independent air companies: e.g., the Clan line has acquired a 50 per cent non¬
controlling interest in the Hunting Group, Furness Withy has acquired a substantial
interest in Ainvork Ltd., and an associate of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company, Ltd. (P and O) has acquired a majority shareholding in
another independent company, Britavia.
Powers and Duties of the Minister
The Civil Aviation Act of 1949, which superseded the 1946 Act, gives the
Minister the duty of ‘organizing, carrying out and encouraging measures for the
development of civil aviation, for the designing, development and production of
civil aircraft, for the promotion of safety and efficiency in the use thereof, and for
research into questions relating to air navigation’.
Under the heading ‘measures for the development of civil aviation’ come the
Minister’s relationship to the Corporations (as laid down in the Air Corporations
Act of 1949) and his general responsibility for carrying out policy; participation in
the International Civil Aviation Organization; responsibility, in concert with the
Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office, for dealing with other
countries in civil aviation matters; and the work of the Air Transport Advisory
Council. This body was established by the 1946 Act primarily to bring to the
Minister’s notice any important representations from the public about the adequacy
or otherwise of the services provided by the Corporations. It was also laid down
that its duties should include the study of any question related to the air transport
services which the Minister may refer to it. Under this provision, the Minister has
given the Council the task of considering and making recommendations to him on
applications from independent companies to operate scheduled services as associates
of one of the Corporations. This has, in fact, provided most of the Council’s work,
which has been increased following the new arrangements for permitting greater
participation by independent companies, announced in 1952 (see p. 210).
The Act requires that the chairman of the Council must be a lawyer and, of
its two to four members, at least one must be experienced in the operation of air
transport services and one in other forms of transport. The Council makes an
annual report to the Minister who lays it before Parliament.
The supervision of design, development and production of civil aircraft has been
delegated to the Ministry of Supply which is also responsible for the provision of
all Service aircraft and carries on an extensive programme of research and develop¬
ment to meet civil and Service needs. The Minister of Transport and Civil
Aviation is specifically debarred from ‘producing’ aircraft, and any dealings he
may have in aircraft, engines and equipment are subject to Treasury approval.
In exercising his responsibility for safety, the Minister regulates the operation of
aircraft and controls the licensing of flight crews. On all safety matters, the Minister
may call upon the advice of the Air Safety Board, a standing advisory body of
experts responsible to him for keeping under continuous review the needs of safety
in British civil aviation and for recommending measures calculated to promote
safety, in respect of both the operation of British civil aircraft throughout the world
and the efficiency of the system of ground facilities provided for all civil aircraft
operating over the United Kingdom.
On airworthiness matters the Minister is advised by the Air Registration Board
to which he has delegated certain functions relating to the design, construction
and maintenance of civil aircraft. The Board is a non-profit-making incorporated
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
217
body which was set up in February 1937 and consists of 18 members, 16 of
whom represent the interests concerned with civil aviation, and two who are
appointed by the Minister. The Board is responsible, inter alia, for the investiga¬
tion of aircraft for the purpose of making recommendations to the Minister for the
issue of Certificates of Airworthiness. Persons engaged in the maintenance of civil
aircraft must be the holders of appropriate licences issued by the Board or be
members of firms approved by the Board for the purpose.
The Minister is authorized (as are local authorities, subject to his approval)
to establish and maintain aerodromes for civil aviation. All civil aerodromes
not under the Minister’s direct control, which are used for hire or reward
passenger flying, are subject to his licensing, inspection and regulation.
The Minister is responsible for determining the conditions, e.g., use of aero¬
dromes and choice of routes, under which aircraft may fly within the United
Kingdom and of those under which passengers or cargo may be carried. He is also
responsible for various other matters, including the use of signals to and from air¬
craft; the prevention of interference, e.g., from displays of lights and signs from
shops, and with the effectiveness of navigational aids. The Minister is jointly
responsible with the Minister of Health for sanitary control at his aerodromes and
he also assists the appropriate Departments in the application of customs and
immigration regulations.
Aerodromes
There are approximately 100 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and, in
addition, about 50 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under civil
control include 30 directly controlled by the Ministry, 3 in the Channel Islands and
1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local governments, and 28 aerodromes
licensed for public use, of which 17 are owned by municipalities. Customs facilities
are provided at 17 of the Ministry’s aerodromes and at 9 others. The Ministry,
which provides the Colonial Office with advice on civil aviation matters, has also
assisted United Kingdom dependencies overseas in equipping and maintaining civil
aerodromes and necessary technical facilities to accepted international standards.
The main airports used by international scheduled services in I953~54 were:
for European services: London, Northolt, Renfrew, Birmingham (Elmdon),
Liverpool (Speke), Manchester (Ringway);
for North Atlantic services: London, Prestwick;
for South Atlantic, Middle East, Africa and Far East services: London.
Substantial increases in aircraft and passenger movements at the principal aero¬
dromes have continued from 1945 to 1953. In the latter year, all United Kingdom
aerodromes handled over 3 J million passengers. Of this total London Airport dealt
with 1,205,000 and Northolt 723,000. Outside the London area, Glasgow (Renfrew)
handled the largest number, 210,000; followed by Manchester (Ringway) 209,000;
Prestwick 187,000; Belfast (Nutt’s Corner) 167,000; and Isle of Man (Ronaldsway)
148,000. The number of movements of aircraft engaged on commercial transport
operations in 1953 was 213,563 for all United Kingdom aerodromes.
As the main alternate to London Airport, to be used when bad visibility involves
diversion and also as a base for seasonal services, it is proposed to develop Gatwick,
25 miles south of London, while Blackbushe, west of London, would be used as the
supplementary aerodrome to handle aircraft which for any reason could not use the
main alternate. Northolt was closed to civil flying on 30th October 1954- Prestwick
is being developed as the second international airport in the United Kingdom.
2l8
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Air Traffic Control
The main air traffic control centres are at Uxbridge for Southern England,
Preston for the North and Prestwick for Scotland and the Atlantic, while each
airport has its own traffic control unit.
An airliner flying into Britain comes first under the control of one of these centres.
It enters a Control Zone by one of the routes leading up to it, called National Air¬
ways. Each airway has a number of traffic lanes one above the other at intervals of
1,000 feet. The airliner must fly along one of these lanes at a height specified by
Control. This ensures that it can pass from the coast to the Control Zone at its
destination without any other aircraft being in that section of the airway at that
height at the same time. As the airliner reaches the Control Zone boundary, it is
passed to the airport control tower. It is brought to within a few miles of the airport
by the Approach Controller and then handed over to the Aerodrome Control for
landing and taxi-ing instructions.
Radar plays an important part in airport control, enabling aircraft to be brought
to the runway in close succession and enabling safe separation to be maintained
between arriving and departing aircraft. Even in bad weather a pilot can be brought
down to within sight of the runway by means of the radio and radar aids now
in use, such as the Ground Controlled Approach system (GCA), operated by a
mobile radar unit on the airport, which provides the control officer on the ground
with a picture of the aircraft’s position in the air, and the Instrument Landing
system (ILS), which operates an indicator in the pilot’s cockpit to guide him along
the correct course and angle of descent required for the approach. Meteorological
information is provided by the Meteorological Office of the Air Ministry.
Navigational Aids
Adequate radio navigational facilities are essential to enable aircraft to remain
safely within controlled airspace and to make accurate estimates of their times of
arrival.
During the next two or three years a number of very-high-frequency (VHF)
omni-directional radio ranges will be installed at strategic points in the country,
and this system may eventually replace many of the medium-frequency ranges and
radio beacons which now mark the airways. In addition, the coverage provided by
the three Decca ‘chains’ now operating in Britain will enable any aircraft fitted with
the appropriate receivers and automatic flight log to follow any of the air patterns
at present planned. The pilot of such an aircraft can obtain a ‘fix’ of his position by
the readings of two meters recording radio signals from ground stations of the
Decca Air and Marine Navigator System. The process of deriving the position
from the readings is unsuitable when a pilot is operating in air traffic control areas
of high density and so the flight log was evolved whereby the aircraft’s track and
position are presented continuously on a chart. Further improvements of the system
are being developed.
A vital part of the technical services provided by the Ministry is a network of
radio stations giving communication between ground and air. About fifty of these
stations, at aerodromes and other places, provide rapid and efficient communication
operating in the VHF band to aircraft in flight over and near the United Kingdom.
Special stations at Birdlip (Gloucestershire) and Prestwick, operating in the
high frequency (HE) band, maintain communication with aircraft on the long¬
distance routes such as the North Atlantic and South African routes. There is
also an extensive system of point-to-point communication between aerodromes
and air traffic control centres in the United Kingdom, and to places abroad.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Over this system are transmitted such messages as flight plans and weather, so vital
to safety and regularity. The main United Kingdom signals centre is at Croydon,
where an entirely new station, specially designed for the purpose, sends and receives
traffic over a network of teleprinter and radio circuits. The Croydon centre already
handles about 15,000 messages a day; its handling capacity is about 30,000
messages a day.
On routes outside the United Kingdom, British airline operators rely upon
ground organization provided by the countries over which they fly. In January 1947
the Airways Corporations (which at that time included BSAA) took the initiative in
forming a company, registered in the United Kingdom, called International Aeradio
Limited (IAL), for the purpose of helping countries in need of assistance in provid¬
ing radio communications, flying control and navigational facilities for civil avia¬
tion. Airlines of other countries have accepted invitations to become shareholders
and the membership is broadly representative of international civil aviation. IAL
operates by entering into contract with Governments to provide whatever degree of
assistance is required to enable States or Administrations to fulfil the international
obligations resting on them under the Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation for the
provision and maintenance of ground facilities for civil aviation. By 1952 Inter¬
national Aeradio Ltd. was carrying on functions of various kinds at 60 places in
32 oversea countries, and its network of radio and other facilities was being used
by over 200 operating companies.
The Air-Sea Search and Rescue Service, operated by the Royal Navy and the
Royal Air Force, is available to civil air operators within the United Kingdom area
and along the oversea routes wherever there are Royal Navy and RAF stations.
International and Commonwealth Co-operation
The United Kingdom actively supports the two principal agencies of international
co-operation in the field of civil aviation—the International Civil Aviation Organiza¬
tion (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
The United Kingdom has taken a leading part in drawing up ICAO’s standards
of air navigation practices and operating conditions and in applying them. It is also
a party to the ‘joint-support’ schemes by which ICAO seeks to ensure the adequacy
of air navigation facilities in certain areas. ICAO administers the facilities provided,
but their cost is shared between the States whose aircraft use them. Present schemes
concern installations in the North Atlantic region, and the United Kingdom
contribution includes the maintenance of ocean weather ships to supply meteoro¬
logical reports, give navigational aid and assist in search and rescue.
IATA is an association of international airlines operating scheduled services for
the transport of passengers, mail and cargo. BOAC, BEA and a few United
Kingdom independent companies are members. The main functions of IATA are
to reach agreement among its members on matters of common interest, to regulate
fares and freight rates, to facilitate through bookings, to standardize ticketing,
agency agreements, discounts and similar commercial matters. It collaborates with
ICAO where necessary.
International exchange of air traffic rights is the subject of agreement between
Governments. The United Kingdom Government has negotiated a series of bilateral
agreements providing for the reciprocal grant of traffic rights for scheduled services
with most of the countries to and through which the United Kingdom airlines
operate. So far as charter operations are concerned, the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment requires prior authorization for all flights on which passengers or freight are
picked up or set down by foreign aircraft in the United Kingdom. Such authoriza¬
tion may be granted on a reciprocal basis by inter-Governmental agreement or
220
Britain: an official handbook
permission may be given for each flight when application is made to the Ministry
by a foreign operator.
The progress and development of Commonwealth civil air communications, and
provision for the exchange of views and information between Commonwealth
countries and for giving advice to them are among the terms of reference of the
Commonwealth Air Transport Council (CATC). This is a consultative body, without
executive powers, which was set up in January 1945. The South Pacific Air Trans¬
port Council (SPATC) and the Southern Africa Air Transport Council (SAATC)
are subsidiary organizations of CATC. Their terms of reference so far as their areas
are concerned are similar to those of CATC in its wider sphere.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office with its staff of over 334,000 is a Government Department. It is
also the oldest of Britain’s nationalized undertakings. In 1649 a resolution in the
House of Commons declared that ‘the office of Postmaster is and ought to be in the
sole power and disposal of Parliament’.
The ministerial head of the Post Office is the Postmaster-General, who, with the
Assistant Postmaster-General, is responsible to Parliament for his Department. He
is subject to the overriding authority of Parliament and the Cabinet, and, on many
questions, of the Treasury. The Postmaster-General is chairman of the Post Office
Board, composed of the principal permanent officials of the Department, which
discusses and gives advice on matters of general policy, and he normally presides
over meetings of the Post Office Advisory Council, on which the principal users of
the Post Office services are represented.
Under the Postmaster-General, the permanent head of the Post Office is the
Director General, who is supported by three Deputy Directors General and an
Engineer-in-Chief. At the next level there are six Directors responsible respectively
for Posts, Inland Telecommunications, Radio and Accommodation, External
Telecommunications Executive, Establishments and Organization, and Personnel.
A Comptroller and Accountant General is responsible for the whole of the
accounting system and advises on financial matters. In addition, responsibility
for their several specialist functions rests with the Solicitor, the Public Relations
Officer, the Directors of Savings and of Contracts, and the Controllers of Supplies
and of Factories. The Post Office Headquarters is in St. Martin’s-le-Grand in
the City of London.
The six main divisions of work at Headquarters are carried down into the
organization of the ten regions—Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the
Border Counties, each under the control of a Director of the Post Office, and,
in England, the North West, the North East, the Midlands, the South West, the
Home Counties, and London (v/hich is divided into two functional regions, Postal
and Telecommunications), each under the control of a Regional Director. Each
Director and Regional Director is assisted by a deputy and six controllers. Under
the regional directors are 57 telephone managers, responsible in their respective
areas for all aspects of the telephone service, and 470 head postmasters, responsible
in their districts for posts and telegraphs, and (as agents for the telephone managers)
for local telephone service questions. Exceptionally, the head postmasters of
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester are in personal control, in
their districts, of all Post Office services: while in London there are 9 district
postmasters—with 2 divisional controllers responsible among other things for the
City itself—whose principal task it is to manage the postal services in the central
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
221
Metropolitan area. Altogether in the United Kingdom there are 472 head
post offices, 1,264 post offices, and 22,883 sub-offices, and 6,174 telephone ex¬
changes.
The staff at headquarters and in the regions is divided into two main groups:
general civil service grades (administrative, executive and clerical) and special
grades recruited directly by the Post Office for its engineering and operational
activities.
The work of the Post Office falls into two main categories: (1) direct services—
mail services, telecommunications, remittance and savings bank business; (2) agency
services—broadcasting services and business undertaken on behalf of other
Government Departments.
Mail Services
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from the time
when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern airmail
transport. In 1657, under the Protectorate of Cromwell, an Act was passed which
declared that ‘there shall be one general post-office and one officer, styled the
Postmaster-General of England and Comptroller of the Post Office’. The eighteenth
century saw a great expansion of the postal services with the introduction of mail-
coaches in 1784. Road surfaces were improved and the guards on mail-coaches
were postal servants with full responsibilities. In the first half of the nineteenth
century the Post Office was quick to take advantage of Britain’s vigorous period of
engineering and railway development, and the first dispatch of mails by train was
made in 1830 between Liverpool and Manchester.
The heavy charges, which were based upon the actual distance a letter was
carried, were among the factors which inspired Rowland Hill in his great work of
postal reform which led to the establishment of a uniform postage rate. In 1840
a uniform inland rate of postage of one penny per half-ounce payable in advance
came into operation—prepayment to be made by means of adhesive postage stamps.
Since the business world found cheap postage a boon and since it proved ultimately
a great financial success, it was imitated by almost every country in the world. In
1918 the basic penny rate for inland letters in Britain was raised to i|d. for four
ounces, and in 1920 to 2d. for three ounces. In 1922 it was changed to i|d. for
one ounce; in 1923 it was i^d. for two ounces; and in 1940 it was raised to 2^d.
for two ounces, where it now stands.
The inauguration of the penny post was followed by a rapid extension of the
scope of the postal services, beginning, in 1841, with the introduction of the
registered post to ensure additional safety for valuable mail. In 1854 Rowland Hill
became the permanent head of the Post Office, and it was during his term of office
that the Post Office Savings Bank was established, in 1861, to meet the needs of
the small investor. The money order system which had operated as a private
venture from 1792 to 1838 was supplemented in 1881 by the issue of postal orders
for fixed amounts. Letter-boxes had been instituted in London in 1855 to facilitate
the increased postal traffic, and in 1883 the parcel post was introduced. By the end
of the nineteenth century a regular delivery of letters was assured to every house
in Britain.
The guiding principles of the postal services—speed, reliability and economy—
have motivated all developments in the history of the Post Office. Improvements
include the provision of motor mail van services linking rural districts, postal
sorting carriages on the railways, special mail trains on certain routes and the
ingenious apparatus by which bags of mail are delivered and collected by trains
running at express speed. During the second world war many of these facilities had
222
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to be curtailed and some were suspended, manpower shortage created a serious
problem and oversea mails were disrupted.
Since 1945 the Post Office has restored and developed most of the pre-war
services, and to the heavy task of reconstruction has been added a marked increase
in the volume of mail. In the 15 years from 1938-39 to i953-54 the parcel post
increased from 185 million items to nearly 242 million, registered postal traffic
from 62 million to 131 million and posted correspondence from 8,240 million to
9,100 million.
The minimum rates for letters sent by surface mails are: inland and Irish
Republic, 2id. for two ounces; British Commonwealth, territories under British
Trusteeship, British Post Offices in Morocco and the Persian Gulf, Her Majesty’s
Forces overseas and Her Majesty’s ships in foreign waters, and also Burma, Egypt,
Israel, Jordan, United States, 2jd. for one ounce; other foreign countries, 4d.
for one ounce. The inland parcel rate is is. id. for parcels weighing up to 2 lb.
ranging to 2s. 4d. for 15 lb. The rates for parcels sent to the Irish Republic range
from is. id. for parcels weighing up to 2 lb. to 2s. 6d. for 15 lb. The oversea parcel
rates vary according to the destination.
There are lower rates for second-class mail (unsealed packets containing printed
matter, newspapers, periodicals, commercial papers, samples and small consign¬
ments of merchandise).
Packages containing literature for the blind can be sent to destinations in the
United Kingdom and Irish Republic at a nominal rate ranging from |d. to 2|d. for
the maximum weight of 15 lb. and to oversea destinations, by surface mail, post
free.
Airmail Services
Railways and motors as a means of transport for mails are supplemented by
steamers and aeroplanes. The figures for the year ended March 1954 show that
total oversea civilian correspondence amounted to 384 million items and Forces’
mail to 58 million, and that nearly 51 per cent of this traffic now travels by air.
First-class mail to all European countries is sent by air or by surface transport,
whichever offers the speedier delivery, without payment of any special air fee.
The Post Office dispatches nearly 26 tons of letter mail a week to European
destinations by this ‘all-up’ service mainly in aircraft of the British European
Airways, whose network of services enables many of the letters posted in London
for Europe to be delivered the following day. The air parcel service to Europe,
introduced on 2nd April 1949, was operating to 25 destinations1 by the autumn
of that year, and now about six tons of parcel mail are dispatched weekly to
Europe by air.
First-class mail and second-class mail are dispatched by air to countries outside
Europe upon payment of special airmail rates of postage. The airmail postage rates
for letters are gd., is. 3d. and is. 6d. per \ ounce, depending on the destination.
Air parcel services are also available to more than 100 countries outside Europe.
Light-weight air letters costing 6d. each are popular and some 43 million were
posted in the year ended March 1954.
Telegraphs
All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of
the Postmaster-General in 1870. Teleprinter working for the transmission of
inland telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the present
1 Spain and the Balearic Islands are considered as a single destination.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
223
automatic switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now one of the most
up-to-date systems in the world and gives direct connection between any of the
450 larger telegraph offices. The Post Office accepted 34 million inland telegrams
in I953_54) and the average time between handing in an inland telegram and its
receipt at the delivery office was 23 minutes compared with 48 minutes in 1946.
In recent years inland telegraph traffic has decreased while the costs of running
the service have increased. In 1954 the charges for inland telegrams were raised
to 3s. for 12 words and 3d. for each additional word.
Telephones
There are 6,174 telephone exchanges in the United Kingdom, of which 4,500
are automatic exchanges. During the year ended 31st March 1954 approximately
700,000 new telephones were provided for subscribers, bringing the total number
of telephones to 6,i47>000> of which 74 Per cent were connected to automatic
exchanges. During the same period the number of people waiting for telephones
was reduced to 376,000 from 427,000. In addition, there are over 65,000 telephone
kiosks for public use. The net increase in the number of telephones since the war
has been about 2-2 million, although during that period over 4-5 million new
telephones were installed. This post-war installation work has been achieved in
spite of the priority given to the export of telecommunication equipment. The
level of telephone traffic continues high. In the year ended 31st March 1939 the
total of trunk and toll calls was 112 million, while in the year ended 31st March
1954 the Post Office handled a total of 278 million; 70 million of these were at the
cheap night rate, which was instituted in 1934. To meet this increasing traffic,
about 11,000 trunk circuits over 25 miles in radial length have been provided since
the end of the second world war, making a total of over 20,000 circuits. In the year
ended 31st March 1954, 3,370 million local calls were handled, an increase of
63 per cent compared with the year 1938-39. About 400 exchanges now operate
the automatic time service, first introduced in 1936, by which callers in 26 cities
and towns are able to obtain the correct time automatically by dialling the three-
letter code TIM or a figure code which connects to the speaking clock at Holborn
Exchange, London, or to a similar clock in Liverpool.
The 999 emergency dialling service is available on over 2,200 of the 4,500 auto¬
matic exchanges now in service. Callers using this service are given priority of
answer and are connected as quickly as possible to the police, ambulance or fire
brigade, and in certain coastal districts to lifeboat and coastguard stations.
Oversea Telecommunications
All the oversea telephone services from the United Kingdom have, for a great
many years, been developed and operated by the Post Office. The oversea telegraph
services, on the other hand, were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and
Cable and Wireless Ltd. This Company, which was brought into public owner¬
ship on 1 st January 1947, had developed a large and valuable telegraph cable
network (some 150,000 nautical miles of submarine cable) of world-wide extent,
to which it added considerable radio facilities. It operated not only in the United
Kingdom, but in most parts of the Commonwealth as well as in some foreign
countries. In 1950 the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa, India and Southern Rhodesia took over the operation
of the oversea telegraph services in their own countries, leaving the Company with
its cable network and with the operation of the network in some Colonial and
foreign territories. Thus the Post Office operates all oversea telecommunications
from the United Kingdom.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
224
The oversea telegraph, telex and telephone services are operated under the
general title of Post Office Cable and Wireless Services and through five London
stations having international circuits:
Telegraphs. Most of the European telegraph services are worked from the
Central Telegraph Office in St. Martin’s-le-Grand, London, from which there
are direct circuits to most European countries. The extra-European services
together with some services to Europe are operated from Electra House, Victoria
Embankment, London. In all, the Post Office transmitted 19 million telegrams
to countries abroad and received a similar number for delivery in Britain in
the year ended 31st March 1954*
Telex. The International Telex Exchange, in the Central Telegraph Office,
St. Martin’s-le-Grand, provides a teleprinter service to 19 countries abroad. In
November 1954 the separate international and inland services were amalgamated
and the number of subscribers having access to the international service increased
from 700 to 1,700. At that time some 16,000 outgoing calls were being made
each week and a similar number of calls were being received.
Telephones. Telephone service to European countries is through the Conti¬
nental Exchange from which direct telephone circuits radiate to 17 continental
countries. These circuits, over which calls can be connected to almost every
country in Europe, are also used to send and receive pictures and to relay
speech and music for broadcast transmissions. In i953~54 nearly if million
outgoing calls were made. Extra-European services are connected through
the International Radio Exchange over radio circuits which provide service
with most countries outside Europe and with many of the larger liners at sea.
The number of outgoing radio calls made in 1953-54 was 85,000.
Work has started on the first transatlantic telephone cable. This is jointly under¬
taken by the Post Office, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the
Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation and the Eastern Telephone
and Telegraph Company of Canada, to improve and expand communications
between the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. It is expected to
be completed by the end of 1956. The Post Office cable ship, H.M.T.S. Monarch,
will lay the cable, most of which is being made in the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom is a member of the International Telecommunications
Union which has its headquarters at Geneva in Switzerland, and which is the
co-ordinating body for telecommunications throughout the world.
Ship-Shore Radiocommunications
In addition to the radio stations for oversea telecommunications, the Post Office
has 11 coast radio stations situated in the United Kingdom. These stations provide
for radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at ranges
up to 300 miles approximately. There is also a long-distance station at Burnham-on-
Sea, which communicates with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with safety
of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radiotelegraph and
radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or aircraft and take imme¬
diate action, by radio and by advising the appropriate shore authorities, to obtain
assistance for any vessel in distress. During the year ended 31st March 1954 the
stations handled 240 cases of casualties to shipping and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange radio-
telegrams with ships, connect radiotelephone calls between telephone subscribers
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 225
ashore and suitably equipped ships, broadcast navigational warnings and weather
bulletins, and operate direction-finding services for ships. During the year ended
31st March 1954 the stations handled 853,000 radiotelegrams and 48,000 radio¬
telephone calls, they broadcast 1,700 navigational warnings and over 10,000
weather reports; and they gave 1,200 radio bearings to ships.
The stations also operate a medical advice service whereby the Master of a ship
may obtain advice on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard
ship. The service is a free one. During 1954 the stations dealt with 148 requests for
medical advice.
The Post Office Counter: Agency and Direct Services
Largely as a result of the extension of social legislation and the widening scope of
the social services, the volume of work measured on a time basis at post office
counters has increased considerably compared with the total for 1938-39. In the
15 years to 1953-54 the cash turnover increased from just over £1,000 million to
£3,810 million.
At the post office counter the citizen can draw his pension and his family allow¬
ance, buy a licence for his gun, dog, sound radio or television receiving set, renew
his car licence, buy stamps for National Insurance (see p. 295) or for National
Savings certificates (see p. 257) snd bank his savings. In these and many similar
transactions the Post Office acts as an agent for other Government Departments
and for the BBC. Of the 47 million postal drafts paid out by the Post Office in
I953-54> 34 million were in payment of sickness benefits under the National
Insurance Scheme; at the end of November 1954 current broadcast receiving
licences in the United Kingdom issued by the Post Office totalled 13,794,195, of
which 3,999,624 were for television sets (see also p. 368).
Counter sales include also an increasing volume of direct Post Office business:
during the year ended 3Ist March 1954 about 594 million postal orders were
issued by post offices, an increase of over 27 million on the previous year’s record
figure.
For over ninety years the Post Office Savings Bank (see p. 257) has supported
the financial stability of Britain and the well-being of its citizens. Approximately
one out of every two persons in Britain has a savings account or other holding
with the Post Office, and active savings bank accounts at the end of 1953 numbered
over 22 million.
Y11. LABOUR AND
MANAGEMENT
MANPOWER
The total working population1 of the United Kingdom at the end of June 1954
was just over 24 million, some 47 per cent of the total population, and included
about 70 per cent of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for women,
15 years to 64 years for men). In fact, about 95 per cent of British men of working
age are today in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 5 per cent consist mainly
of those continuing their education, of the severely disabled and of some persons
of private means. The proportion of women of working age in or seeking gainful
work is much lower, about 45 per cent, as many housewives have no wish to take
employment outside the home, or if they have, are prevented by household duties
from doing so. Besides those of normal working age, there are about a million older
men and women still at work. The great majority of the working population work
for a wage or salary, but about 1 £ million are employers or self-employed.
The make-up of the working population has been affected during the century by
decreases in both birth and death rates, the result of which has been that the
proportion of both the total population and the working population over the age of
35 has increased considerably. Changes in social habits have also had their effect.
The minimum working age has been raised to 15 years. The proportion of those
over the normal working age who are occupied has declined (though the great
increase in the number of older persons has meant that the actual number who are
working has increased). The proportion of men aged 20 to 64 who are at work has
remained high and fairly uniform. Among women, on the other hand, there has
been a steady increase during the century in the proportions employed in the age
group 15 to 59, but this has been offset by a decrease in the proportion of women
employed above the age of 59 and by the raising of the minimum working age.
There has been a considerable increase in the employment of married women
during the same period, most noticeably in the last twenty years.
The proportion of women at work is generally higher for single than for married
women of the same age and for younger as compared with older women of the same
marital status. Thus only 16 per cent of married women aged 55 to 59 are at work
compared with 37 per cent of married women aged 20 to 24. The majority of the
female labour force is under 35 years of age, though an increasing number of
middle-aged women have recently been taking work, including part-time work.
The total working population is now higher than before the war, but probably
lower than during the middle of hostilities when housewives, including mothers of
young children, manned war factories at great personal inconvenience, while men
served in the armed forces. From the end of the war until mid-1947 the size of the
working population declined as women left industry. At the same time the expan¬
sion of the population of working age, a feature of the British economy for two
^he total working population represents the estimated total number of persons aged
15 and over who work for pay or gain, or register themselves as available for such work.
The total comprises the armed forces, men and women on release leave not yet in employ¬
ment, all persons—employers and workers on their own account as well as employees in
civil employment (including persons temporarily laid off but still on the employers pay¬
rolls) and wholly unemployed persons registered for employment. Part-time workers are
counted as full units.

centuries, slowed down, largely as a result of the low birth rates of the 1930s, and
in the case of women it actually halted. Further, the raising of the school-leaving
age in 1947 removed the 14 age group from the working population. However, after
remaining fairly steady from mid-1948 to mid-1949, the total working population
rose from mid-1949 the end of 1951) if allowance is made for seasonal variations.
Among the reasons for this rise were the continued increase in the number of men
in the working age groups and the return of a number of women to part-time or
whole-time work. The working population at the end of 1952 was slightly smaller
than at the end of 1951, but during 1953 and the first half of 1954 it resumed its
steady rise.
The broad changes in the manpower position in Great Britain between mid-1948
and mid-1954 are shown in Table 34.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Deployment of Labour
Nearly 45 per cent of those in civil employment are employed in the mining and
manufacturing industries and only about 5 Per cent in agriculture and fishing. Over
half of those in manufacturing are in the metals, engineering, vehicles and chemicals
groups of industries, in which the total labour force has approximately doubled in
the last 20 years.
Most industries employ women as well as men, but there are jobs, such as under¬
ground work in coal mines, which are forbidden to women. The industrial groups
in which women are chiefly employed are in the manufacture of textiles, clothing,
and food, drink and tobacco, and in the distributive trades and professional and
miscellaneous services.
An analysis of the total number in civil employment by broad industrial groups is
given in Table 35.

The 1951 Census One Per Cent Sample Tables (see page 5) showed that less
than a third of men at work and less than a quarter of women at work were em¬
ployed in manual occupations in mining or manufacturing industry. On the other
hand, there were in Great Britain at the time of the 1951 Census of Population over
1,400,000 women clerical workers (including typists), over 800,000 in retail trade,
230
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
over 1,000,000 women domestic workers or charwomen (including those in hotels,
institutions and offices), 500,000 women in various other forms of personal service,
including catering, nearly a quarter of a million nurses, and 220,000 women
teachers.
In June 1954 the unemployed constituted 1.1 per cent of insured employees in
Great Britain. Unemployment was mainly short-term. The total number of persons
unemployed for more than six months in Great Britain was about 0-3 percent of the
number of insured employees. About one-third of these long-term unemployed
were men and women over 4° years of age in certain areas where unemployment
had been especially severe between 1921 and 1939-
Unemployment in all areas has been very greatly reduced since the pre-war
years, both because of changes in the general economic situation and because of
specific measures taken by the Government to promote a balanced distribution of
industry in order to prevent the recurrence of severe unemployment in the areas
previously most seriously affected (see p. 117).
Considerable changes in the distribution of persons between various industries
and occupations have taken place during the twentieth century. Some short-term
changes were brought about by the two world wars and by the severe trade reces¬
sion and unemployment of the inter-war years, but the following appear to be the
main long-term trends:
(1) A continuance at a decreasing rate of the decline in agricultural employment
which was rapid at the end of the nineteenth century.
(2) A general increase in administrative and clerical employment, including
public administration, and a very large increase in the employment of women
in clerical work, including typing.
(3) A decline in employment in certain large old-established industries, notably
coalmining and cotton textiles.
(4) A very large increase in employment in the metals, engineering and vehicles
group of industries and the chemicals group of industries. Employment in
these industries approximately doubled between 1931 and 1951. Expansion
has been most marked in those sections of the industries making relatively
new types of products, e.g., cars, aircraft, electrical and electronic apparatus
and plastics. The rate of increase in certain branches of these industries was
accelerated during both world wars.
(5) A decline in indoor private domestic service in which the number of women
employed has fallen by about a million since 1900-
(6) A considerable increase in the numbers employed in the distributive trades.
This trend was reversed during both world wars—e.g., the number in the
distributive trades fell by 930,000 during the last war, and although increas¬
ing is still below the 1939 level—but appears to be fairly continuous in time
of peace.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The provision of employment services has been one of the principal functions of
the Ministry of Labour and National Service since its inception in 1916. Their
scope has gradually been extended to include the provision of vocational guidance,
and, in suitable cases, of vocational training. The Employment and Training Act,
1948, provided a permanent legislative basis for these wider services. The main
services are provided through the country-wide network of some 1,200 local
LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT
231
Employment and Branch Employment Offices. A small number of special offices
deal wholly or mainly with particular types of workers, e.g., dockers and persons
employed in the catering trades. Local Employment Committees, composed of
representatives of employers, workers and other local interests, are attached to
most Employment Exchanges as advisory bodies to secure for the Department the
full benefit of local knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers.
In addition, an Appointments Service, intended to meet the needs of men and
women who are qualified, or who are likely to qualify, for professional, adminis¬
trative, managerial, senior executive and higher technical and scientific posts at
home and overseas, is operated by the following offices in Great Britain staffed by
officials of the Ministry of Labour and National Service:
(1) The Technical and Scientific Register, kept centrally in London, which deals
with professionally qualified scientists, engineers, architects and surveyors.
(2) Regional Nursing Appointments Offices (11) and Nursing Appointments
Offices (140), which deal with recruitment for training and employment in
nursing, midwifery, radiography, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and
medical laboratory technical work.
(3) Appointments Offices (3) which deal with all other persons qualified for pro¬
fessional and higher technical posts; senior executives; ex-regular officers of
the armed forces; and young men suitable for training for management in
industry and commerce.
In normal times there is no compulsion on any job-seeker or on any employer
requiring labour to use these Government services. Since 25th February 1952,
however, a Statutory Order, the Notification of Vacancies Order, 1952, has obliged
employers to recruit most types of ordinary labour through local offices of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service or through employment agencies regis¬
tered with the Ministry. The main object of this Order, which is flexible in its
application and permits many personal and occupational exceptions, is to give
employment officers every chance to persuade job-seekers to undertake work of
national importance, e.g., in defence or in the basic industries. This Order does
not give the Ministry any power to direct labour.
General Services for Adults
Local offices and offices of the Appointments Service accept on their registers
both employed and unemployed persons seeking employment. Their primary
function is to introduce suitable persons seeking employment to employers requir¬
ing employees, thus providing an efficient service to employers and job-seekers and
meeting the needs of the national economy.
The appointments offices also operate a scheme for financing short business
courses for suitable ex-regular Service men and women, and provide a Careers
Advice Service for suitably qualified men and women of 18 years of age and over
on the choice of a career. This service is particularly valuable to young graduates
and other suitable young men and women, including those who have just finished
a period of service with the armed forces.
A special responsibility of the local offices is recruitment under the Vocational
Training Schemes. Two of these schemes—that for the disabled and that for men
and women who need this kind of help if they are to obtain suitable employment
after a voluntary period of service in the regular armed forces—are directed to the
resettlement of the individual and cover a comprehensive range of skilled trades
from agriculture to watch and clock repair, from radio servicing to clerical work.
Unemployed men and women have also been recruited for this wide range of
Q
232
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
trades in some circumstances. The third Vocational Training Scheme is directed to
the filling of urgent vacancies in industries which are important to the national
economy and which at the same time suffer from shortages of skilled labour. Any
suitable man or woman without an employable skill is recruited under this scheme,
which includes 20 to 30 skilled courses including agriculture, engineering and
draughtsmanship.
Training under all these schemes is given mainly at Government Training
Centres, of which there are 16 in different parts of the country, and for some trades
in technical colleges or in an employer’s establishment. Courses last normally for
six months. Maintenance allowances are paid during training, and men and women
with dependants receive higher rates. These maintenance allowances are higher
than the rate for unemployment benefit. During the period from the beginning of
the post-war training scheme on 2nd July 1945 to 5th July 1954 the number of
trainees placed in employment was 115,809.
Training schemes for particular groups of crafts have been drawn up in consulta¬
tion with representatives of employers and workers, who have agreed that trainees
should be accepted in industry for work which makes full use of the knowledge
acquired during the course. In trades where it is usual for the employee to provide
his own tools he is given these free on taking up a job in his training trade. The job
itself is found whenever possible by the Employment Exchange (local office).
The Ministry of Labour and National Service sponsors as a free service to
industry the Training Within Industry for Supervisors scheme which gives training
to supervisors in three essential skills, i.e. in instructing and passing on informa¬
tion, in leading and fostering harmonious working relationships, and in improving
working methods. The Ministry is prepared to extend a measure of these services
to oversea branches of British firms. It is prepared also to train suitable persons to
develop the scheme in their own territories. The arrangements may be made by the
Government of the country concerned or (where appropriate) by the International
Labour Organization.
Services for Foreigners
Foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment with a
particular employer, provided they are in possession of a permit issued to the
prospective employer by the Ministry of Labour and National Service (the Ministry
of Labour and National Insurance for Northern Ireland if the proposed employment
is in Northern Ireland). Employment is limited to a maximum of one year in the
first instance but may be extended on application by the employer. If a foreigner
already landed in Great Britain, for example as a visitor, seeks to enter employment,
his prospective employer must obtain prior approval from the Ministry of Labour
and National Service. Approval is subject to the same conditions and requirements
as are applied to the grant of permits to foreigners while still abroad.
The general conditions which must be satisfied before a permit is granted are:
that the proposed employment of a foreigner is reasonable and necessary in the
circumstances; that adequate efforts have been made by the employer to find suit¬
able labour from among British subjects (or foreigners long resident in the United
Kingdom); and that the wages and conditions of employment proposed for the
foreigners are not less favourable than those commonly accorded to British
employees for similar work in the district concerned.
In considering applications for permits, various other factors must be considered
according to the nature of the proposed employment. Special arrangements have
been applied to the admission of foreigners for nursing, teaching, various forms of
entertainment, and in particular industries. In principle, permits for unskilled
LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT
233
workers in industry are only granted in those industries which are particularly
important to the national economy and where there is a general shortage of labour.
To encourage visits and exchanges of young workers between Britain and other
countries, applications from prospective employers for permits for student
employees are granted freely under properly sponsored arrangements, organized
mostly through unofficial channels.
A foreigner who has been allowed to take employment under a permit, or by
the approval of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, may not change
his employment, unless his prospective employer has obtained prior approval
from the Ministry to employ the foreigner. From May 1946 to the end of 1953,
239,501 permits were granted, of which 150,711 were for resident domestic servants
in hospitals, schools, other institutions and private households, and 20,165 for
student employees.
The permit system applies to individual aliens. After the second world war, far
greater numbers were being admitted under various group schemes organized by
the Ministry of Labour and National Service.
There were two main group schemes for the employment of alien labour. The
first was the Polish Resettlement Corps, established in 1946 to resettle those
members of the Polish Forces who felt themselves unable to return to post-war
Poland. Three years later, when the Corps was disbanded, practically all the 114,000
Poles who had been its members were re-settled. Of these, almost 100,000 had
chosen to remain in the United Kingdom, many of them to be absorbed into the
British building, agricultural and coalmining industries.
The second large-scale project for the introduction of foreign labour to this
country was the European Volunteer Workers scheme. Workers came to Britain
from the displaced persons camps of the three Western Zones of Germany and
Austria, from Denmark, and finally from the towns and villages of Germany and
Austria. By the end of 1949, 65,000 male volunteers had been placed in work,
mainly in agriculture (35,000) and coalmining (11,000). By that time, those two
industries had reached saturation point as far as foreign workers were concerned
and no more men were recruited. When the recruitment of women ended in April
1951, 33,950 female volunteers had been settled in employment, mainly as domestic
servants (13,300), textile workers (17,200) and nurses (2,200), but difficulties of
absorption were being encountered. The most serious of these difficulties was the
housing shortage, which had the effect of limiting the field from which the aliens
could be selected, since it made it necessary that alien volunteers for work in the
United Kingdom should be without dependants.
Youth Employment Service
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is also responsible for two
specialized employment services: the Youth Employment Service and the Disable¬
ment Resettlement Service.
The purpose of the Youth Employment Service is to help young people leaving
school and young workers under 18 to get a good start in their working life.
The service is under the general direction of the Central Youth Employment
Executive, staffed by officers of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the
Ministry of Education and the Scottish Education Department. This joint executive
is appointed by the Minister of Labour and National Service, who is responsible to
Parliament for the Youth Employment Service as a whole. The Minister has
appointed a National Youth Employment Council and separate Advisory Com¬
mittees for Scotland and for Wales to advise him on questions relating to the
service.
234
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Locally the service is operated in most areas through Youth Employment Offices
established by local education authorities (in Scotland by education authorities)
in accordance with the schemes submitted by them to the Minister of Labour and
National Service and approved by him. In those areas where such schemes are not
in operation, the service is operated by the local office of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate careers informa¬
tion, provide talks in schools, give vocational guidance, help to find suitable employ¬
ment and keep contact with young workers to assist them in settling down. Local
Youth Employment Committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers and
other appropriate interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
Disablement Resettlement Service
The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944, on which all the Ministry’s work
for disabled persons is based, declares its purpose to be ‘to make further and better
provision for enabling persons handicapped by disablement to secure employment
or work on their own account’, and the Disablement Resettlement Service is
designed to help disabled persons to get and keep suitable work. The service is
available to all persons over school-leaving age who are substantially handicapped
as a result of injury, disease or congenital deformity.
The Ministry of Labour and National Service is responsible for the administra¬
tion of the service. At each of its 1,200 local offices a Disablement Resettlement
Officer, working under the direction of the Manager and in co-operation with other
officers, has the special duty of advising and assisting disabled persons in obtaining
suitable employment. This officer is in touch with all the hospitals in his area and
visits any patient who wishes to discuss the question of his future employment. His
work involves close co-operation with doctors, local authorities and voluntary
welfare agencies.
There is also a Disablement Resettlement Officer with similar functions at each
of the three appointments offices.
The help given by the service falls under four main headings:
1. Vocational Guidance. This is given at local offices by Disablement Resettle¬
ment Officers in consultation, as necessary, with the local Disablement Advisory
Committees or Medical Interviewing Committees, and also by vocational psycho¬
logists in the Industrial Rehabilitation Units (see paragraph 3).
2. Placing in Ordinary Competitive Employment. On the basis of a disabled person’s
qualifications and aptitudes and with medical guidance, the Disablement Resettle¬
ment Officer endeavours to find work most suitable for the individual, either
immediately or after a course of industrial rehabilitation or vocational training. To a
limited extent this is facilitated by the main provision of the Disabled Persons
Employment Act, 1944, namely, that all employers of more than 20 persons are
bound by law to employ a quota (at present 3 per cent for almost all industries) of
registered disabled persons. Registration is voluntary. The number of disabled
persons registered was 836,290 at 19th July 1954 and of these 36,823 were con¬
sidered to be capable of ordinary employment but were unemployed. This figure is
estimated as about 4.5 per cent of the total number of registered disabled persons
capable of ordinary competitive employment.
3. Industrial Rehabilitation and Vocational Training. Industrial rehabilitation is
provided at residential and non-residential units run by the Ministry of Labour and
National Service where physical and mental toning-up is given and, for those who
need it, vocational guidance as to the best kind of employment to take up.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT
235
Centres, educational institutions and employers’ establishments (see pp. 231-2). For
the more seriously disabled, however, there are special residential training colleges
run by voluntary organizations with the financial assistance and technical help of
the Ministry of Labour and National Service. There are also arrangements for the
training of special categories of disabled persons such as the blind.
4. Sheltered Employment. Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company,
with no share capital, was established in accordance with the provisions of the
Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944. Its objects are to provide training and
employment facilities for registered disabled persons who are unlikely to obtain
work except under special conditions. Its powers are wide enough to cover the
provision of special factories and workshops, hostel accommodation and facilities
for home workers. The directors are appointed by the Minister of Labour and
National Service; funds for capital development and to meet operational costs are
provided by loans and grants under the Ministry of Labour Vote. At the end of
June 1954 it operated 90 factories employing about 6,500 severely disabled persons.
Facilities for the employment of blind persons are provided by local authorities
directly or through voluntary bodies, with the financial assistance of the Ministry
of Labour and National Service. At the end of June 1954 there were 69 workshops
for the blind in which there were 4,350 blind persons in training or employment.
In addition, where necessary, the Ministry helped to finance the provision of train¬
ing or employment for 911 severely disabled sighted persons in 41 workshops
provided by 32 voluntary undertakings or local authorities.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Today, minimum standards have been established by statute or collective agree¬
ment for both the terms and conditions of employment and the working conditions
of the substantial majority of British workers. The fixing of terms and conditions of
employment, however, involves principles, methods and machinery quite different
from those for the determination of working conditions. Terms and conditions of
employment of the majority of workers are determined by collective agreements
between employers’ associations and trade unions, and the fixing by statute of mini¬
mum wages and terms of employment is confined to those trades or industries where
the organization of employers or workers or both is inadequate to negotiate
collective agreements and ensure their observance.
Minimum standards for working conditions, on the other hand, are laid down by
statute, e.g., the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, and it is the duty of Government
Inspectors to enforce their provisions. The various Acts of Parliament and statutory
regulations made thereunder prescribe minimum standards of safety, health and
welfare for a large proportion of workers, and regulate the hours of work for women
and young persons. In a few exceptional cases additional health, safety or welfare
requirements have been the subject of collective agreement.
Many employers provide working conditions superior to those prescribed by
statute or agreement, and various voluntary bodies advise and assist in improving
these standards.
LABOUR RELATIONS
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organization of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organizations1 discuss and negotiate terms and
1 The few monopolist employers—the central Government and the public corporations
operating the nationalized industries—negotiate with the trade unions representing their
different types of employees.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
236
conditions of employment and other matters affecting the workpeople at their work.
In some cases these negotiations are conducted simply by ad hoc meetings, which
are held when necessary; in other cases voluntary joint machinery has been estab¬
lished on a permanent basis. Normally these arrangements suffice to settle all ques¬
tions which are raised, but provision is often made for matters not so settled to be
referred for settlement to independent arbitration. In certain trades where the
voluntary organization of employers and workers is not adequate for the effective
regulation of the workers’ remuneration, provision has also been made by the State
for statutory regulation under the Wages Councils Acts, 1945 to 1948, the Catering
Wages Act, 1943, the Agricultural Wages Act, 1948, and the Agricultural Wages
(Scotland) Act, 1949.
Employers’ Organizations
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ associations, some
of which have their origins in the nineteenth century. They are generally organized
on an ‘industry basis’—some being purely local in character and dealing with a
section of an industry only, while others have a national scope and concern them¬
selves with the whole of an industry. In some cases the local associations are
organized into district or national federations.
The central organ of employers’ associations is the British Employers’ Confedera¬
tion, to which the majority of employers’ associations and federations in the
principal industries are affiliated. It deals with matters affecting the interests of
organized employers in their relations with their workpeople, and is recognized
by the Government as the principal channel of consultation between Government
Departments and representatives of organized employers as a whole on all such
matters.
The Confederation acts as an advisory and consultative body for its member
organizations, providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining and
acting upon their collective views and representing these nationally to the
Government and to the public, and also internationally, for example, to the
International Labour Organization.
While the main function of employers’ organizations consists in the safeguarding
of the interests of their members, a number consider that this purpose can be
furthered by the provision of advice and assistance to member firms and by such
special services as the organization of general training courses and special courses
on subjects such as work study and its application. Where employers’ organiza¬
tions do not themselves provide such services they make arrangements for putting
their members in touch with the appropriate specialist agency.
Trade Unions
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organized into trade unions. These have grown up gradually
and independently over a great many years, and consequently their form and
organization vary considerably. Trade unions started more than two hundred years
ago among the skilled craftsmen and spread later to the general labouring and
unskilled classes. More recently trade unionism has increased among clerical,
supervisory, technical and administrative workers.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational, e.g., they may
recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed, while in others the qualification is
industrial, i.e. they seek to recruit all persons in an industry, whatever their
occupation. In a number of unions recruitment is based on a combination of these
principles.
LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT
237
At the end of 1952 the total membership of British trade unions was 9,524,000.
There were 690 separate trade unions, but 67 per cent of all trade unionists were
in 17 big unions.
The basic unit of organization in most British trade unions is the local branch or
lodge. Every member of the union belongs to a branch or lodge. He may attend its
meetings, put forward suggestions about terms and conditions of employment,
discuss the work and policy of the union, and take part in the election of branch
officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered purely or mainly of
local interest but refers wider issues to the union’s national or regional bodies.
Many unions also have shop stewards or other representatives at the place of
work to enrol members and collect dues, to report any encroachment on agreed
or customary conditions of work and in some cases to act as representatives of
members at their place of work for the settlement of grievances.
In most large unions the central organization is along the following lines:
Elected officials, including a General Secretary assisted by clerical and specialist
staff, are in charge of the work of head office and are responsible to a National
Executive Council or Committee which may be part or full time, and which is
usually elected by, and responsible to, annual or biennial conferences of delegates
from the branches.
Executive committees play an important part in the government of the unions;
between conferences they are the highest authorities and carry out policy decisions
made by delegates.
Most unions also have some kind of regional, district or area organizations, while
in large unions there is usually also a system of regional, district or area committees
and councils.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations whose
main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade unions in an
industry in negotiation with employers. The scope and authority of these federa¬
tions and confederations vary greatly in different circumstances.
All the trade unions of any size or importance except the National Union of
Teachers, the National Association of Local Government Officers and certain
civil service staff associations are affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the
national centre of the British trade union movement. The objects of the TUC are
to promote the interests of all its affiliated organizations and generally to improve
the economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises 183
organizations, a number of which are federations so that in total 330 unions are
affiliated. These represent over 8 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all
general questions which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally
and gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or industries at the
request of the trade union concerned. The congress of delegates, which constitutes
the TUC proper, meets for a week every year to discuss matters of general interest
to trade unionists and to employees generally. The General Council, elected
annually, represents the TUC between congresses. A large part of its work consists
of acting as a spokesman for British trade unionists on matters affecting their
general interests, of co-ordinating trade union activities and determining dis¬
agreements between trade unions, of providing a number of educational and
other common services and of preparing a report and agenda for the annual
congress.
Both the TUC and a number of affiliated trade unions have in recent years paid
increasing attention to the education of their members not only in general economic
questions and trade union practice but also in production subjects including work
study and costing, which have not hitherto been regarded as coming within their
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
238
field. The TUC itself holds regular one-week courses on production and manage¬
ment subjects and on industrial relations, as well as a two-weeks course on trade
union subjects. It also organizes week-end schools and summer schools. These are
open to members of any affiliated union, usually by nomination from the union.
A number of the larger unions hold similar courses. In addition, arrangements are
made for union officials to attend courses on production questions at technical
colleges. Some unions also make use of industrial consultants for this purpose.
The Trades Union Congress is recognized by the Government as the principal
channel of consultation between the Government Departments and representatives
of organized workers on matters affecting the interests of employees generally.
There is also a separate Scottish Trades Union Congress, to which trade unions
may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality often voluntarily affiliate to a local
trades council. This acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common interest
and as local agent of the Trades Union Congress, by which it is annually registered.
There are about 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped together
in 23 federations.
Voluntary Joint Negotiating Machinery
At National Level. While in some industries all matters affecting terms and
conditions of employment are discussed on an ad hoc basis between the employers
organizations and the trade unions concerned, in other industries there are standard
procedures for dealing with such matters by joint discussion at a national level. In
many industries there are, for this purpose, bodies composed of representatives of
both sides of the industry with, in some cases, an independent chairman. Some are
known as Joint Industrial Councils, of which there are about 130, while the corre¬
sponding bodies in central and local Government service are known as Whitley
Councils1 (see pp. 58 and 64). The functions of all these bodies vary considerably,
some being merely wage-negotiating bodies, while others deal with a wide range of
subjects affecting the interests of the industry concerned. Provision is sometimes
made in the constitution of such bodies that, where it is not found possible to reach
agreed terms of settlement in a particular dispute, the matter should be referred
to some form of conciliation or arbitration by independent persons, including
the methods provided under the Conciliation Act, 1896, or the Industrial Courts
Act, 1919 (see p. 239).
At District and Factory Level. Similar arrangements exist at district and factory
level in many industries, where matters are discussed either between the appropriate
representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis, or through regular machinery
provided by District Joint Industrial Councils or similar bodies and Works Councils
(see p. 240). Such bodies discuss how agreements reached at a national level may
be applied to their district or factory, but as a rule have no power to alter the terms
of such national agreements. They also discuss new problems which may arise, and if
no solution can be found at factory or district level the matter may be referred to
the national body.
Statutory Wage-Regulating Machinery
In certain industries in which, owing to the lack of organization among employers
and workers, voluntary negotiating arrangements do not exist for the effective
settlement of terms and conditions of employment or are inadequate to secure their
observance by voluntary methods throughout the industry, statutory bodies known
1 Named after Mr. J. H. Whitley, former Speaker of the House of Commons and
chairman of a committee which investigated industrial unrest from 1916 to 1919.
LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT
239
as Wages Councils, Catering Wages Boards and Agricultural Wages Boards have
been set up. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers
and workers in the respective industries, with the addition of certain independent
members. Wages Councils and Catering Wages Boards are empowered to submit
proposals for the fixing of minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the
Minister of Labour and National Service, who is then required by the Acts con¬
cerned to make Orders giving statutory force to such proposals, subject only to his
right to return them to the Board or Council for further consideration.
Orders relative to employment in agriculture are made by the appropriate
Agricultural Wages Board (England and Wales or Scotland) and are effective only
in the County Agricultural Wages Committee area in respect of which such Orders
have been made.
State Provision for Conciliation, Arbitration and Investigation
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred
by agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators. Under authority derived
from the Conciliation Act, 1896, and the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, the Minister
of Labour and National Service has certain powers to assist industry to settle
disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry’s own
machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement and not
to supersede the industry’s own machinery.
To assist conciliation in industry a staff of conciliation officers forms part of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service. The duties of these officers are to keep
in touch with the course of relations between employers and workers at national,
district, and, in some cases, factory level, and to assist them, if requested, to settle
their problems by joint discussion and negotiation.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both parties,
be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or an ad hoc
Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent tribunal established
under the Industrial Courts Act. The Court is normally constituted of three
members—the President, one member representing employers and one represent¬
ing workpeople. At present, provision is also made by an order under emergency
legislation for disputes and ‘issues’1 about terms and conditions of employment, to
be reported to the Minister in certain circumstances by one of the parties, and to
be referred, if all other means of settlement have been exhausted, to an Industrial
Disputes Tribunal, whose award can be legally enforced. This tribunal consists of a
chairman and two other independent members appointed by the Minister of
Labour and National Service together with one member representing employers
and one representing workpeople. These representatives are drawn from panels
appointed by the Minister after consultation with the British Employers’ Confedera¬
tion and the Trades Union Congress respectively.
The Minister is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry or Committee of
Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended. These are primarily
means of informing public opinion of the facts of a dispute and not means of
arbitration. The report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before Parliament.
Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies are not
binding on the parties, they usually provide the basis of a settlement of the
difference.
1 A dispute concerns the terms of employment or conditions of labour of workmen. An
issue concerns the observance by an employer of the terms of an agreement or other
‘recognized terms and conditions’ in his trade or industry.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
240
The machinery for negotiation and conciliation of disputes has reduced the need
for direct industrial action, i.e. strikes and lock-outs. Time lost by stoppages of work
caused by industrial disputes has been substantially less in the last twenty years
than formerly. The average time lost in the five years 1949-53 was I'^ million
man days or less than a twelfth of a day per worker per year. The reduction has been
in the size and duration of strikes and not in their number. Small local strikes
without the backing of a trade union headquarters have been relatively frequent.
Liaison between the Government and Industry
As will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs, the Government is in contact
with representatives of employers and workers at all levels on matters affecting
their common interests. At local and district level the conciliation officers of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service keep in touch with the representatives of
both sides of industry, while at national level officers of the Department attend the
meetings of many Joint Industrial Councils as liaison officers. Standing arrange¬
ments also exist for consultation between the Government and the British
Employers’ Confederation and Trades Union Congress through the National
Joint Advisory Council, which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government on
matters in which employers and workers have a common interest. It meets quarterly
under the chairmanship of the IVIinister of Labour and National Service. Its
membership consists of representatives of the British Employers Confederation
and the Trades Union Congress, together with representatives of the managements
of nationalized industries. Among the subjects which it has considered in recent
years are the machinery for settling industrial disputes, joint consultation in
industry, industrial training and recruitment, double day shiftworking, and the
economic situation with special reference to production, wages and prices.
Joint Consultation in Industry at Factory Level
In addition to the arrangements already described, the purpose of which is
mainly but not exclusively for discussion and settlement of terms and conditions of
employment, there are, in many industries, national agreements which recommend
the establishment, in firms of sufficient size, of machinery for joint consultation
between management and workers on problems of common interest. In some
industries the constitution and functions of Works Councils are laid down in the
agreement, while in others model constitutions are made available. In other
industries where no national agreement on the subject has been reached the practice
of joint consultation in the factory is becoming increasingly widespread.
The range of subjects which Works Councils can fruitfully discuss is wide and
includes hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety, efficiency of
production, absenteeism, labour turnover, training, education, recreation and
employees’ services generally. The constitution and functions of these committees
vary widely from one firm to another. It is the general practice, however, to exclude
from their scope all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and
other matters covered by negotiation between organizations of employers and
workers. It is the policy of the Government to foster the development of voluntary
joint consultation throughout industry, not only because of its effect on production
but also as a most important means of maintaining good relationships between
management and employees.
At individual factory level, Personnel Management Advisers of the Ministry of
Labour and National Service are often approached by firms seeking advice on the
establishment of Works Councils or on ways in which their activities can be made
more effective.

WORKING CONDITIONS : THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND
Protective legislation in mines and quarries, factories, building and civil engineer¬
ing, docks, wharves, and industrial workplaces generally is detailed and comprehen¬
sive and its enforcement strict, and a certain amount of protective legislation also
exists in respect of non-industrial occupations.
The Government has accepted in principle recommendations made in 1949 by a
committee under the chairmanship of Sir Ernest Gowers for extending to non¬
industrial occupations safety, health and welfare requirements similar to those for
factories; and has started consultations with the various interested organizations
with a view to introducing the necessary legislation at a later date.
Local authorities have power to regulate the provision of suitable sanitary con¬
veniences in houses and at places of work and to treat workplaces which are dirty or
dangerously ill-ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances whose abatement can be
enforced. They have also wide powers to regulate hours and conditions of employ¬
ment of children in their areas within the limits laid down by national legislation.
The general effect of the national legislation is to forbid the employment of children
under 13 years of age, to forbid the employment of children between the ages of 13
and 15 during school hours on school days, or between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. on any
day, or for more than two hours on school days or Sundays. The employment of
children in any industrial undertaking before they reach the age of 15 is prohibited.
The Shops Act, 1950, consolidating earlier Shops Acts, empowers local authorities
to ensure that all shops in their area have proper ventilation, temperature, lighting,
sanitary and washing facilities, and that they observe the requirements of the Act
with regard to closing hours, meal intervals and holidays.
Certain industrial premises (factories, shipyards, docks, etc.) come under the
Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, which are administered by the Ministry of Labour
and National Service and enforced by Her Majesty’s Factory Inspectorate, which is
part of the Ministry.
The Acts lay down general requirements with regard to safety, such as the fencing
and proper maintenance of machinery, lifting appliances and steam boilers and
other pressure vessels; sound construction and proper maintenance of floors,
passages and stairs, safe means of access to workplaces and means of escape in case
of fire; and the prevention of escape of dangerous fumes and dust into the work¬
room. They also lay down general requirements with regard to health and welfare,
e.g., with regard to cleanliness, the provision of sanitary accommodation, cubic
space per worker, temperature, ventilation, lighting, washing facilities, accommo¬
dation for outdoor clothing, drinking water, first aid and provision of seats.
Any person intending to use premises as a factory has to notify the Inspector of
Factories of his intention not less than one month before he begins to occupy them.
All young persons under 18 years of age must be medically examined by doctors
appointed by the Chief Inspector of Factories on entry to employment in factories,
docks, or on building operations, and must be re-examined annually. The hours
permissible to be worked by women and young persons between the ages of 16 and
18 are limited to 48 in a week and 9 in a day, although some overtime is allowed
(up to six hours a week for not more than 100 hours a year nor in more than 25
weeks in a year). Young persons under 16 years of age are limited to 44 hours a
week. Adequate intervals for meals must be arranged for women and young persons
and the employment of women and girls by night is, in general, prohibited.
These general requirements for safety, health and welfare are supplemented or
modified by regulations providing safeguards against special risks or conditions in
particular industries, processes, establishments or machines.
242
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
For mines and quarries, provision is made for dealing with such matters as
ventilation, dust suppression, rescue work, first aid and the initial medical examina¬
tion of certain new entrants by official doctors. There are many detailed require¬
ments for the safe conduct of operations, and restrictions on the employment
of women and young persons, including the prohibition of the employment of
women below ground in mines, which has been forbidden since 1842. These
requirements are incorporated in the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954 (which con¬
solidated and extended the provisions of previous legislation) and in Regulations
and Orders, etc., made thereunder. The Ministry of Fuel and Power is generally
responsible for the administration of these enactments, while the Mines and
Quarries Inspectorate, which is part of that Ministry, is directly responsible for
their enforcement.
In agriculture, special attention has been paid to the protection of workers against
risks of poisoning, due to the use of toxic chemicals, and recent legislation—the
Agricultural (Poisonous Substances) Act, 1952 imposes necessary safeguards.
The Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1938, extended the restrictions on the
hours of work of young persons to certain occupations not covered by the Factories
Acts or Shops Acts. The proportion of young workers whose hours were subject to
statutory limitation was estimated in 1947 to be about 65 per cent.
WORKING CONDITIONS IN PRACTICE
Earnings
Standard minimum time rates for British manual workers vary mainly between
2s. yd. and 3s. yd. an hour for men, and between is. gd. and 2s. 6d. for women.
These basic time rates are not, however, an accurate guide to average earnings.
LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT
243
Higher time rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates, shift rates and overtime rates
raise the level of average earnings. The Ministry of Labour and National Service
conducts a six-monthly survey of earnings and hours of work in some of the
principal British industries. The survey for April 1954 covered about 6| million
workers and showed the average hourly earnings in all the industries covered to be
as follows:
Men 21 years and over . . . . . . . . . # 4S i-jj
Youths and boys under 21 years . . . . .. is. iod.
Women 18 years and over . . . . . . . , 2s. 4-ld.
Girls under 18 years . . . . . . . . . . Is 6-5(1
All workers . . . . . . . . . . 3S yj
Average weekly earnings were:
Men  197s. 8d.
Youths    Od.
Women  105s. 3d.
GirIs  65s. lOd.
All workers  166s. 6d.
The principal industries not covered by this survey were agriculture, where the
average weekly earnings for regular adult male workers were 142s. 6d. in the year
April 1953 to March 1954; coalmining, where, according to information collected
by the National Coal Board, the average weekly cash earnings for men were
257s- 2d. plus 12s. id. in kind, in May 1954; railway services, in which average
weekly earnings in March 1954 of men in the wages grades were 188s. 2d. and
those of women were 115s. yd-; and dock labour, in which average weekly earn¬
ings of dock workers employed by the National Dock Labour Board for April to
June 1954 were 2iys. 6d.
Hours of Work
While, as already stated, the hours of work in factories of women and young
persons between the ages of 16 and 18 are limited by law to 48 a week and those of
young persons under 16 to 44 a week, normal hours of work for all ages and sexes
are usually shorter. Agreed weekly hours mainly vary between 42 and 46, averaging
between 44 and 45, and may be worked as either a five- or a five-and-a-half-day
week according to the industry and the rule of the particular establishment. Hours
actually worked are somewhat longer owing to overtime working. The survey con¬
ducted by the Ministry of Labour and National Service in April 1954 into earnings
and hours showed that average weekly hours actually worked were as follows:
Men
Youths and boys
Women . .
Girls
All workers
48-3 hours
44-7 „
420 „
42-7 „
46-5 „
Holidays with Pay
In addition to six statutory public holidays nearly all employees have at least one
week’s holiday with pay each year, and the majority have at least two weeks. The
statutory holidays are as follows: in addition to Good Friday and Christmas Day,
there are Bank Holidays in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel
Islands on Easter Monday, Whit-Monday, the first Monday in August and the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
first weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day), and in Scotland on New Year s Day,
the first Monday in May, and the first Monday in August.
Safety
Safety depends in practice at least as much on the education of the worker as
upon safety regulations. The Accident Prevention Movement, a voluntary educa¬
tional campaign, is strongly supported by the Factory Inspectorate and the Mines
and Quarries Inspectorate. Inspectors inquire into safety problems, and advise
makers on safety aspects of machine design and specification, circulate expert
advice by personal exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourage the appoint¬
ment of Safety Officers and the formation of Accident Prevention Committees.
A Safety, Health and Welfare Museum in London is maintained by the Ministry
of Labour and National Service.
In road, rail and air transport most of the work is outside the jurisdiction of the
Factory Inspectorate, but elaborate safety codes are laid down by the various
transport authorities. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents helps the
Accident Prevention Movement by providing posters and pamphlets and by
organizing training courses for safety officers.
Fatal industrial accidents have tended to diminish during the twentieth century
in spite of the increase in the number of persons employed. Such accidents rose
somewhat in factories during the early years of the second world war. Since then,
however, there has been a further decline. Fatal industrial accidents in 1953
numbered 1,630; of these 446 were in mines and quarries, 744 in establishments
under the Factories Acts, 203 in railway service, 221 on ships registered in the
United Kingdom and 16 in commercial aviation.
Health and Welfare
Many employers achieve health and welfare standards higher than those pre¬
scribed by law. An increasing number of firms in Britain provide a whole-time or
part-time doctor, an industrial nurse, and a canteen with hot meals, and operate
retirement and sickness insurance schemes supplementing National Insurance
benefits. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
Health and welfare standards vary from one factory to another. Between a third
and a half of the factory workers of the country are employed by small firms
employing less than 250 workers, and many of these find it hard to spare the
management time and the funds needed to improve employee services. ,
The amenities provided by large factories depend partly on the employees’ needs
and desires. The requirements of a factory, where the work is safe and easy and
many employees are women or young persons, are different from those of engineer¬
ing or steel works, where work is arduous, dirty and dangerous and undertaken
mainly by men.
Progressive firms are careful to find out what their employees want, and welfare
policy is often decided in consultation with the workers, whether through regular
consultative machinery or by other means.
In the coalmining industry, the National Coal Board has continued to strengthen
the medical services which existed before nationalization. Chief Divisional and
Area Medical Officers have been appointed, and doctors have been appointed to the
larger collieries and to groups of collieries. Medical centres with proper accommoda¬
tion and the services of doctors and registered nurses are being set up at the pithead.
A number of official and voluntary bodies help to supply the research, advice and
assistance necessary for developing higher standards of industrial health and
welfare. These bodies include, besides the Factory and the Mines and Quarries
LABOUR AND MANAGEMENT
245
Inspectorates, such Government agencies as the Medical Research Council (see
PP‘ 345 6)> the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, including the
National Physical Laboratory (see pp. 344—5), and the Government Chemist; the
Departments of Industrial Health and Social Medicine of the Universities; such
voluntary bodies as the Central Council for Health Education, and the Industrial
Welfare Society, and the research and personnel departments of various large
industrial concerns. Co-ordination is provided by a number of general and special
committees.
Human Relations in Industry
There has been a considerable growth in recent years of interest in ‘human
relations in industry, i.e. relations between management and their workers as
individuals, as distinct from relations between organizations of employers and
organizations of workers. This has led to more widespread attention being given
to all aspects of personnel management and to the establishment of more personnel
departments. Between 1939 snd 1944 the number of whole-time personnel
managers and welfare officers increased from about 1,500 to 6,000, and this increase
seems to have continued since, though perhaps more slowly. While the form of
organization of personnel departments varies, the personnel officer is generally
responsible for advising all levels of management on the development of good
industrial relations. This officer also has particular duties with regard to recruit¬
ment, selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the application of wage
agreements, the promotion of joint consultation and the supervision of working
conditions and employee services.
Both voluntary and official organizations have been concerned with the promo¬
tion of better human relationships in industry.
The voluntary organizations include bodies which deal with management
problems and provide a service to subscribing firms, professional associations
linking individuals who have a common interest in particular functions of manage¬
ment and administration, and bodies which provide specialist services usually on
a fee-paying basis.
In x945 the Ministry of Labour and National Service established a Personnel
Management Advisory Service which has done much to promote good personnel
management and to assist firms by discussing problems of personnel policy. The
service is staffed by a team of experienced Personnel Management Advisers
recruited from industry.
In March 1953 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the
Medical Research Council set up two committees which are concerned with
research into the human factor in industry. They are known respectively as the
Committee on Human Relations in Industry and the Committee on Individual
Efficiency in Industry.
The Committee on Human Relations has approved a number of projects for
research into factors influencing the effectiveness of incentive payment schemes,
factors facilitating and restricting the introduction of new techniques and methods
m industry, characteristics of management organization affecting productivity,
industrial education, training and promotion, and the problems of the effective
employment in industry of special groups such as older persons and married
women.
The Committee on Individual Efficiency has concerned itself with research into
such matters as the influence of equipment and tool design on operator efficiency,
factors affecting the efficient utilization of industrial engineering techniques, and
training methods in industry.
VIII. FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities finance their activities
—how their expenditure is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Moneys administered by public authorities can be roughly divided into two
categories:
x. Exchequer: the moneys of the central Government, raised and disbursed in
accordance with the proposals of the Government, as approved by Parlia¬
ment (principally the House of Commons). There are also funds adminis¬
tered for special purposes by Government Departments and wholly or
partially maintained by receipts which do not come from the Exchequer.
The only important one at present is the National Insurance Fund, adminis¬
tered by the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, used for the pay¬
ment of benefits under the National Insurance Scheme (see pp. 295-6) and
for a small part of the cost of the National Health Service (see p. 303).
2. Local Government: the moneys of local authorities, obtained partly from
rates (local taxes on dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from
property, and partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer. Local
authorities may also raise loans in the open market.
The following broad account of Government finance will be concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government1 and other public
funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the principle
that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was gradually evolved.
The principle was established, at the end of the constitutional struggles of the
Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights, 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once the King
was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free to spend it as he
chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House of Commons gradually
developed the modern system of controlling expenditure through the device of
Appropriation, which was embodied in its final form in the Exchequer and Audit
Departments Act, 1866.
Since the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such financial
control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of Commons.
This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seventeenth century, but
as regards expenditure it was not effective until the nineteenth century. The con¬
trolling power of the House of Commons is acknowledged today in the Speech from
the Throne at the opening of a new session of Parliament, which is addressed
to both Houses but contains a special paragraph addressed to the Commons
alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power to
modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions. It was
indeed to minimize the chance of rejection that the practice was started in 1861 of
embodying the main financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill. Since

FINANCE
247
the passing of the Parliament Act, 1911, however, the assent of the House of Lords
is no longer necessary for a Bill certified by the Speaker to be a Money Bill (see
p. 29).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all
expenditure by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue by
taxation or borrowing. All Government revenue is paid into the Government
account with the Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the
Consolidated Fund. With certain exceptions (the main one being National Insur¬
ance benefits), all payments by the Government come out of this account.
The following section outlines the machinery by which expenditure and revenue
are authorized and controlled, the purposes on which public money is spent and
the sources from which revenue is obtained.
ESTIMATES AND EXPENDITURE
Classification of Expenditure
Central Government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorized by Act of Parliament without
limitation to any particular year. This expenditure includes the interest,
sinking fund and cost of management of the National Debt, the income of
members of the Royal Family, and salaries and pensions of judges and cer¬
tain high officers whose independence of the Government is thought to be
better guaranteed by permanent grant than by annual vote. These Consoli¬
dated Fund Services represent a permanent charge on the Consolidated
fund.
2. All other Government expenditure, which is authorized from year to year
and which includes all expenditure on defence, on the social services and on
the general administration of the country. These are called Supply Services
because the House of Commons, when voting money, is granting to the
Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy . . . the pecuniary
necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that some of this
expenditure may also depend on legislation, such as the National Health
Service Acts, relating to a specific object of expenditure.
Authorizing Expenditure
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of
Commons in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House with
the Chairman of Committees, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair). The Committee
usually discusses public policy relevant to the Estimates, though any Estimate could
be examined in detail if members wished and if time allowed (see also p. 32).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April are
submitted to the Treasury by each Department in the preceding November and
December. Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’
which are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed in the
Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the moneys to specific Votes. Inside each
Vote, the spending of money on one subhead instead of on another, or ‘virement,
is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but only with Treasury consent.
Departments are free to distribute expenditure within subheads as they please
subject to Treasury approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An excess of expenditure, or new services not covered by the Vote, or virement
R
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
248
of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should be brought to
the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate. The Treasury
exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the ordinary Estimates.
Scrutiny of Expenditure
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, by the Select Committee on Public Accounts of the House of
Commons and by the Select Committee on Estimates.
The Treasury
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure is part of the responsibility of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the House
of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by Departments, the
Treasury has to weigh the advantages of administrative proposals against the
monetary and economic cost, taking into account current Government policy,
to decide the relative merits of expenditure proposed by different Departments
and to eliminate any overlapping, uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where
this has escaped the net of departmental financial control. Quite apart from the
scrutiny of Estimates, throughout the year the Treasury keeps a close gontrol
over such matters as rates of pay and the aggregate size of the staff in all Govern¬
ment Departments in addition to exercising a general supervision over all depart¬
mental expenditure. The Treasury also lays down general rules of financial and
accounting procedure for Departments and prescribes the principles on which
departmental contracts shall be made and the limits within which losses may be
written off.
The Comptroller and Auditor General
Control over issues of money to Departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent appoint¬
ment as an officer of Parliament. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comp¬
troller of the Exchequer he controls entries and issues of public money to and from
the Exchequer Account, and as Auditor he audits departmental accounts and sub¬
mits the Appropriation Accounts to Parliament. His statutory function is to ensure
that all expenditure is properly incurred, e.g., that no payments are made which go
beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has been
obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged by
successive Committees on Public Accounts (see next paragraph) to examine depart¬
mental expenditure with a view to drawing the attention of that Committee to any
cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The Select Committee on Public Accounts
The accounts of each Department and the reports of the Comptroller and
Auditor General thereon are considered by the Select Committee on Public
Accounts—the ‘PAC’. This was set up in 1861, by Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose
of ensuring that expenditure was properly incurred in accordance with the Esti¬
mates and with any relevant Acts of Parliament, but it has since developed much
wider powers. Nowadays it may consider whether full value has been obtained for
the sums spent by Departments and it examines cases in which the administration
appears to have been faulty or negligent. The Committee has therefore become a
powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and inefficiency. It embodies its
findings in Reports which may be discussed in the House of Commons. Its recom¬
mendations are considered by the Treasury in consultation with Departments and
FINANCE
249
put into effect, so far as they are accepted, according to Treasury instructions. If
the recommendations are not acceptable a reasoned reply has to be submitted to the
Committee, which may either accept the objections or return to the charge in
subsequent reports.
Select Committee on Estimates
This Committee was originally set up in 1912 but was re-formed in 1929 with
wider terms of reference. Under these terms it has been re-appointed annually
except during the war years. The Committee’s functions are to examine the
Estimates, to suggest the form in which they should be presented, and to report
whether there are any economies which could be made without altering the policy
implied in the Estimates. In practice the Estimates for the current year are not
affected, but the Committee’s recommendations may reinforce Treasury control
and influence the nature of expenditure in succeeding years.
REVENUE AND THE BUDGET
Sources of Revenue
Money to meet the needs of the central Government is in normal years derived
mainly from taxation. The revenue from loans and investments is small, and other
sources of revenue, e.g., trading surpluses of Government Departments, are not
important.
Taxes can be divided into two groups, direct and indirect, which correspond
roughly to the duties collected by the Board of Inland Revenue and by the Customs
and Excise Department. The most important Inland Revenue duties—income tax
(including surtax), profits tax and estate duties (death duties)—are levied directly on
the income or property of those who, in general, have to bear them. Income tax on
individual (though not on corporate) incomes and death duties are progressive
taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates bear a proportionately higher rate of tax.
Stamp duties, although not a direct tax, are also collected by the Board of Inland
Revenue. Taxes on motor vehicles are collected by local taxation authorities,
which are the County or County Borough Councils in England and Wales and
the corresponding Councils in Scotland; the proceeds are paid direct to the
Exchequer.
Most indirect or outlay taxes are Customs and Excise duties and are levied on
commodities or services. They are called indirect because the importer, manufac¬
turer or wholesaler pays them first and then passes them on to the individual con¬
sumer in the form of higher retail prices.
Customs duties are levied on imported goods, and Excise duties on goods pro¬
duced, and services provided, at home. The Purchase Tax is, for all practical
purposes, an Excise duty, although it is also levied on the appropriate imported
goods.
Budget Procedure
‘Budget’ is an ancient name for a bag containing papers or accounts. The origin
of the term lies in the phrase ‘The Chancellor of the Exchequer opened his budget ,
which was applied in Parliament to the annual speech of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer explaining his proposals for making revenue and expenditure balance.
By the time the Budget is introduced, the Estimates will have been presented to
Parliament and published, and the expected total of Government expenditure for
the year will be known.
250
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Budget speech is the main occasion of the year for reviewing the financial
state of the nation. But its formal basis is the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s pro¬
posals for raising money by taxation: he estimates the yield of the revenue on the
basis of existing taxation and proposes such changes as will provide whatever
surplus or deficit he considers desirable on general economic grounds. These
proposals are embodied in Budget resolutions which are subsequently examined by
the House of Commons’ Committee of Ways and Means, and later embodied in
detail in a Finance Bill.
Budget Policy
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money for
Government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated that
taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the level of the
expenditure on particular goods and services. Later on it was gradually realized that
taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore the general level
of economic activity. Since the war, Budgets have been consciously designed in
greater or lesser degree to bring the total of personal and governmental demand for
goods and services into balance with the supplies which could be made available.
Direct taxation on income and property affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of income and property, the proportion of a
high income going in tax being much greater than the proportion of a small one;
at the same time, the services provided by the Government (whether in cash or
kind) are generally available to all irrespective of wealth, but in some cases they are
specially designed to benefit people with lower incomes. Indirect taxes do not affect
the distribution of income; their main purpose has always been the raising of
revenue, but by discouraging or encouraging consumption of particular goods they
can be used to influence the allocation of resources and the pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure (personal and governmental),
and therefore the total demand for goods and services, in the following way: if
there is an increase in Government expenditure without an increase in taxation
then total demand for goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will
happen if there is a decrease in taxation without a decrease in Government spend¬
ing. In this way the Budget can be used to counter unemployment. On the other
hand if there is an increase in taxation without an increase in Government expendi¬
ture or a decrease in Government expenditure without a decrease in taxation then
the total demand for goods and services will tend to fall. In this way the Budget can
be used to counter inflation.
For some years after the war, budgetary policy was mainly designed to avoid
inflation by holding down consumer demand for goods and services so that it would
not hamper exports, investment or (since 1950) the defence programme. The
Budgets of 1951 and 1952 aimed also to hold down investment in the interests of
exports and defence. By 1953, however, as total demand had fallen while productive
capacity had increased, some unused resources became available; in consequence
there was a reduction of taxation in the 1953 Budget, which aimed particularly at
encouraging higher investment and production. These aims were continued in
the 1954 Budget, when, however, changes in taxation were much smaller than in
1953-
The principal taxation changes in the Budget of 1954 were as follows:
Income Tax and Profits Tax, introduction of investment allowance instead of
initial allowance; Estate Duty (Death Duty), increase from £2,000 to £10,000 in
limit for non-aggregation of free and settled estate, and relief of 45 per cent of
duty payable in respect of certain fixed assets; Customs and Excise, reduction in
FINANCE
251
entertainment duty. The net effect of these changes will be to reduce revenue
by £4 million in 1954-55 and £6 million in a full year. (These figures exclude the
cost of the investment allowance, which is put at £4 million in 1955-56 and which
will increase thereafter.)
THE EXCHEQUER ACCOUNTS
In the Budget of April 1954, total current expenditure for the financial year
ending 31st March 1955 was estimated to reach £4,523 million, while the estimate
for total current revenue (after allowing for taxation changes) was £4,533 million,
making a surplus of £10 million. These figures exclude self-balancing revenue and
expenditure (almost entirely post office trading), for which the estimate was £240
million. On capital account, total expenditure was estimated at £598 million, while
total receipts were estimated at £191 million leaving a deficit, to be met by borrowing,
of £407 million. Comparable figures for previous years are given in Table 6, p. 92.
Budget and Expenditure
Total ‘ordinary’ expenditure for 1954-55 fall8 under four main heads: defence
preparations £1,668 million (37 per cent of the total), National Debt service £606
million (i3‘5 per cent), social services and subsidies £1,737 million (38 per cent)
and general services, which make up the remaining £511 million (11-5 per cent).
The total for defence preparations, £1,668 million, is made up of £1,640 million
voted for Service Departments for the defence programme less American Aid
receipts (expected to amount to £85-4 million), plus £113-5 million for defence
preparations under civil votes, mainly civil defence and strategic reserves.
The second heading, National Debt service, comprises £570 million for interest
and management charges on War Loans, Savings Certificates and other forms of
national debt, and £36 million for sinking funds.
The main items under the third heading, social services and subsidies (£i,737
million) can be subdivided as follows: education (£307 million); health services
(£430 million); Government contributions to National Insurance Fund, family
allowances, war pensions, etc. (£391 million); assistance to local authorities for
housing, police, roads, etc. (£272 million); and agricultural and food subsidies
(£337 million).
The main items under the fourth heading, general services (£511 million) are:
Commonwealth and foreign services £90 million; works, buildings, stationery and
information services £62 million; Irish Services1 £59 million; supply and trading
services £57 million; tax collection £47 million; agriculture and fisheries £37
million; broadcasting £19 million; research and development £19 million2;
employment services £19 million; civil aviation £17 million; and Colonial develop¬
ment and welfare £17 million.
Current Revenue
The total current revenue estimated for i954“55 (£4»533 million) falls under two
main heads: Inland Revenue, £2,384 million (53 per cent of the total) and Customs
and Excise, £1,782 million (39 per cent). The remaining 8 per cent consists of
1 Mainly the payment made to Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom Exchequer
under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 (see footnote 2, p. 23), in compensation for
the tax revenue which is remitted to the Exchequer by Northern Ireland; together with
certain services administered in Northern Ireland by United Kingdom Government
Departments.

Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April. For 1954-55 the standard rate is 9s. in the £. The tax imposed on an
individual is graduated by means of personal allowances, by reduced rates of tax
on the first sections of taxable income, and by the surtax. In the case of a married
couple the incomes of husband and wife are aggregated and are treated as one
income, but a higher personal allowance is given than for a single person. Companies
are liable at the standard rate on their total income, irrespective of the amount of
that income. Companies are also subject to Profits Tax.

254
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The amount of income tax paid yearly by people with different incomes is shown
in Table 36. Since 1943 most wage and salary earners have paid their income tax
under a PAYE (‘Pay-as-you-earn’) Scheme which enables them to keep up to date
in their tax payments week by week (or month by month if they are paid monthly).
In general, the income of a visitor to the United Kingdom arising from sources
within the United Kingdom is subject to United Kingdom income tax, except in
the case of certain United Kingdom Government securities. Where the income
arises from sources outside the United Kingdom tax is not chargeable unless the
visitor becomes chargeable as a resident. The United Kingdom has entered into
agreements with many countries providing for relief from double taxation; where
such agreements are not in force the United Kingdom allows unilateral relief.1
The scale of death duties is illustrated in Table 37. In 1946 estates of a net
capital value of less than £2,000 were exempted from payment of death duty and a
new scale for values over £2,000 was introduced. The scale was altered again in
1949, when legacy and succession duties were consolidated with death duties.

255
Capital Payments and Receipts
The Government also receives funds and makes payments of a capital nature for
which it has statutory power to borrow and which are therefore excluded from the
Budget expenditure met from revenue. In the last few years the main items of
capital expenditure have been loans to local authorities for housing and other invest¬
ment (for which purposes about £400 million is budgeted in 1954-55); loans for
the development of new towns; and working capital for the National Coal Board.
Capital receipts have come mainly from the repayment of these loans. If, on balance,
there is a deficit, it is met from the proceeds of Government borrowing, while if
there is a surplus it goes to reduce the National Debt.
The National Debt
So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from £651 million in
1914 to £7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million in
1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On the 31st March 1954 the total National Debt
was £26,583 million, of which £2,115 million was held externally, mainly by the
United States and Canadian Governments. Of the £24,468 million of internal debt,
about £4,819 million was short-term or floating debt, mainly in the form of 91-day
bills on the Treasury, while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds,
loans, and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest (varying from to 4 per cent)
and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
Since the war new lending by the Government has exceeded loan repayment, as
the main borrowers, the local authorities, repay over a long term. From 1945 to the
end of 1952 local authorities relied on the Exchequer for virtually all their loans. As
from 1st January 1953 they were given permission to borrow on the open market
(see p. 65).
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It consists of
a Central Bank; of Commercial Banks which carry on the usual main banking
services; of the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main business is in
other countries; and of various specialized banks and similar financial institutions.
The Bank of England
The Bank of England is the Central Bank and its principal business is to act as
banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the Government
for important financial operations and as the central note-issuing authority; it
maintains relations with central banks overseas. It was established in 1694 by Act
of Parliament as a corporate body and its entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act, 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England acts in conjunction with other banks and
financial institutions in co-ordinating the application of the Government’s monetary
policy. One of the main instruments for this purpose is the Bank Rate—the rate at
which the Bank of England will discount approved bills of exchange. The Bank
Rate was raised from 2 to 2^ per cent in November 1951 and to 4 per cent in March
1952; it was reduced to 3$ per cent in September 1953, and to 3 per cent in May
I954-
As banker to the Government the Bank of England holds the main Government
accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and registration of
Government loans. It also operates, for the Treasury, the administration of
exchange control which has been in force since 1939 (see pp. 282-4).
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
256
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England and
these balances form part of the bankers’ cash reserves.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing bank
notes, which are, of course, legal tender throughout the United Kingdom. Notes
thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities, the part covered by the
latter being the ‘Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to parliamentary
control. In practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Department of the
Bank of England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign exchange)
reserves being in a separate account, known as the Exchange Equalization Account,
originally established in 1932 for the purpose of checking undue fluctuation in the
exchange value of sterling. The provision of coin for circulation is the responsibility
of a Government Department, the Royal Mint.
The Commercial Banks
The banks handling the major part of the domestic banking business in the
United Kingdom are, in the main, limited liability companies which are subject to
the ordinary law relating to such companies.
Some of the main distinguishing features of the United Kingdom commercial
banks are:
1. A relatively small number of banks control a large number of branches.
Domestic banking members of the British Bankers’ Association number 27,
including 7 in Scotland, and 3 in Northern Ireland; these banks control
nearly 12,500 branches and have total assets of over £8,000 million.
2. The volume of cheques handled is very large and, in spite of a stamp duty
of 2d. on each cheque, many payments—and even relatively small payments
. —are made by cheque. The average daily value of cheques, drafts, bills and
bankers’ effects cleared in 1954 through the London and Provincial Clear¬
ing Houses was £478 million; and many cheques do not, for various
reasons, pass through Clearing Houses.
3. It is the practice of the chief United Kingdom banks to maintain a ratio of
about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total deposits (of which about
two-thirds are repayable on demand, the remainder being deposits at
interest and subject to notice).
In September 1954 about 35 per cent of the banks’ deposits were covered
by cash and short-term securities while longer-term securities amounted to
about 34 per cent, and advances to customers to about 28 per cent of total
deposits. It is not the practice of British banks to participate directly in
industry, the financing of which is, as far as they are concerned, normally
limited to short-term advances.
4. Certain banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained limited rights
to issue notes; these issues must, apart from an amount for each bank which is
specified by legislation, be fully covered by Bank of England notes and by coin.
United Kingdom Offices of Banks Operating Mainly Overseas
The importance of London as a financial and trading centre and as the largest
city of the British Commonwealth has encouraged many banks whose main business
is in the Commonwealth and other countries to have London offices; in some cases,
indeed, the institutions concerned are United Kingdom companies and the London
office is the head office. These London offices form part of the complex structure
engaged in the financing of trade not only between the United Kingdom and other
countries but also in goods which are shipped direct between other countries.

Savings Banks and the National Savings Movement
The function of Trustee and Post Office Savings Banks is to provide facilities for
the investment of voluntary savings and particularly of the small savings of persons
with small incomes. Both these types of banks were well established during the
nineteenth century. The growth of their business was, however, encouraged in the
first world war when the War Savings Committee was set up under Government
auspices to promote an official savings drive. A new type of long-term security for
the small investor was inaugurated at that time. This was the National Savings
Certificate, with interest payable only on encashment, but free of income tax. From
this war-time drive originated the present National Savings Movement devoted to
the encouragement of the widespread investment of savings in Trustee and Post
Office Savings Banks and in National Savings Certificates and Defence Bonds. The
policy of the movement is determined by the National Savings Committee for
England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The committees are bodies of independent persons representing regional savings
organizations and various national institutions connected with such matters as
finance, industry and education. They are assisted by a salaried staff of civil
servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often assisted or promoted by local
authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings groups.
Trustee Savings Banks are managed by boards of honorary trustees and managers,
and most of the funds deposited with them are ordinary deposits which are with¬
drawable on demand or at short notice. These deposits are invested with the
National Debt Commissioners, and the Government is responsible to the trustees
for the repayment of the money so invested with accrued interest as and when
required. Trustee Savings Banks also accept, in certain circumstances, deposits for
special investment. These deposits, which may receive a slightly higher rate of
interest than ordinary deposits, are invested under the supervision of the National
Debt Commissioners, but the Government is not responsible to the trustees for the
repayment of these investments. Trustee Savings Banks are particularly flourishing
in small towns. At the end of 1953 there were about 1,280 Trustee Offices con¬
trolled by 84 independent banks.
The Post Office Savings Bank is the largest organization of its kind in the world.
It has over 22 million active accounts; in October 1954 total balances, which carry a
Government guarantee, amounted to £1,742 million, about £80 per depositor.
Through a centralized system of accounting, a depositor can pay in money or make
a withdrawal at any one of some 19,000 post offices throughout the country.
To ensure that Savings Banks are used primarily by the small investor there is a
limit of £500 on the amount which may be deposited by any individual in one year,
and of £3,000 on the total balance which may be held by one individual. The
maximum amount of National Savings Certificates which may be held by any
one person is £750 worth of the current (ninth) issue and about £1,875 worth of
all issues. The limit on individual holdings of 3^ per cent Defence Bonds
(Subscription Issue) is £2,000.
Co-operative Banks
The Co-operative Wholesale Society (see footnote, p. 288) formed a deposit and
loan department about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to
engage in banking was legally defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act
m 1876. The primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank was to
serve the Co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has become, but the
bank has also come to include among its clients trade unions and other mutual
societies, local authorities and individual depositors.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
258
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities, which are
supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are mainly provided
through the Discount Market, Finance Corporations, the Stock Exchange, Invest¬
ment Trusts, Building Societies and the Insurance Market. New issues, except for
certain small operations, are controlled by the Treasury with the advice of the
Capital Issues Committee (see p. 260).
The firms engaged in this business are in the main highly specialized, e.g.,
discount houses, accepting houses, stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters
and brokers. In addition to these specialist firms, however, there is a class of bank,
the merchant bank, which has been of great importance in the finance of trade and
commodity dealings and in the flotation of major issues of bonds, particularly for
oversea concerns and governments.
The merchant banks helped to give London an international reputation as the
main world centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. Long-term loans for
development purposes created a continuing claim for interest and attracted to
Britain a steady flow of orders for machinery, textiles and coal. This increasing
trade was usually financed by bills of exchange, which were traded on the discount
market and provided an easy method of transferring debts and claims.
The Discount Market
The main business of the Discount Market consists of trading in and holding
commercial bills of exchange, United Kingdom Government Treasury Bills and
other short-term securities.
To the extent to which the various firms which compose the Discount Market
have insufficient funds of their own to finance the bills and securities which they
wish to hold, they obtain loans from the banks and, to a lesser extent, deposits
from the public. In the main these loans and deposits may be called in at any
time.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury Bills at the
weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but purchase, from the Discount
Market, bills which have been taken up by the market and held until they become
of a currency required by the banks.
If the banks call in loans which they have made to the Discount Market and the
latter is unable to cover its needs elsewhere, it will be forced to borrow from the
Bank of England. It is not the practice of the commercial banks themselves to
obtain direct loans from the Bank of England to augment their cash resources if the
need arises.
Finance Corporations
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in 1945 in
order to assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and develop¬
ment. Although the Government displayed considerable interest in their formation,
the Corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies with no official repre¬
sentation on the boards and having no recourse to public funds. Another finance
corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited, was
incorporated in 1953 for the purpose of assisting development projects within the
Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations of note are Air Finance
Limited and the National Film Finance Corporation.

Finance Corporation for Industry Limited
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of £200,000
and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of industry with a view to
promoting efficiency and thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase of
employment.
The Corporation has an authorized and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of £125
million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance companies,
30 per cent by trust companies and 30 per cent by the Bank of England. As at the
31st March 1954 the capital had been paid up to the extent of 2 per cent (£500,000),
the liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital representing
security to the banks who provide the capital out of which the Corporation makes
its advances.
The enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
e.g., diesel engines, permanent prefabricated houses, shipping, electrical com¬
ponents, steel, oil, chemicals, etc.
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited
The ICFC is smaller than the FCI and has as its main object the provision of
credit and finance by means of loan capital and share capital for industrial and com¬
mercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases where the existing facilities
provided by banking institutions and the Stock Exchange are not readily or easily
available.
The authorized and issued share capital of the Corporation is £15 million which
is paid up as required; the Corporation can borrow up to a further £30 million and
can thus have a maximum of £45 million available. Although the Bank of England
has a token participation, the principal shareholders are the London Clearing
Banks and the Scottish Banks in proportion to their size; the loan capital is pro¬
vided by all the shareholders in the same ratio as their shareholdings.
The nature of the Corporation’s business is to provide finance in sums ranging
between £5,000 and £200,000 for small and medium-sized concerns. It has a large
number of customers and has established branches in Birmingham, Manchester
and Edinburgh.
Commonwealth Development Finance Company Limited
This Company was established early in 1953. It originated from the Conference
of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in December 1952 and its purpose is to finance
development schemes in the British Commonwealth. The authorized capital of this
company is £15 million but to begin with only £2-9 million has been called up; the
Company is empowered to borrow up to twice its issued capital.
Air Finance Limited
This Company was formed by a group of bankers and the FCI late in 1953 for
the purpose of financing aircraft exports. Its initial resources were £11 million.
The National Film Finance Corporation1
The Corporation is a statutory body established under the Cinematograph Film
Production (Special Loans) Act, 1949. Its function is to make loans to film pro¬
ducers and distributors in order to help to finance the production of films.

The Stock Exchanges
Although there are several Stock Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the London
Stock Exchange is by far the most important.
The Stock Exchanges provide a means by which a holder of quoted stock or
shares (all important securities are quoted) can, if he wishes, find a buyer for his
securities; they are also a most important element in the raising of new capital by
Government and commercial borrowers.
The Stock Exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains are
made between members reflect the interaction of supply of and demand for the
securities concerned.
All the Stock Exchanges operate under strict rules of conduct which they make
themselves.
The Capital Issues Committee
Since 1932 there has been control to a greater or lesser degree over capital issues
in the United Kingdom. The 1932 controls, and such modifications as were made
up to 1939, were without a statutory basis but resulted from public requests by the
Chancellor which the various markets observed. At the outbreak of war in 1939 the
Foreign Transactions (Advisory) Committee, which had been set up in 1936 to
advise the Treasury on issues involving remittances to countries outside the
Commonwealth, was renamed the Capital Issues Committee and was given the
wider task of advising the Treasury on the administration of the statutory control
of capital issues (and analogous transactions) for which provision was made in
Regulation 6 of the Defence (Finance) Regulations, 1939.
The end of the war in 1945 saw the retention of the Capital Issues Committee
with its primary function unchanged; permanent provision for capital issues control
was made the following year with the passing of the Borrowing (Control and
Guarantees) Act, 1946.
The Committee is entirely independent of Government Departments and con¬
sists of seven men of experience in commerce, industry or finance, who consider
applications to raise loans or issue capital (except those not involving more than
£50,000 in any one year for the borrower concerned) and tender their advice to the
Treasury upon them.
Investment Trusts
Investment trusts cater for the investor who does not wish or has not sufficient
resources to hold a large number of investments in his own name but who desires
to have an interest in several securities as a means of spreading his risk.
The ordinary type of investment trust is a public company, limited in liability
and registered under the Companies Acts; investment trusts in this form have been
established in the United Kingdom for about a century. They invest their share
and loan capital over a range of securities, the precise choice depending in part
on the objects of the particular company concerned.
Since 1931 there have also been ‘unit trusts’ in the United Kingdom; a trust of
this type is normally limited by its trust deed to a specified range of securities. The
original conception of the unit trust was that securities could be grouped in fixed
proportions to form units, and these units could be divided into sub-units which
could be sold to the public. In practice, while retaining this unit basis of investment,
many unit trusts have considerable flexibility in their choice of the underlying
securities.
FINANCE
26l
The Insurance Market
The British insurance market is in the main divided into two parts, the insurance
companies and Lloyd’s. The company market is the larger, but Lloyd’s is older and
has a greater claim on the popular imagination. The company market consists of
about 300 British insurance offices, chiefly incorporated under the Companies Acts,
of which some two-thirds are small or of local or specialized significance, whereas
the remainder transact a general business. Most of the latter are controlled by
about 30 very large companies of international repute. In addition, some 200 over¬
sea companies are represented, emphasizing the international nature of the insurance
market. The natural focus of the market is in London, although some of the largest
offices have their administrative centres elsewhere. In addition, there are some 150
Friendly and Collecting Societies devoted solely to ‘industrial* life assurance1
throughout the country, but these are not part of the insurance market proper.
Lloyd's
Lloyd’s is an association of individual underwriters who group themselves into
syndicates. The conduct of insurance business at Lloyd’s is regulated by the
Committee of Lloyd’s, and the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate
capacity are administered by the Committee under an Act of Parliament. In
addition to its insurance activities Lloyd’s maintains a world-wide organization for
the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence (see p. 189). Although in its
earlier history the activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine
insurance business, during the last fifty years there has been built up at Lloyd’s a
very considerable world-wide market for the transaction of other classes of
insurance.
The market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the
insured, who are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a valuable part of the
company market. Many brokers specialize in reinsurance business, acting as inter¬
mediaries in the exchange of contracts between both British and oversea companies,
and often acting as London representatives of the latter.
Volume of Business
The volume of premium income business transacted by the insurance market
during the year 1953 was about £1,000 million.
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine business comes from abroad,
partly by direct placing in London and partly from branch and agency offices
established in over 100 countries. The profits on this business, together with
interest earned on funds maintained locally, have produced in recent years a sub¬
stantial sum in foreign exchange, of which a large part was represented by dollars.
The basic principle of international business is that resources capable of meeting
any potential loss are instantly available for application wherever necessary.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the assets of the
companies, aggregating over £3,000 million in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and
personal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters. British insurers hold over £1,200 million
in British Government and other public stocks, while about £900 million is invested
in ordinary shares, preference shares and debentures in industry, mostly in the
United Kingdom.

intervals of less than two months (a system convenient to weekly wage earners).

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Building Societies
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on the
security of private dwelling houses purchased for owner-occupation, though loans
are occasionally made on the security of commercial and industrial premises and
farms. The funds of building societies are derived mainly from the general public
who invest in shares or deposits. The amount of share capital is not fixed but may
be regulated in accordance with the amount of mortgage business; shares are not
dealt with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The rapid expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a few very
large societies. At the end of 1953 there were in operation a total of 782 societies,
whose total assets were £1,642 million. The amount advanced on mortgage in
1953 was £298 million.
IX. TRADE
EXTERNAL TRADE
British oversea markets and sources of supply are world-wide. The wealth and
very existence of the British people has, for over a century, depended on oversea
trade. British imports consist mainly of food and of the various materials, raw and
processed, required by British industries, though finished capital and consumer
goods are also imported. British exports are preponderantly of manufactured goods,
but coal and raw wool are also important exports.
For over one hundred years the value of goods imported into Britain has
exceeded that of goods exported, the balance of imports being more than paid
for in normal years by net invisible exports—i.e. the net receipts of interest,
dividends and profits on previous investment abroad and net income from shipping,
insurance and a variety of financial services; and the net overall surplus has been
invested overseas. This is the broad picture: it has been modified in detail over
the course of time.
TRENDS SINCE 1938
The post-war years have witnessed a rapid expansion in the volume of exports,
to a level considerably higher than in 1938. This has been a consequence of rising
production and restricted home consumption in combination with a vigorous
export drive. Imports, on the other hand, have been less in volume and re-exports
have shown a declining trend. Apart from these changes in quantity, prices of both
imports and exports are much higher than before the war and there have also been
important changes in commodity composition and area distribution.
Some indication of the increased importance of exports in the national economy
is shown by the rise in the proportion of total national income derived from
export earnings—from 10-4 per cent in 1938 to 13 per cent in 1947 and 18-3 per
cent in 1953. Over the same period the rise in the proportion of expenditure on
imports to total national expenditure was smaller—from 18 per cent in 1938 to
19-4 per cent in 1947 and 22-8 per cent in 1953.
Changes in the value and volume of external trade as a whole are shown in
Table 38. Imports rose in value from £919 million in 1938 to £1,794 million in
1947 and £3,345 million in 1953. The rise in value of exports was from £47J million
in 1938 to £1,139 million in 1947 and £2,582 million in 1953.
Calculations of changes in the quantity of external trade compared with pre-war
cannot be made with precision as the relative values of different classes of goods
on which the volume figures are based have changed considerably since 1938-
Broadly speaking, however, the volume of imports in 1947 was a quarter less than
before the war; by 1953 it had nearly regained the pre-war level. The volume of
exports in 1953 was about 70 per cent higher than in 1938.
Commodity Composition
As compared with pre-war, exports of motor vehicles, aircraft, machinery,
chemicals and electrical goods have greatly increased in importance, while the
older staples, such as cotton and wool textiles, though still considerable, have taken
a declining share in the export total. Before the war Britain s coal exports averaged
about 35—40 million tons a year and imports were negligible; between 1951 anc^
1953 the average export figure was about 11 million tons, while imports averaged
about 5 million tons.

Area Distribution
The area distribution of external trade in 1938 and 1947 in comparison with that
of 1953 is shown in the two parts of Table 42. Imports from North America, which
were 22 per cent of the total value of imports in 1938, rose to 30 per cent in 1947
but declined to 17 per cent in 1953. Imports from the sterling area, on the other
hand, rose from 31 per cent in 1947 to 45 per cent in 1953. Total exports to North
America showed a small percentage increase in 1953 as compared with 1947 and
1938. Exports and re-exports to the sterling area rose from 45 per cent in 1938 to
49 per cent in 1947 but decreased to 47 per cent in 1953. Imports from non¬
sterling member countries of the Organization for European Economic Co-opera¬
tion (OEEC) and their oversea territories showed an appreciable rise between 1947
and 1953—from 17 per cent to 23 per cent of the total.

THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s main economic problem after 1945 was to pay her way with fewer
resources than before the war in a world where prices were turning against her.
Exports were expanded and imports and home consumption restricted. Financial
assistance on a large scale was received from the United States and Canada, and in
1950 recovery appeared to be such that the decision was taken to discontinue
Marshall Aid. The Korean War, however, started a further adverse swing of prices,
and much more had to be spent on defence. In 1951 there was again a large pay¬
ments deficit. Since 1951, the terms of trade have improved. With this help, plus
United States Defence Aid and import cuts, the United Kingdom was again in
surplus in 1952; and 1953 proved to be a year of consolidation.
Reconstruction and Recovery 1945-50
Although exports expanded rapidly after the war Britain was able to maintain an
adequate level of imports between 1945 and 1947 only by drawing heavily on the
gold and dollar re$erves and op the lines of credit granted by the United States
TRADE
271
in December 1945, and by Canada in March 1946. Between the beginning of 1946
and the middle of 1948 the whole of the United States credit of $3,750 million
was drawn, but drawings upon the Canadian credit of $1,250 million continued
until the middle of 1950 by which time $1,185 million had been taken up. From
1948 onwards, United States dollars, made available under the European Recovery
Programme (ERP), and subsequently under the United States Mutual Defence
Assistance and Mutual Aid Programmes, gave economic support directly to
Britain and the rest of Europe and indirectly to the rest of the sterling area1 and
the rest of the world. At the same time the Organization for European Economic
Co-operation (OEEC), set up in April 1948, undertook the administration of dollar
aid on the European side and helped to stimulate recovery by encouraging self-help
and co-operative action amongst the European member countries.
In 1949 there was a serious drain on the sterling area’s gold and dollar reserves,
partly as a result of a recession in business activity in the United States. To protect
these reserves the United Kingdom Government reduced the exchange value of
sterling, on 18th September 1949, from $4,03 to $2-80. This, followed by industrial
recovery in America and elsewhere arising from the trade boom following the
1 The essence of the sterling area is the readiness of its members generally to keep
most of their monetary reserves in the form of sterling in London and to use London as their
banker. They satisfy their needs for other currencies by drawing on the sterling area pool,
paying for them out of their sterling holdings. The sterling area now consists of the
British Commonwealth (except Canada), British Trust Territories, British Protectorates
and Protected States, together with the Irish Republic, Burma, Iceland, Iraq, Jordan and
Libya. Iceland does not draw on the sterling area pool but meets her dollar needs inde¬
pendently. The sterling area as a whole accounts for about a third of world trade.

272
outbreak of the Korean war, helped to bring about a marked improvement in the
sterling area’s dollar position in 1950. By December of that year the improvement
in the sterling area’s gold and dollar reserves was such that allocations of dollar
aid to Britain under the European Recovery Programme were suspended. The
total amount of ERP aid allotted to the United Kingdom up to this date was
$2,694 million in grants and loans, of which a small part was not received until
1951-
Deficit Problems 1950-52
The improvement of 1950 was, however, followed in 1951 t>y a serious balance
of payments crisis which affected both the United Kingdom itself and the sterling
area as a whole. This was due in part to the steep falls in the prices of sterling area
raw materials from the peak levels of early I951) and in part to substantial increases
in imports by the sterling area from the non-sterling world. It resulted in a loss of
gold and dollar reserves of £550 million in the second half of 1951-
For the United Kingdom, and for the whole sterling area, the year 1952 was
dominated by the need to check this crisis. Immediate stop-gap measures, including
steps to curtail internal demand and measures to limit imports, were taken by the
United Kingdom in November 1951. In January 1952, at a meeting of Common¬
wealth Finance Ministers, action was agreed upon to bring the sterling area into
balance with the rest of the world in the second half of i952> stop the drain on
the gold and dollar reserves and to eliminate inflation.
These immediate aims were accomplished. Even without taking United States
Defence Aid into account the sterling area had a substantial surplus with the
TRADE
273
non-sterling world in the second half of 1952, and the United Kingdom was also
in current surplus with the non-sterling world during the same period. The drain
of gold and dollars was stopped and the reserves rose a little during the second
half of the year. An important factor in the strengthening of the reserves was
United States Defence Aid, receipts of which totalled £121 million in 1952. On the
other hand, the United Kingdom paid out nearly £75 million during the year
in interest and amortization on the United States and Canadian loans.
Consolidation in 1953
In 1953 the improvement in the sterling area’s external position was consolidated.
Although exports to the dollar area declined as a result of a trade recession in
the United States, imports from the dollar area fell even more, and the dollar
balance showed an improvement. At the same time, there was a marked improve¬
ment in the sterling area’s balance with non-dollar countries. In consequence, the
gold and dollar reserves rose by £240 million during the year. At the end of
October 1954 the reserves had risen to £1,049 million compared with the low level
°f £594 million in April 1952 and the peak of £1,381 million reached in June 1951.
The balance of payments of the United Kingdom with the rest of the world is
set out in Table 43, which shows how a deficit on visible trade has been offset since
1950 (with the exception of 1951) by a surplus on invisible trade. In 1952 and 1953
the United Kingdom had a surplus with other sterling countries, and a deficit
(excluding Aid) elsewhere, while other sterling countries had a deficit with the
United Kingdom and a surplus with non-sterling countries.

Visible Account.1 The trade figures indicate that in 1953 Britain bought 9 per
cent more imports, by volume, than in 1952, but because of the fall in import
prices paid 4 per cent less for them. Britain exported 3 per cent more goods than
in 1952, but because of the fall in export prices earned about the same as in the
previous year. Import prices, however, fell much more than export prices; and
this improved the balance of payments by some £200-250 million.
Invisibles. Oil transactions made a large contribution to the improvement of
invisible earnings; shipping expenditure was sharply reduced and earnings less so;
Government receipts rose. On the other hand receipts on account of interest,
profits and dividends (chiefly from the Rest of the Sterling Area) fell off.

The reduction in the import bill contributed £141 million to the improvement
in the current balance with the non-sterling areas, and higher net invisible earnings
£91 million. Exports and re-exports were £41 million and Defence Aid £19
million less in 1953 than 1952. Higher imports were responsible for £70 million and
lower exports and re-exports for £116 million of the deterioration vis-a-vis the
sterling countries. Export earnings had reached a peak in the first half of 1952,
falling rapidly in the second half of that year, largely as a result of the restrictions
many sterling countries had to impose for balance of payments reasons. Exports
have recovered from the low level of that period, and were expanding towards the
end of 1953, when some of the countries concerned, in particular Australia, had
found it possible to relax their restrictions again. But the peak of early 1952 was
not regained.
Improvement in the First Half of 1954
In the first half of 1954, the United Kingdom had a balance of payments
surplus on current account of £178 million including £24 million of Defence
Aid from the United States. Table 46 shows how this compares with results in
the two preceding half years.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The reasons for the improvement in the first half of 1954 compared with the
average of the two halves of 1953 were:
(1) visible exports were £91 million greater, a 7 per cent increase;
(2) imports rose only by £32 million, or 2 per cent;
(3) net invisible earnings were £4° million more although half this improve¬
ment was accounted for by the fact that in the first half of the year there
are no large interest payments on the United States and Canadian loans
respectively.
Short-Term Capital Position
Since 1951 there has also been an improvement in Britain’s short-term capital
position, which is important for assessing the strength of sterling. This improve¬
ment is indicated by the changes in the relationship of assets (gold and dollar
reserves) to sterling liabilities given in Table 47.

For the sterling area as a whole the relationship of assets to non-sterling
liabilities deteriorated by £623 million in 1951 and then improved by £60 million
in 1952, £271 million in 1953 and £208 million in the first half of 1954.
United Kingdom Post-War Aid to Other Countries
As against the aid received from external sources after the war, the United
Kingdom made available considerable sums to other countries. Between 1st January
1946 and 31st December 1952 the amount spent by the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment on assistance in the form of loans and grants to other countries, including
United Kingdom dependencies, and to international organizations was £i,5°4
million. Loans and grants received by the United Kingdom in the same period
amounted to £2,556 million.
Oversea Investment
With the progress of post-war recovery, Britain has been able to resume its
role as a source of funds for investment in development overseas, particularly in
the Commonwealth. Thus, between 1947 and 1953, the Governments of Member
Countries of the sterling area Commonwealth raised loans in London totalling
about £67 million while Governments of United Kingdom Dependencies raised
loans totalling over £ 100 million. Development in the sterling area Commonwealth
is also being assisted through the Commonwealth Development Finance Company
Ltd., (see p. 259), with a share capital of £15 million contributed by the Bank of
England and 91 industrial, mining, shipping and banking companies. For the same
TRADE
277
purpose, the United Kingdom Government has agreed to allow £10 million a year
for six years to be available for Commonwealth investment from its contribution
to the International Bank, and in 1953 it granted a credit of £10 million to Pakistan
through the Export Credits Guarantee Department (see p. 280). Private capital from
Britain going into private oversea enterprises has, of course, always represented an
important element in Commonwealth development, although it is not possible to
measure its extent with any accuracy since only those investments which involve
raising new money are subject to any control. The total flow of private capital
into private oversea enterprises has been at a substantial rate since the war,
although with some variations between different years and in distribution as between
different countries. In the case of Canada—a dollar country—participation by
United Kingdom investors in that country’s economic development has been
facilitated in various ways, and in 1953 private investment in Canada was
authorized to the extent of £38 million. In addition, the investment of smaller
amounts in the United States and other foreign countries was authorized.
It has recently been estimated that the average figures for United Kingdom
long-term investment overseas (excluding inter-Government lending, but including
United Kingdom Government loans for commercial projects and borrowing by
oversea Governments in the London Market) are:
UK gross investment overseas . .
Less:
UK disinvestment overseas; and oversea net
investment in the United Kingdom . .

Current Policies
The current policy of the United Kingdom and the sterling area Commonwealth
countries was discussed in the communique issued at the close of the Conference
of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in January 1954. Three objectives were
listed: (1) the maintenance of a strong balance of payments position and the
strengthening of the reserves; (2) sound internal policies on which ‘depend the
purchasing power of money, the cost of living and the ability to sell exports in
increasingly competitive markets’; and (3) the development of resources, with
particular emphasis ‘on the development of those resources which directly or
indirectly contribute on an economic basis towards improving the balance of
payments of the sterling area’. In the matter of financing development, the United
Kingdom has undertaken to make a special effort in the knowledge that this,
added to other oversea commitments on account of military expenditure, debt
repayments, etc., requires an increase in current account earnings.
These objectives are to be pursued in the context of proposals designed ‘to bring
about the widest possible system of multilateral trade and payments, the reduc¬
tion and progressive elimination of import restrictions, and the convertibility
of sterling and other important currencies’. These proposals, known as the
‘collective approach’, are based on the need for ‘collective action by debtor and
creditor countries to bring about a balance in the world economy on the basis of
“trade, not aid” ’. Considerable progress has been made towards freer trade and
payments; in facilitating these objectives convertibility of currencies will be a
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
278
major instrument and not an end in itself. Necessary conditions for further
decisive action have been stated to be: (1) progress in Europe in moving from
the present European Payments Union to a system in which some countries
currencies will be convertible but not those of others; (2) consolidating and further¬
ing the real progress of the sterling area towards useful development, internal
balance and adequate foreign exchange resources; (3) carrying forward the United
States Administration’s trade liberalization policies, so that the dollar-eaming oppor¬
tunities of other countries can be increased; (4) developing more elastic methods of
co-operation between the International Monetary Fund and its members; and
(5) revising, confirming and carrying forward the trade rules of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
CONDUCT OF EXTERNAL TRADE
The export trade and most of the import trade of the United Kingdom is
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the industry
the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export trade, especially
of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through export merchants in
the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to importers and consumers
abroad through their own agents or resident representatives in the countries con¬
cerned ; in other cases, sales are made through a firm’s own branch office, distribut¬
ing organization or subsidiary sales company established in oversea markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or domestic
trade buy directly from oversea suppliers, while smaller firms may find it more
convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export houses, commis¬
sion agents, and the representatives of oversea firms.
Commodity Markets
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world s basic com¬
modities. These markets were largely closed during the war but they have gradually
been re-opened and are rapidly regaining their previous position. Amongst the
more important are the London Rubber Market, the London Wool Exchange,
the London Metal Exchange and the Liverpool Cotton Exchange. Apart from
the import of goods for home consumption, many transactions are arranged
between buyers and sellers from other countries and the British markets play
an important part in merchanting and distributing commodities throughout
the world.
Re-export Trade
Re-exports are goods which are exported (a) in the condition in which they
are imported or (6) after having undergone minor operations—e.g., simple blending,
husking, repacking—which leave them essentially unchanged. For some hundreds
of years Britain has been an important centre of re-export trade though, over the
past forty years, its importance relative to total United Kingdom export trade has
declined. The greater part of united Kingdom re-export trade has always been
in raw materials and foodstuffs, e.g., wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals and
furskins. Traditionally, re-export commodities are imported from Commonwealth
countries and re-exported to countries in Europe.
London’s Part in the Finance of International Trade
In the financing of international trade, both visible and invisible, the part played
by the City of London is of outstanding importance. By a process of evolution
TRADE
279
through the centuries ‘the City’ has developed an efficient and adaptable organiza¬
tion of trade and financial services capable of meeting the needs, not only of Britain,
but of the world in general. The supremacy of London in this respect derives from
a number of factors—historical, geographical and economic—as well as the technical
efficiency and low cost of its services. In the nineteenth century the rapid growth
of British industry, commerce and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial
revolution made Britain the market as well as the workshop of the world. It
became the site for the chief world markets in raw materials, freight, insurance,
and precious metals. At the same time British capital was invested in oversea
countries to assist their development, increase their output and exports, and pro¬
vide markets for manufactured goods. London became the chief supplier of
capital for many Commonwealth and foreign governments and a centre for
entrepot trade proceeding to and from the growing industrial areas on the continent
of Europe and in North America. In course of time the pound sterling and the
sterling bill of exchange developed into the principal form of money for transactions
between one country and another in all parts of the world. Britain is now the
banker for the sterling area and sterling is used in the finance of nearly half the
world’s international transactions.
Side by side with these developments a sound commercial banking system and a
flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while specialized institu¬
tions such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the Stock
Exchange, investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy
particular needs of short- or long-term finance (see pp. 258-60). The facilities pro¬
vided by merchant banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used
to finance shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but between any two
outside countries.
Despite the dislocations of two world wars and the growth of economic national¬
ism in the twentieth century, London has retained its supremacy as an international
centre for the provision of financial and trade services. Its reputation has been
enhanced in recent years by the recovery in the sterling area’s gold and dollar
reserves, the improvement in Britain’s balance of payments and the removal of
restrictions on trade and financial operations.
Government Assistance to Oversea Trade
The United Kingdom Government provides a service of information and advice
to merchants and manufacturers in the export trade. The Government Department
most concerned is the Board of Trade, which calls upon the assistance of oversea
representatives. At each Embassy or Legation there is always an officer of high
rank, a Minister, Counsellor or First Secretary (Commercial), who specializes in
commercial matters. These officers direct the commercial activities of Consular
officers in their respective territories.
In the Commonwealth there is at every important centre an officer of the Trade
Commissioner Service, who is directly responsible to the Board of Trade.
Oversea officers regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions,
pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities, and generally
assist the exporter to overcome the difficulties he encounters in trade with the
country in question, particularly those arising out of governmental regulations.
These officers indicate potential demand for United Kingdom products, advise
about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out and pass on all
opportunities for export business and inquiries for United Kingdom goods.
Assistance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in finding agents and likely
importers. From the records the Department keeps in London, brought up to date
T
28o
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by reports from its oversea officers, it can provide information concerning any
country on:
(1) prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
(2) government regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions and
tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
(3) methods of trading;
(4) goods most likely to sell;
(5) local tastes and preferences in design;
(6) probity and influence of firms with which an exporter contemplates enter¬
ing into business relations.
Export Credit Insurance
The Export Credits Guarantee Department is a Government agency run on
commercial lines to provide insurance for United Kingdom exporters and mer¬
chants against the main risks of financial loss incurred in oversea trading. These
facilities have been developed over a period of more than thirty years, and there are
now over 3,500 policy holders on the Department’s books. The Department under¬
writes some £500 million worth of insurance a year.
The risks covered range over a wide field, and include events such as insolvency
or prolonged default on the part of the buyer; exchange restrictions preventing
the transfer of sterling to the United Kingdom; war; civil war in the buyer’s
country; and any other cause of loss occurring outside the United Kingdom which
is beyond the control of the exporter or the buyer. The risk of cancellation or
non-renewal of an export licence in the United Kingdom, or the imposition of
restrictions on the export of goods not previously subject to licence, is also covered.
Broadly speaking, the types of guarantee issued are divided into three main
categories:
(1) Short-term Policies, which cover mainly consumer goods sold on credit
terms of up to six months; these are normally given on a whole turnover
basis. In addition to direct United Kingdom exports, cover may be given
for goods of foreign origin sold by a United Kingdom merchant to third
countries, provided this trade does not conflict with direct United Kingdom
exports. Cover may commence either from the date of the contract or from
the date of shipment.
(2) Medium-term Policies, which cover capital and other goods sold on credit
terms of over six months. These are specific guarantees covering indi¬
vidual contracts.
(3) Dollar-Drive Policies, which have been specially devised to assist exports
to Canada, the United States and the Latin American dollar account
countries. In addition to the standard types of policies included under (1)
and (2), special policies have been written to assist exporters to enter
or increase their business in these markets by means of market surveys,
advertising and other forms of sales promotion, and stockholding. This
special cover can be offered from the time of purchase of raw materials to
the point of sale, and if desired on a ‘joint venture’ basis. The Department
is ready to consider any reasonable and soundly based proposition which
may be put forward by an exporter with a view to increasing United
Kingdom sales to these markets.
In the case of all the Department’s policies, the exporter or merchant is required
to retain an interest in the debt or risk involved, and consequently guarantees

are given up to a maximum of 90 per cent. Premium rates are assessed separately for
each country, and vary according to the risks and terms of payment. These are very
moderate in relation to the magnitude of the risks which the Department is now
covering, and to the payments made by way of claims.
Trade Fairs
The British Industries Fair (BIF) is the largest national trade fair held regularly
in any country. It was first held in 1915, and brought together 591 exhibitors who
occupied 88,000 square feet. The Fair has since been an annual event except for a
break in 1925 and again from 1940 to 1947. Since 1947 it has consisted of exhibits
by manufacturers within the United Kingdom and representative displays by
the Governments of Commonwealth countries.
Part of the BIF is held at Olympia, London; and part is held simultaneously at
Castle Bromwich, Birmingham.
Under the British Industries Fair (Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1954, the
responsibility for the BIF has been transferred as from 1955 from the Board of
Trade to a non-profit-making company (British Industries Fair, Ltd.) whose
board is nominated by trustees representative of industry. The initial working
capital for this company has been guaranteed by the Government for a period of
five years. Management of the Birmingham section of the fair is to remain with
the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.
Apart from United Kingdom buyers, 125,392 buyers from countries overseas
have attended the BIF in the eight years since its revival in 1947. The 1954 Fair
attracted nearly 2,270 manufacturers, who exhibited the products of more than 90
industries. The exhibits were grouped in sections of closely allied trades, and
occupied nearly 712,000 square feet.
In addition to the British Industries Fair, which serves industry generally,
there are many specialized trade fairs held in the United Kingdom. The most
important of these, such as the Motor Show, the Mechanical Handling Exhibition
and the Radio and Television Show, attract large numbers of the public as well
as many trade buyers from home and overseas. These specialized fairs provide
an important means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom manufacturers show their goods at most of the large inter¬
national trade fairs throughout the world. For example, more than 300 United
Kingdom firms were represented at the 1954 Milan Fair and also at the 1954
Brussels Fair. At the more important of these international trade fairs there is an
official United Kingdom export promotion stand to deal with trade inquiries. In
addition to taking part in these international events, there are specially organized
displays of British goods: a successful trade fair of this sort was organized in
Zurich in 1953 by the British Chamber of Commerce for Switzerland, and the
Federation of British Industries organized a British Trade Fair in Baghdad in 1954-
Tourist Trade
The general task of fostering and developing the tourist trade or tourist services
is undertaken by the British Travel and Holidays Association (BTHA) which was
established in 1950. The BTHA was formed by merging two organizations, the
British Tourist and Holiday Board and the Travel Association.
Control over the Association’s affairs is vested in a Board of which the Chairman
and eight members are appointed by the Board of Trade, while other members
represent various tourist interests.1

pondence should be addressed, is at 64/65 St. James s Street, London, o.W.i.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are no restrictions on the amounts of sterling that United Kingdom
tourists visiting sterling area countries may take with them. For visits to non-sterling
countries outside the dollar area United Kingdom tourists are entitled to take a
basic foreign currency allowance of £100 per twelve-month period. Special arrange¬
ments apply to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands:
United Kingdom tourists visiting these countries are allowed all reasonable
amounts of currency.
In past years United Kingdom travel expenditure in other countries has usually
exceeded United Kingdom earnings from visitors to the United Kingdom. In
1953, however, expenditure roughly balanced with earnings. The number of
visitors to the United Kingdom in that year was 819,000—more than twice the
1947 figure and two-thirds more than the number in 1937, the pre-war peak year.
In 1953 these visitors spent about £88 million, of which £31 million ($88 million)
was in dollar currency.
Changeover from State Trading to Private Trading
In the immediate post-war years nearly all the principal imported foods and raw
materials and some other goods were bought wholly or mainly on Government
account, and the Government was also the sole purchaser of nearly all domestically
produced food and certain raw materials such as flax and timber. By 1951 a con¬
siderable number of major commodities including wool, rubber, tin, wood pulp,
hardwoods, hides and skins, flax and leather, had been restored to private trade.
Since 1951 the changeover from state trading to private trading has proceeded
rapidly. Government monopoly oversea purchasing, which was responsible for
about half the United Kingdom’s total imports in 1951 (about two-thirds of food
imports and about one-quarter of raw materials) will by the end of 1954 be confined
to two foodstuffs—sugar and bacon—and one industrial commodity—jute goods.
These three items accounted for only about 6 per cent of total imports in 1953.
Concurrently with the process of reversion from public to private trading,
import licensing restrictions have been substantially eased, so that for most of the
principal foodstuffs and raw materials no limit is now imposed on the quantity
or value of imports from any country or, in some instances, from a wide range of
countries.
The principal quantitative controls still in operation on external trade are (1)
currency exchange control; and (2) import and export licensing.
Exchange Control
Exchange control, i.e. control over the purchase and sale of gold and foreign
currencies, was introduced at the outbreak of war in September 1939. The legal
basis was at first the Defence (Finance) Regulations issued under the Emergency
Powers (Defence) Acts, but in 1947 most of these temporary war-time powers were
embodied in permanent legislation in the Exchange Control Act, 1947.
Exchange control does not affect transactions wholly within the sterling area.
It is imposed only on: (a) transactions between residents within the sterling area
and residents outside; and (b) transactions conducted in sterling between persons
resident outside the sterling area. Although the main structure of exchange control
has continued intact since 1939, certain relaxations in its operation have been made
in recent years.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of the
administration is in practice carried out by the Bank of England as agent of the
Treasury—and in turn the Bank of England has delegated to the commercial banks
a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.

The chart given on p. 283 shows the main groups of sterling, the channels along
which it is allowed to flow and the degree of freedom permitted within the various
groups themselves. The arrows indicate the direction of transfers permitted without
requiring individual approval by the Exchange Control authorities, between the
different classes of sterling accounts; the number of such permitted transfers was
considerably increased by the extension of the Transferable Account Area in
March 1954. All other transfers require separate approval, which is usually given
if the transaction concerned is not likely to harm the United Kingdom or the
sterling area.
Foreign Exchange Market
From the beginning of the war until December 1951 the purchase and sale
(both spot and forward) of the more important foreign currencies by residents
of the United Kingdom for authorized transactions, was permitted only at official
buying and selling rates which were maintained at a narrow margin either side of
the parity of those currencies against sterling. From 17th December 1951 wider
spreads, between which spot exchange transactions could take place, were intro¬
duced and forward rates were entirely freed from restrictions, making it possible
to reopen the Foreign Exchange Market on a limited scale.
In May 1953 there was a resumption of arbitrage transactions (i.e. the purchase
of a currency in one market and its sale in another, taking advantage of a difference
in rates between the two markets) between London and the principal European
exchange markets in the more important European Payments Union currencies.
London Gold Market
The London Gold Market, which had also been closed since the beginning of
the war, was reopened on a restricted basis as from 22nd March 1954. The Market
operates under the general supervision of the Bank of England.
Dealings in the Market are conducted in sterling, but the reopening of the
Market does not make sterling more convertible into other currencies. Gold
transactions in the Market on account of non-residents are settled in sterling which
is the equivalent of dollars, i.e. payments are made into American, Canadian or
Registered Accounts1 all of which are exchangeable for dollars. Purchases of gold
for residents of the sterling area require prior permission of the Bank of England
and are strictly limited.
Import and Export Control
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, empowers the
Board of Trade to make Orders prohibiting or regulating the import or export of
goods. The most important of the current Orders made by virtue of this Act are
the Import of Goods (Control) Order, 1954, and the Export of Goods (Control)
(Consolidation) Order, 1954. Although the powers of both import and export
control derive from the same legislation, the purpose and mechanism are quite
distinct.
Import Controls
Although, under the Import of Goods (Control) Order, goods can be imported
into the United Kingdom only under licences issued by the Board of Trade, an
importer does not have to apply for a licence every time he wants to import
1 Registered Accounts may be opened by any non-resident (other than American or
Canadian). They may only be credited with the proceeds of sales of gold or dollars or with
transfers from American or Canadian Accounts.
TRADE
285
anything. A large number of goods can be imported under the Open General
Licence, which authorizes any person in the United Kingdom to import a
number of specified commodities without any limits of quantity or value, either
from anywhere in the world or from specified countries or groups of countries.
Similarly, for a wide range of goods, individual traders are granted Open Individual
Licences which allow them to import unlimited amounts of the goods from any
country or from specified countries or groups of countries. Nearly all the United
Kingdom’s imports from the sterling area, a very large part of its imports from
the rest of the non-dollar world, and a smaller, but still substantial, part of its
imports from the dollar area are admitted under Open General Licence or Open
Individual Licences.
When an importer wishes to bring in goods not covered by the unrestrictive
Open Licensing arrangements, the Board of Trade decides whether he should be
granted a licence to import a limited value of the goods in accordance with one of
three basic methods of determining who should be allowed to import goods and
in what quantities:
(1) ad hoc consideration of applications for licences;
(2) apportionment of quotas among importers;
(3) apportionment of quotas among exporters to the United Kingdom by
arrangement wdth the Governments of the exporting countries concerned.
The choice of method depends on the circumstances of the particular trade under
consideration.
Import and exchange control are closely linked. All holders of import licences
and anybody who wishes to import goods admissible under the Open General
Licence are granted the currency required to pay for their imports.
Export Controls
For the most part, United Kingdom exports are not subject to any Government
control or direction. Such controls as are in operation are imposed for the following
reasons:
(1) to control goods of strategic importance;
(2) to 'conserve or regulate the distribution of scarce materials,
(3) to assist exchange control operations in preventing exports of capital in
the form of valuable goods (e.g., diamonds);
(4) to control the re-export of materials purchased with dollars,
(5) to control the export of goods the prices of which have been subsidized
for consumption in the home market;
(6) to prevent the export of works of art, etc., of national importance.
The operation of export licensing control is such that goods are freely exportable
to all destinations unless there is a specific ban on their export without licence, as
detailed in the current Export of Goods (Control) Orders. Normally, individual
licences are required for specific consignments of goods subject to export licensing
control, but in a few cases Open General Licences are issued. In ot er ^a®es u
licences are issued to permit exports of specified quantities of controlled goods
within a given period. .
In recent years export controls have been greatly reduced and now cover only
a small proportion of total shipments. The position is continually under review
and relaxations in control are made whenever circumstances permit, hollowing
286
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
improvements in the supply position the majority of goods now subject to control
are of strategic importance. Certain of these strategic goods may be exported without
licence to the Commonwealth (other than Hong Kong), the Irish Republic and the
United States of America, but exports of such goods to other destinations are
subject to export licensing control. Since 1951 all exports to China and Hong Kong
have been subject to export licensing control.
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad cate¬
gories : trade in raw materials and intermediate products (such as steel plates) which
do not reach the hands of the public; and trade in consumer goods. An account of
the supply and distribution of consumer goods is given below.
Methods of distribution are varied and complex. On the basis of some pre-war
researches1, however, it would appear that 10 to 15 per cent of sales (by value) are
made to consumers through producers’ own selling organizations, including their
own retail shops, and in about half the rest the producers sell direct to retailers.
Where wholesale channels exist, they take a number of forms. Fish, for example,
is auctioned at ports mainly to port wholesalers to sell to inland wholesalers at
certain main distributive centres, who in turn sell to retailers, although a significant
number of retailers buy direct from port wholesalers. Most producers of fresh fruit
and vegetables (many of whom are small growers) market their products through
a wholesale market where most of it is handled by selling agents on a commission
basis. Wholesale distribution of consumer goods is not, however, generally
centralized.
WHOLESALE TRADE
The Board of Trade has published some preliminary figures of wholesale trading
in Great Britain, derived from the returns made by 55,472 wholesale establish¬
ments, in the Census of Distribution and Other Services 1950. These returns show
that 773,369 persons were engaged in wholesale trade, and that the wages bill,
excluding the incomes of proprietors, was £291 million. Table 48 summarizes
wholesale establishments by method of trading.
The greatest numbers of wholesale establishments are found in the clothing,
footwear and textiles trade (7,019), and the groceries, confectionery and drinks
trade (6,946).
RETAIL TRADE
Retail outlets of the United Kingdom can be classified into four types: {a) the
independent shop, (b) the departmental store, (c) the multiple shop and the variety
chain store, and (d) the co-operative society. There are as yet few self-service shops
in the United Kingdom, and street, market and yard traders (in coal and other yards),
though relatively numerous, are not believed to do a large volume of business.
Types of Shops
One-half of the retail trade of the United Kingdom is handled by independent
shopkeepers in ordinary small retail businesses consisting of a single shop or a few
shops.

pioneer unofficial studies, including The Distribution of Consumer Goods, by James B.
Jefferys, published in 1950.

i.e. including goods sold more than once at wholesale.

(d) Includes some selling establishments operated by manufacturers. Full information
about manufacturers’ distributive activities can be found only by using the Census of
Distribution Report in conjunction with the Census of Production Report for 1950.
(e) Kngaged in trades where firms undertake processing as w^ell as merchanting : e.g.,
fish curing, tea blending, coffee roasting and perfumery manufacture.
Such retailers usually serve customers in the immediate neighbourhood, often
supplying a great variety of commodities. Some specialist shops, however, have a
widespread and even an international clientele.
A departmental store is a shop having a number of departments for different
types of goods, while a multiple shop is a branch of a firm which owns or controls
a considerable number of similar retail outlets. Some shops are multiple depart¬
mental stores, i.e. they belong to a firm running several departmental stores.
Similar to these in their wide range of goods are the variety chain stores, which
are multiple shops of a special kind. Their main features are the sale of a wide
variety of goods under one roof, usually with low price limits, and the standardiza¬
tion of layout and general appearance.
Co-operative Societies
Retail co-operative societies are voluntary, non-profit-making associations
engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also their
customers. Any operating surplus is returned annually to members as a dividend.
Dividends are proportionate to the value of purchases made in the year and not
to investment in the society.
Retail co-operative societies sell to the general public as well as to their own
members, but membership is open to anyone willing to pay a small deposit on a
288
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
minimum share and entitles the member not only to a dividend but to an equal
voice with other members in deciding the society s policy. Investment of indi¬
vidual members is limited to £500 and the rules of some societies may fix lower
limits. Only a low fixed interest is paid.
Retail co-operative societies are free to buy where they will or produce their
own goods, but, in order to secure the advantages of large-scale production and
trade, they have collectively established wholesale and production societies.1
At the end of 1953 there were 1,101 retail co-operative societies registered under
the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, but nearly a quarter of the entiie
co-operative membership (over 11 million) was provided by the eight largest
societies, each of which had a membership of over 115,000. The total sales of the
retail societies in 1953 were £743 million, about 7 per cent of the total national
expenditure on consumer goods and services. Analysis of the 195° sales shows that
in particular categories of goods the proportion of co-operative to total national
sales is very much higher, e.g., about 17 per cent for food and over 8 per cent for
clothing.
The 1950 Census of Distribution
The reports of the Census of Distribution for 1950, published in 1953 and 1954,
gave details of retail trade and certain allied service trades in Great Britain in 1950.
The reports cover 684,764 establishments and 542,299 organizations (an organiza¬
tion is an undertaking operating one or more establishments) whose chief activity
is selling goods or providing certain services to the general public. Included in this
total are 531,143 retail establishments employing 2,265,291 persons (including
working proprietors and unpaid family workers) with a turnover of nearly £4,923
million and a wages bill of over £392 million. The other trades covered include
catering (turnover £277 million), hairdressing (£34 million), repairing for the
general public (£25! million), and the motor and cycle trades (£546 million).
Catering as part of the business of a hotel or public house is not included. Table 49
classifies establishments by kind of business, and shows figures for the main retail
and service trades. In addition there were over 3,500 central offices and warehouses
belonging to the larger organizations, employing 132,000 persons, with a wages bill
of £47 million. Owing to some non-response in the census these figures are not
complete, but the results for the retail trade, apart from the service trades, are
estimated to represent about 91 per cent of the total number of retail establishments
and about 95 per cent of the total turnover. ...
Forty-eight per cent of the retail trade was done by organizations consisting of a
single establishment. On the other hand 30 per cent was done by 534 large organiza¬
tions with annual sales of over £1 million.
The retail businesses are not all shops. The census found 531,143 retail (excluding
service and motor trade) establishments of which 467,700 were fixed shops, but
the total also includes 22,800 market traders, 6,600 street traders, 13,800 traders at
coal yards and other yards making retail sales, and smaller but still considerable
numbers selling by other methods. The retail shops included 483 self-service shops
with the high average turnover of £35>000‘> 47& °f these establishments are classified
in the grocery group.
The businesses of market traders, street traders and house-to-house sellers were
usually very small. The takings averaged between £1,000 and £2,000 a year and most
of these businesses only occupied one person full-time. The market and street
1 The two major wholesale societies are the Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited
and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited.
TRADE
289
traders in greengrocery and fruit had an average turnover of just over £2,000, and
nearly half the street traders included in the census were greengrocers and fruiterers.
It is not claimed that all street traders were included. The census gives no more
than a rough approximation of their numbers; but it shows that their businesses
were small, and that for instance in greengrocery and fruit, though street and market
traders and house-to-house sellers were numerous, they were responsible for only
a small proportion of the total sales.

CONTROLS ON CONSUMER GOODS
In recent years most of the controls on consumer goods surviving after the war
have been swept away. The last remnant of the war-time food rationing system—
the rationing of meat and bacon—was ended in July 1954- The dismantling of
rationing schemes has been accompanied, as a rule, by the removal of retail price
controls. The proportion of consumer outlays subject to price control diminished
from about 70 per cent in 1951 to about 40 per cent at the beginning of 1954; by the
end of the year it was a considerably lower proportion. The price of bread, milk
and potatoes continues to be controlled. In the case of bread and milk this is
because of the continuation of the consumer subsidy; in the case of potatoes it is
because of the existing fixed price and guarantee system (see p. 134).
The most important price control directly affecting the consumer and still in
force is that on rents (see p. 325).
Domestic Fuel
With certain exceptions,1 the supply of solid fuel for domestic use is restricted
under the Coal Distribution Order, 1943, by the imposition of maximum permitted
quantities’. These are not rations and provide no assurance that supplies will
be sufficient for everyone to purchase the maximum amount allowed. For the
purposes of control, solid fuel is usually divided into two groups : house coal and
boiler fuel (largely anthracite). It is usual, in defining the maximum permitted
quantities under each of these two headings, to give a total figure for the year from
May to April inclusive, and separate figures for the summer months, May to
October, and the winter months, November to April. Maximum permitted
quantities vary also between the northern and southern halves of the country, the
northern regions being allowed more coal than the southern regions.
Households which use solid fuel for cooking or have other special needs can
obtain fuel additional to the maximum permitted quantity on grant of a licence
from the local fuel office of the Ministry of Fuel and Power.
1 The following fuels are free from restriction: coke, wood, anthracite duff, washery
slurry, uncarbonized ovoids and briquettes, certain classes of coal not classified as house
coal’ because of unsuitable size or quality, and the carbonized smokeless fuels Coalite
and ‘Rexco’.
X. SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now directly responsible, through either central or local
government authorities, for a range of services covering subsistence for the needy,
education and health services for all, housing, employment or maintenance, the
care of the aged and the handicapped, and the nutrition of mothers and children,
besides sickness and industrial injury benefits, widow’s and retirement pensions
and family allowances. Public authorities in the United Kingdom are spending
over £2,000 million a year on social services; and Exchequer expenditure on social
services amounts to over a quarter of total central government expenditure.
Voluntary organizations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all
the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and
social and recreational clubs before these were provided by the State. They made
themselves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very old, the
homeless and the handicapped, before it was generally accepted that the whole
community had a responsibility towards these people. Where the services and the
facilities they provided were adequate, they have been encouraged to continue. The
State now supplements these voluntary services and provides financial assistance,
sees that essential services are brought within the reach of every citizen, and ensures
that the necessary standards are maintained.
Many voluntary social services still surround and supplement the State services.
The two types are not competitive but complementary and merge into each other.
The State services often work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to
serve individual or special needs. The welfare work of the National Assistance
Board is supplemented by the work of many voluntary social service societies
with whose workers the Board’s officers co-operate, while State institutional
provision for the chronic sick and aged is supplemented by voluntary homes
of various types for the care of the sick and elderly, most of whom receive State
pensions or benefit, or are directly maintained by public authorities.
Voluntary Bodies
The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain runs into
thousands. Some of them are large and some are small and local in character. Some
have general aims and others, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind,
have been established for a particular purpose. The societies co-operate with each
other and with local authorities engaged on the same work.
Foremost among societies providing general social service are the National
Council of Social Service, the Scottish Council of Social Service, and the Family
Welfare Association. The National Council of Social Service was established in
1919 to create a closer link between the machinery of government and the voluntary
activities of the ordinary citizen. The Family Welfare Association, formerly the
Charity Organization Society, founded in 1869, works on personal lines to help any
individual or family in need or difficulty. It has a number of District Committees in
London and, affiliated to it, about 60 family casework agencies in the provinces.
There is a Central Council for the Care of Cripples, and the major societies
caring for homeless children, such as Doctor Barnardo’s Homes and the Church of
England Children’s Society, are represented on the National Council of Associated
Children’s Homes. Other examples of co-ordination in a specialized field are the
National Association for Mental Health, the Women’s Group on Public Welfare
and the National Marriage Guidance Council.
291
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
292
Societies working on a national scale whose social work is definitely religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, the Social Service of the
Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children’s Society, the Church of
England Moral Welfare Council, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the
Young Women’s Christian Association, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the
Crusade of Rescue, the Jewish Board of Guardians and the Catholic Marriage
Advisory Council.
War-time organizations such as the Women s Voluntary Services and the
Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (there are still about 475 of these bureaux) continue, with
official support, to find scope for their activities. The Citizens Advice Bureaux act
as interpreters between the Government Departments and the ordinary citizen, and
though the inquiries are somewhat fewer now than during the war more skill and
time are often needed for their solution. WVS activities are many and various. They
include welfare work for children, the aged and the sick, and for certain foreign
workers, as well as relief work in emergencies.
The old-established British Red Cross Society not only aids the sick and wounded
in time of war but works in peace time for ‘the improvement of health, the preven¬
tion of disease, and the mitigation of suffering’. It is, in particular, developing its
welfare services for civilian disabled, invalid and crippled children and the aged.
The members of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and, in Scotland, the St.
Andrew’s Ambulance Association likewise render voluntary auxiliary medical
services and undertake welfare work for the sick and the infirm.
Old People's Welf are
Voluntary bodies also take a large share in the work for old people that has been
steadily expanding since the war brought into prominence the problems of old
people’s welfare that social and population changes had already begun to accentuate.
Hostels for bombed-out or evacuated old people have been followed by perma¬
nent homes where old people can live together in happiness and comfort however
small their means. Voluntary homes of this kind now number over 700. More than
2,500 social clubs for elderly people have been started in recent years in all parts of
Britain. The regular visiting of lonely old people and the delivery of cooked meals
to their homes (‘meals-on-wheels’) are other welfare services that are being
developed by voluntary effort with State support with the object of enabling old
people to continue to live in their own homes wherever possible.
Local Old People’s Welfare Committees are formed by those concerned in this
work, and are aided by the National Old People’s Welfare Committee, an associ¬
ated group of the National Council of Social Service widely representative of
voluntary and statutory bodies having direct contact with old people, or by the
Scottish Old People’s Welfare Committee, a committee of the Scottish Council of
Social Service. A National Corporation for the Care of Old People was established
in 1947 by the Nuffield Foundation (see p. 339) and the Lord Mayor’s Air Raid
Distress Fund to stimulate and to give financial support to schemes for the welfare
of the aged, to establish and demand desirable standards for old people’s homes,
to maintain an expert technical advisory service, and to encourage and to undertake
research and experiment for the welfare of old people. The Corporation is now
concentrating its main effort on home services for old people. About £500,000
from the King George VI Memorial Fund is to be spent by the King George VI
Foundation on schemes for the benefit of old people.
The Social Worker
While the voluntary worker giving full- or part-time service has done pioneer
work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an essential part in
SOCIAL WELFARE
293
probably every service, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their
operation primarily on the professional social worker, that is the full-time salaried
worker trained in the principles and technique of social service. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university diploma or certificate course in
social science followed by a specialized training for a particular service. The latter is
usually organized by the profession concerned. An attempt is being made to lessen
specialization in social work.
Voluntary organizations have been pioneers in the employment and training of
social workers, but it is a significant fact that central Government Departments and
local authorities are employing trained social workers in greater numbers and in
more services. Such workers include regional and local welfare officers, children’s
care organizers, children’s officers for work under the Children Act, 1948, neigh¬
bourhood workers, youth leaders, almoners, mental health workers, psychiatric
social workers, tuberculosis care workers, housing managers, personnel managers
and probation officers; in fact, representatives of most branches of social work.
NATIONAL INSURANCE AND RELATED SERVICES
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and
National Assistance together constitute a system of social security in the United
Kingdom which ensures that in no circumstances need anyone fall below a minimum
standard of life. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance administers the
first three of these measures in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland they are adminis¬
tered by the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance. National Assistance is
administered by the National Assistance Board in Great Britain, and in Northern
Ireland by the National Assistance Board of Northern Ireland. Pensions and
welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants (see p. 299) are the
responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance throughout
the United Kingdom.
The Poor Relief Act of 1601 can be regarded as the starting-point of public
provision for social security in England and Wales. From the beginning of the
present century, and particularly after the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws
and Relief of Distress had issued its report, with the influential Minority Report,
in 1909, a strong movement arose against the form and spirit of the poor law as it had
been administered under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. The first depar¬
ture from the poor law as the sole means of relief given from public funds had been
the introduction in 1908 of non-contributory old age pensions granted on a test of
means. The poor law was finally superseded by the National Assistance Act, 1948.
In the same period there was a development of compulsory insurance administered
on a national basis. In 1912 came the National Health Insurance scheme and with
it the introduction of the contributory principle on which all later measures have
been based. In return for a small weekly contribution it provided a small cash
payment and medical treatment without charge during sickness. It applied only to
a limited number of the lower-paid workers. In 1912 also a limited scheme of
unemployment insurance was started. This was extended in 1920 to cover the great
majority of employed persons, a very necessary provision in view of the large-scale
unemployment of the inter-war years. In 1926 contributory pensions for old people,
widows and orphans were introduced.
By the beginning of the second world war the social services in Britain were
among the best in the world, but they lacked co-ordination by the very fact of their
piecemeal development, and they were not universal. A comprehensive, co-ordi¬
nated and unified plan for social security was needed.
294
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the stimulus of war, when plans for post-war reconstruction were being
formulated. Lord (then Sir William) Beveridge was invited by the National Govern¬
ment to investigate the country’s existing social insurance system. In 1942 the
Beveridge Report was published and recommended the creation of a comprehensive
and unified system of social insurance. The report aroused intense interest and was
accepted in general by the Government as the basis on which the future social
security structure should be built.
In the immediate post-war years a series of Acts introduced a new comprehensive
system which became fully operative on 5th July 1948. Adjustments have been
made in a number of subsequent Acts.
Reciprocity
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a single
system. Reciprocal agreements on family allowances are in operation with Guernsey
and New Zealand. An agreement with Australia to cover sickness and unemploy¬
ment benefits, widow’s and retirement pensions and family allowances came into
force in January 1954. An agreement with the Republic of Ireland covers sickness,
unemployment and maternity benefits and the insurance of seamen. There are also
agreements covering various aspects of social security operating with France (since
November 1949), with Italy (since June 1953)* with Switzerland (since June i954)>
and with Jersey (since July and August 1954). while an agreement with Luxembourg
was signed in October 1953 and will come into operation after it has been ratified.
An agreement with Denmark on industrial injuries insurance came into force in
May 1954. Similar agreements with other Commonwealth and European countries
are under negotiation.
A multilateral agreement on social security, signed by the five Brussels Treaty
Powers, was ratified by the United Kingdom in May 1950, and was implemented
a year later for limited purposes. It will come into full operation when the complete
network of bilateral agreements between the five participating countries has been
completed.
FAMILY ALLOWANCES
The Family Allowances scheme was the first part of the new system to be intro¬
duced. It started on 6th August 1946 and provided initially an allowance of 5s. a
week for every child in the family after the first under the age limit, i.e. up to the
end of compulsory school age (normally 15) and for any further period before the
1st August following the sixteenth birthday while the child is receiving full-time
instruction in a school (or would still be receiving such instruction but for ill health),
or is an apprentice. The rate was raised to 8s. a week in September 1952, under
the Family Allowances and National Insurance Act, 1952. Family allowances are
paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit the family as a whole;
these allowances are paid to the mother.
At the beginning of 1954 nearly five million family allowances were being paid
to nearly three and a quarter million families in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland
over 100,000 families were receiving between them more than 210,000 allowances.
NATIONAL INSURANCE
The National Insurance Act, 1946, came into full operation on the 5th July 1948.
It has been amended by the National Insurance Acts, 1949 and i95I> the Family
Allowances and National Insurance Act, 1952, and the National Insurance Acts,
SOCIAL WELFARE
295
1953 and 1954. The Acts apply, in general, to everyone over school-leaving age
living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in Northern Ireland and the
Isle of Man.
Contributors are divided into three classes:
Class 1—Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a contract of
service or are paid apprentices—about 21 i million.
Class 2—Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account and others
who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an employer—
about 1 £ million.
Class 3—Non-employed persons. All insured persons who are not in Class 1 or 2—
about half a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by regulations,
to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in their own house¬
hold duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’ insurance and cannot
become insured in their own right unless they were insured under the old scheme
on the 5th July 1948 and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons,
or have since taken up paid work. Students undergoing full-time education and
unpaid apprentices need not pay contributions. Up to the age of 18, contributions
are credited to them. Over that age they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed
persons (Class 3). Self-employed and non-employed persons whose income is not
more than £104 a year can apply for exception from liability to pay contributions
under the scheme.
Contributions
The main weekly rates of contribution from June 1955 are shown in Table 50.
* Includes Industrial Injuries Insurance contributions.
These contributions, which the Exchequer supplements from general taxation,
are normally paid on a single contribution card by National Insurance stamps
bought from a post office. It is the employer’s responsibility in the first place to see
that the Class 1 contributions are paid, but he can deduct the employee s share from
his or her wages. The self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own
cards. Contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or
injury, or if widow’s benefit is being paid.
U
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
296
Benefits
The scheme provides sickness, unemployment, maternity and widow’s benefit,
guardian’s allowance, retirement pension and death grant. Industrial injuries
benefits (see p. 298) are paid under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)
Acts, 1946 to 1953 as amended by the National Insurance Act, 1954.
Persons in Class 1 are covered for all benefits; those in Class 2 for benefits other
than unemployment and industrial injuries benefits; and those in Class 3 for benefits
other than sickness, unemployment and industrial injuries benefits, and maternity
allowance.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before any
benefit can be paid, a minimum number of contributions must actually have been
paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit cannot be paid
unless a certain number of contributions have been paid or credited over a specified
period. For guardian’s allowance and industrial injuries benefits there are no
contribution conditions.
The rates quoted below are those which will be paid from April or May 1955.
Sickness Benefit
The standard weekly rate of sickness benefit for a man or woman over 18
(except a married woman) is 40s., with an increase of 25s. for an adult dependant
and ns. 6d. a week for the first or only child under the age limits (see p. 294), with
3s. 6d., in addition to any family allowance payable, for each subsequent child.
The weekly rate for a married woman is 25s., but she is paid at the 40s. rate if
she is maintaining an invalid husband or is separated from her husband and cannot
get financial support from him.
Unless 156 Class 1 or Class 2 contributions have been paid since the last entry
into insurance, sickness benefit can be drawn only for a year, but in general it
continues for as long as sickness lasts, once 156 contributions have been paid.
Unemployment Benefit
The rates of unemployment benefit are the same as for sickness benefit except
that the standard rate for insured married women is 30s. instead of 25s.
Unemployment benefit is paid in the first place for 180 working days, but it may
be continued for up to a maximum of 19 months in all if the insured person has a good
record of contributions paid as against unemployment benefit drawn in recent years.
Maternity Benefit
The National Insurance Acts, 1953, and 1954, amended the maternity benefits
of the 1946 Act. A maternity grant of £10 is payable for all confinements, and
where more than one child is born at any confinement additional grants may be
payable. A home confinement grant of £4 is payable where the mother is not con¬
fined in free accommodation under the National Health Service or in accommoda¬
tion otherwise paid for out of public funds. A maternity allowance of 40s. a
week, beginning with the eleventh week before the expected week of confinement,
payable for 18 weeks, is available for working women who satisfy the contribution
conditions. These are that during the year ending 13 weeks before the expected
week of her confinement, the claimant must have paid 26 contributions as an
employed or self-employed person and, for the full rate of the allowance, have a
total of at least 50 contributions paid or credited. The maternity allowance provided
under the 1946 Act of 36s. weekly for 13 weeks is retained for a limited transitional
period by the 1953 Act; for this allowance, a married woman need not have paid
contributions, although she must show that she is ordinarily at work.
SOCIAL WELFARE
2Q7
Widow's Benefit
There are three kinds of widow’s benefit, paid only on the deceased husband’s
insurance. A Widow’s Allowance of 55s. a week plus ns. 6d. a week for the
first or only child under the age limits (see p. 294) and 3s. 6d. a week for second
and subsequent children (in addition to family allowances) is paid for 13 weeks. A
Widowed Mother’s Allowance of 51s. 6d. a week is paid following widow’s allow¬
ance to a widow who has a child within the meaning of the Family Allowances Act
(see p. 294); she also receives 3s. 6d. a week, in addition to any family allowance, for
each child after the first. A Widow’s Pension of 40s. a week is paid to a widow
(a) who is 50 or over at the time of the husband’s death and has been married ten
years, or (b) who is 40 or over when her widowed mother’s allowance ends, provided
ten years have elapsed since the marriage, or (c) who, when her widow’s allowance
or widowed mother’s allowance ends, is incapable of self-support because of
infirmity and is likely to remain so for a long time.
Guardian's Allowance
A Guardian’s Allowance of 18s. a week may be paid to a person having care of a
child whose parents (or step-parents) have died and one of whom was insured under
the National Insurance Act. This continues while the child remains in the guardian’s
family and is a child within the meaning of the Family Allowances Act.
Retirement Pension
Retirement pensions are paid to men at the age of 65, and to women at the age of
60, provided they have retired from regular employment. From the age of 70 (men)
and 65 (women), however, the pension is payable whether or not the claimant has
retired. The standard rate is 40s. a week. A married woman ordinarily qualifies
for pension on her husband’s insurance at the standard rate of 25s. a week. If
after retirement a pensioner below the age of 70 (65 for a woman) earns any money,
then, for every is. earned over £2 a week, is. is deducted from the pension.
Men and women are encouraged not to retire at minimum pension age and are
able to earn a larger retirement pension by continuing in their jobs. For every six
months they stay at work between the ages of 65 and 70 (men) or 60 and 65 (women)
their pension is increased by is. 6d. a week. The pension of the wife of such a
contributor is increased by is. a week for each six months’ extra work and continues
at this rate up to the time of the contributor’s death; if his wife survives him
her pension is re-calculated at the is. 6d. rate. A man now reaching the age of
65 who continues at work for a further five years can therefore receive a pension of
as much as 55s. on attaining the age of 70. If he has a wife not more than five
years younger than himself, their combined pensions can be 90s.; if the wife sur¬
vives her husband her pension can be 55s.
A retirement pensioner is entitled to an increase of 25s. a week for his wife
if she is under 60 and also to an increase of 1 is. 6d. for the first child under school¬
leaving age and 3s. 6d. for each succeeding child, in addition to any family allow¬
ance payable.
Death Grant
A Death Grant of up to £20 is paid towards the expenses in connection with the
death of an adult, and a smaller sum on the death of a child. Grants are not paid
for persons already over pension age on 5th July 1948, or for children born before
5th July 1948 if they die before they are ten years old. Reduced grants are paid on
the deaths of people who on 5th July 1948 were over 55 (men) or over 50 (women).

NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES)
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which replaced the Workmen’s
Compensation scheme in July 1948, provides benefits for personal injuries caused
by accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed
diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone in Class 1
of the National Insurance scheme and certain others.
Benefits
Injury Benefit
Injury Benefit for an adult is 67s. 6d. a week plus 25s. for an adult dependant
and 1 is. 6d. for the first or only child under school-leaving age and 3s. 6d. for each
other eligible child, in addition to any family allowance payable. It is paid when the
insured person is incapable of work as a result of an industrial accident or disease,
and payment can continue for a maximum of 26 weeks from the date of the accident
or development of the prescribed disease.
Disablement Benefit
Disablement Benefit may be paid when injury benefit stops and the amount
depends on the extent of the disablement, as assessed by a medical board. It varies
from 67s. 6d. for 100 per cent disablement to 13s. 6d. a week for 20 per cent
disablement. For disablement of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is paid, ranging up
to £225.
In the following circumstances Disablement Benefit may be increased:
1. It will be made up to the 100 per cent rate during in-patient treatment in a
hospital for the relevant injury or disease, and increases for dependants will
be paid.
2. If benefit is being received at the 100 per cent rate and someone is needed to
look after the insured person, a constant attendance allowance not exceeding
30s. a week (60s. in certain cases) may be paid.
3. If the insured person is permanently unfit for work an unemployability
supplement of 40s. a week may be paid, with allowances for dependants.
4. If the insured person is unfit to return to his former job, or work of a similar
standard, benefit may be increased (subject to a maximum of 67s. 6d.)
by a special hardship allowance of up to 27s. 6d. a week.
Death Benefit
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, Death Benefit is
paid to the dependants. The amount varies according to the degree of relationship
and the extent of maintenance during lifetime.
A widow receives a pension of 55s- a week for the first 13 weeks. Thereafter
she gets a pension of 45s. a week if she is over 50 or permanently incapable of self-
support or has the care of a child of the dead man. In other cases the pension is 20s.
a week. In addition, an allowance of 1 is. 6d. can be paid for the first or only child,
and 3s. fid. for each other child under school-leaving age.
Certain other dependants, such as parents, are entitled to pensions, allowances or
gratuities. The amounts vary with the closeness of the relationship and the extent
to which they were maintained by the deceased during his lifetime.
Adjudication
Claims to benefit under the National Insurance and National Insurance (Indus¬
trial Injuries) Acts are decided by independent statutory authorities appointed
under the Acts.

2Q9
NATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND CARE OF CHILDREN
The National Assistance Act, 1948, also came into operation on 5th July 1948. It
provides a unified State service of financial assistance for those in need, replacing
the various ‘needs’ services provided in the past by the State and local authorities.
As the residual service, National Assistance meets the financial needs of all those
people who are unable to maintain themselves and who fall outside the scope of the
other social security services, and supplements the insurance benefits when they
are insufficient.
The National Assistance Board is responsible for administering these weekly
cash grants. It has various other duties, including the administration of non¬
contributory pensions under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1936; the administration of
hostels provided under the Polish Resettlement Act, 1947, for Poles in Britain who
are not yet absorbed into the normal life of the community; and the assessment
under the Legal Aid and Advice Act, 1949, and Legal Aid and Solicitors (Scotland)
Act, 1949, of the disposable income and disposable capital of persons seeking aid
under the Acts.1
The Board is responsible for influencing ‘persons without a settled way of living’
(formerly known as ‘casuals’) to lead a more settled life. It provides temporary
accommodation for such persons, usually through the agency of local authorities,
and it runs a residential re-establishment centre for men of this type or men who
have been long unemployed and in receipt of National Assistance grants.
The provision under the National Assistance Act of residential accommodation
for the aged, infirm and others, and of special welfare services for the blind, the
deaf, the crippled and other handicapped persons is not the responsibility of the
National Assistance Board but of county and county borough councils and, in
Scotland, of councils of large burghs.
The Children Act, 1948, provides that all local authorities shall have special
children’s committees to be responsible for the care of all children deprived of a
normal home life, and in other ways makes improved provision for their care.
In Northern Ireland financial assistance is given under the provisions of the
National Assistance Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, to persons in need and there is
also a system of non-contributory pensions similar to that in operation in Great
Britain. Under the Welfare Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1949, local authorities,
in their capacity as welfare authorities, provide residential accommodation for the
aged, infirm and other persons who are in need of care and attention. The welfare
authorities also provide special services for the blind, deaf and other handicapped
persons and are responsible under the Children’s Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, for
the care of all children deprived of normal home life.
WAR PENSIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Pensions to persons disabled or bereaved through the wars are paid under Royal
Warrants. Rates are to be raised in February 1955.
The basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier will be
67s. 6d. a week but the amount varies according to the rank and the degree of
disablement. Supplementary allowances for dependants, unemployability, constant
attendance, additional comforts and reduction of earning power are also paid. The
degree of disability is assessed by comparing the disabled person with a normal
healthy person of the same age and sex, without taking earning capacity into
account.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary payments are free of

300
income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any allowance payable
under the Family Allowances Act.
War pensioners have priority (except over more urgent cases) for treatment of
their war disabilities in National Health Service hospitals.
The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance maintains a welfare service for
war pensioners, with a special branch for war orphans.
The British Legion and other voluntary associations also give financial aid and
personal service to disabled ex-servicemen and women and their families. The
Ministry and these bodies work in co-operation.
The Imperial War Graves Commission
The Commission was founded in 1917, its purpose being to commemorate the
war dead of the British Commonwealth and Empire by establishing war cemeteries,
ensuring the perpetual care of war graves, whether in these cemeteries or elsewhere,
and erecting suitable memorials to those who have no known grave. A Charter of
1940 extended the Commission’s powers to enable them to deal with the dead of
the 1939-45 war. The members of the Commission include representatives of the
United Kingdom and Commonwealth Governments and of the three Services, and
a number of unofficial members chosen for distinction in various walks of life. The
cost of the Commission’s work is borne by the respective Governments in propor¬
tion to the numbers of the graves of their dead.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with public health is chiefly a development of the last
100 years. The second half of the nineteenth century saw the growth of compulsory
and comprehensive environmental health services, such as provision of pure water,
sewerage, disposal of refuse, cleaning of streets, building byelaws and other
measures designed to promote healthy living conditions in Britain. Local authori¬
ties provided smallpox and other infectious-disease hospitals and poor law infirm¬
aries in the nineteenth century, but the main hospital and medical services remained
in the hands of voluntary hospitals and private practitioners until the twentieth
century. The main development of publicly provided personal health services, as
distinct from environmental services, took place in the twentieth century. The
medical benefit introduced under the National Insurance Act of 1911 was the first
step in the provision of a State-aided general practitioner service outside the poor
law. There was progressive development in the hospital services provided by local
authorities, and the period before the first world war is notable for the development
of maternity and child welfare and of measures for the prevention and treatment
of tuberculosis.
Since the first world war there has been progress in many directions: medical
research, discovery of important new drugs, blood transfusion, control and treat¬
ment of venereal disease, and research into diet.
The second world war served to emphasize the importance of a sound diet and as
a result the Welfare Foods Service for expectant mothers was introduced (see
pp. 306-7) and the School Meals Service (see p. 313) and industrial canteens were
expanded. War also stimulated developments in industrial health services (see
pp. 244-5) and in the rehabilitation of the disabled (see pp. 234-5 and 304).
THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service was established in 1948. The relevant Acts, the
National Health Service Act, 1946, the National Health (Scotland) Act, 1947, and
SOCIAL WELFARE
301
the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948, came into force simultaneously
on 5th July 1948.
The National Health Service Act, 1946, aims ‘to promote the establishment in
England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improve¬
ment in the physical and mental health of the people of England and Wales and the
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness, and for that purpose to provide or
secure the effective provision of services’. The National Health Service (Amend¬
ment) Act, 1949, the National Health Service Act, 1951, and the National Health
Service Act, 1952, make some modifications in the scheme for Great Britain and
provide for charges to be made for certain parts of the Service, which is otherwise
free of charge, and which is available to all according to medical need. Its avail¬
ability is not dependent on contribution to National Insurance.
Health Service Administration in Great Britain
In England and Wales the Minister of Health has assumed direct responsibility
for (1) the provision on a national basis of all hospital and specialist services, (2) the
former mental health functions of the Board of Control and local authorities, except
for the quasi-judicial functions of the Board designed to safeguard the liberty of
the patient,1 (3) the conduct of research work into any matters relating to the
prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness or mental defect, (4) a public health
laboratory service, and (5) a blood transfusion service. He has indirect responsi¬
bility for the establishment and maintenance of general practitioner services and all
other services. He is advised by the Central Health Services Council and by stand¬
ing advisory committees on various aspects of the Service.
The hospital and specialist services are administered through Regional Hospital
Boards and Hospital Management Committees or, in the case of teaching hospitals,
by Boards of Governors. The hospitals themselves have been grouped into adminis¬
trative units; these consist sometimes of several formerly independent hospitals,
and sometimes of one. There are nearly 400 such groups under the control of
hospital management committees, which are in turn under the control of 14 regional
hospital boards. The regions are arranged so that the hospital and specialist services
can conveniently be associated with a university having a school of medicine.
The members of the hospital management committees are appointed by the
regional hospital board. The committees, by their constitution, reflect the com¬
munities concerned, for they usually include not only medical practitioners but
members of local authorities, trade unionists and others. The regional hospital
boards are appointed by the Minister and are similarly constituted. The term of
office is three years, one-third of the board or committee retiring each year but
being eligible for reappointment. The boards of governors of teaching hospitals are
appointed by the Minister, a proportion of the members being nominated by the
teaching faculty of the university, the regional hospital board and the medical staff.
1 The functions of the Minister include the supervision of local authorities in the per¬
formance of their duties with regard to persons of unsound mind (see p. 308), the general
supervision of matters relating to mental defectives, and the licensing or other formal
approval of accommodation for mentally ill or defective patients outside the National
Health Service. The Board of Control deals with the admission, discharge and periodical
review of mentally disordered or defective patients and inspects all institutions for their
care, whether in or outside the National Health Service.
In October 1953 it was announced that a Royal Commission would be set up to inquire
into the existing law and administrative machinery governing the certification and care,
other than hospital care or treatment under the National Health Service Acts, of persons
suffering from mental illness or defect.
ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES
302
SOCIAL WELFARE
3°3
All appointments to hospital management committees, regional hospital boards and
boards of governors are honorary.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister. It is the
Minister’s responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medical
students. The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The administration of the General Medical Services (see p. 305) is in the hands
of 138 Executive Councils, each covering the area of a county or county borough.
(In a few cases two areas are combined under one council.) Each council has an
Ophthalmic Services Committee responsible for administering the Supplementary
Ophthalmic Service. Councils of counties and county boroughs are the 146 local
health authorities in charge of local health services (see pp. 305-8).
In Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland is the responsible Minister; 31
county councils and 24 town councils of large burghs are the local health authori¬
ties; hospital and specialist services are administered by five Regional Hospital
Boards appointed by the Secretary of State, assisted by 85 Boards of Management
(the equivalent of hospital management committees in England); and there are 25
Executive Councils, each serving the area of one or more local health authorities.
The Scottish Health Services Council and its Standing Advisory Committees advise
the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch with the Central Health Services
Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Service is described separately on pages 308-9.
Health Service Finance
About four-fifths of the cost of the National Health Service falls on the Exchequer.
The balance is met by a transfer from the National Insurance Fund, staff super¬
annuation contributions, payments by persons using the Service and local rates.
(Half the expenditure by local health authorities is refunded to them by the central
Health Departments.)
Since 1950 an attempt has been made to check the rising expenditure on the
National Health Service and to keep the net total cost to the Exchequer for the
Service in Great Britain from greatly exceeding £400 million. To help to limit
expenditure without reducing the services offered, it was found necessary in 1951
and again in 1952 to introduce charges for certain items in the Service. There is
a charge of is. on each prescription form, and charges are also made for dentures
and spectacles (except children’s spectacles in standard frames), for elastic hosiery
supplied in the family doctor service or hospital out-patients department, for
certain appliances supplied to out-patients, for treatment (not examination only)
in the Dental Service, and for the use of local health authority day nurseries. Certain
exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the National Assistance
Board for help in meeting any of these charges. Under the 1946 Act a certain
number of beds may be put aside for hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided
that this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Charges for these ‘amenity’ beds are fixed under Regulations. Provision is also made
at certain hospitals for patients who wish to occupy private patients’ accommodation
on payment of the whole cost of this accommodation and treatment. Such patients
may make private arrangements for treatment by a doctor of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried or part-time; part-time
medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept private
patients.
General medical practitioners in public service are remunerated mainly by
capitation fees according to the number of persons on their lists. In some circum¬
stances doctors may receive an Initial Practice Allowance which is limited to a
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
304
three-year period and to a maximum of £600 in the first year, £45° in the second,
and £200 in the third. There is a right of appeal if the Executive Council refuses its
consent.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed scale
of fees according to the items of treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists dis¬
pensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
dispense. Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the Supplementary
Ophthalmic Service are paid on the basis of the number of sight tests made;
opticians who dispense glasses are paid according to the number of pairs of glasses
supplied.
Hospital and Specialist Services
The hospital and specialist services include the provision of consultants ; hospitals
of all kinds including maternity accommodation, tuberculosis sanatoria, mental
hospitals and institutions for the mentally defective, infectious-disease units,
convalescent homes and rehabilitation centres; and all forms of specialized treat¬
ment.
At the end of 1953 there were in the Service in England and Wales 2,688 hospitals
(including teaching hospitals) with 478,367 available beds and a nursing and mid¬
wifery staff of 144,558 full-time and 28,704 part-time nurses. In Scotland there
were 412 hospitals with 64,905 beds. A small number of hospitals remain outside
the Service for special reasons. Most of these are run by religious orders.
Teaching Hospitals
There are in all about 140 hospitals in Great Britain with medical teaching
facilities. The 26 London teaching hospitals are in fact groups of hospitals, and
include 65 hospitals and 30 convalescent homes, branches, annexes or treatment
centres. The 10 teaching hospitals in Wales or in the provinces cover 55 hospitals
and 12 other establishments. The teaching hospitals in Scotland come under the
control of the Regional Hospital Boards, but special Medical Education Committees
consider matters relating to medical teaching.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation departments are established at the main hospital centres. The
work is carried out under the guidance of the appropriate medical specialist by
physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists and social workers,
working as a team. The aim is to prevent undue disability and to restore fitness after
all forms of sickness and injury. Experience has shown that efficient medical
rehabilitation reduces the stay in hospital, the incidence of permanent disability
and the period of incapacity for full work. The departments work in close associa¬
tion with the Disablement Resettlement Service of the Ministry of Labour and
National Service (see pp. 234-5). Rehabilitation methods have been applied with
advantage in the care of the chronic sick and have enabled many patients to be dis¬
charged from hospital and to resume an independent life in their own homes.
Blood Transfusion
The National Blood Transfusion Service is administered by the regional hospital
boards under the National Health Service. Each of the regions is centred pn a
university town, where an organization is maintained for collecting blood within
the region. The blood is kept in the Regional Blood Bank, or issued to Area Blood
Banks which are maintained at general hospitals in each county. Each of the
principal hospitals holds a supply of blood sufficient not only for its own needs but
SOCIAL WELFARE
305
also for the smaller hospitals, nursing homes and general practitioners in its district.
In Scotland, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association organizes the
service on behalf of the Secretary of State. The blood is provided free by voluntary
donors recruited from the public. In 1953 the total of blood donations was 660,000.
Medico-Social Work
There are about 1,000 trained almoners working in Britain; the majority work in
hospitals, others in local health authority services or elsewhere. The almoner
co-operates with the medical staff in the investigation and treatment of disease by
elucidating and adjusting social and economic factors which contribute to a
patient’s disability or impede his restoration to health. Psychiatric social workers
are specially trained for work in the mental health and education services. They are
an invaluable complement to doctors not only in mental and mental deficiency
hospitals but also in the local health and educational services, in assessing the
environmental factors in mental abnormalities and in helping to adjust patients
to their environment, or to change the circumstances of their lives.
The General Medical Services
The General Practitioner Services cover the medical attention given to individuals
by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those enrolled in the
Service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own surgeries; in a few places
they practise in health centres established under the National Health Service Acts.
Over 20,000 general medical practitioners (principals and assistants) out of a
total of about 21,000 in England and Wales, and over 2,400, or almost all, general
practitioners in Scotland, are in the Service.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the Service at its start in the
place where they were practising. Those now wishing to start practice have to
apply through their Executive Councils to the central Medical Practices Committee,
so that a better distribution of doctors throughout the country may be facilitated.
The maximum number of patients’ names permitted to be on one principal’s list
has been reduced from 4,000 to 3,500. The average number in England and Wales
is about 2,400.
Of about 10,000 dentists in England and Wales available for general practice,
about 9,500 are in the Service, and of about 1,250 dentists in Scotland practically
all are in the Scottish Service.
Nearly 1,000 ophthalmic medical practitioners and just over 7,000 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales and 72 ophthalmic medical practi¬
tioners and 933 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland are engaged in the
Supplementary Ophthalmic Service. This service provides for the testing of sight
and provision of glasses. Cases requiring treatment are dealt with through the
hospital eye service.
Almost all chemists (15,000 in England and Wales and 1,750 in Scotland) are
taking part in the Service.
Local Health Services
The Local Health Services administered by the county and county borough
councils (in Scotland, county and large burgh councils) include those for maternity
and child welfare (but not hospitals and maternity homes), domiciliary midwifery,
vaccination and immunization, health visiting, home nursing, the prevention of
illness and the care and after-care of the sick (including the mentally ill and also the
mentally defective), the provision of domestic help in time of sickness or confine¬
ment, etc., the ambulance service (in Scotland, the responsibility of the Secretary
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
306
of State), and the establishment and maintenance of local health centres (in Scot¬
land, the responsibility of the Secretary of State).
Welfare Centres
Maternity and child welfare centres have been established for many years. In
England and Wales there are about 5,000 child welfare, 1,800 ante-natal and 270
post-natal clinics. In Scotland there are 400 child welfare, 90 ante-natal and 80
post-natal clinics. These are part of the advisory and preventive services of the local
health authority and they provide regular supervision by nurses and doctors for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. Special clinics for test feeding
and for remedial exercises may also be arranged at a number of centres and a feature
of the service is the education of the mothers by means of talks, demonstrations and
special classes, particularly in mothercraft. Some centres are also the distribution
points for the national dried milk and vitamin preparations provided for expectant
mothers and young children which are now being distributed by local health
authorities (see p. 307). In England and Wales more than three out of four babies
attend the centres.
Maternal Care
According to the advice given by the doctor or midwife and her own preference,
the expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital; in
allocating hospital beds priority is given to those for whom domiciliary confine¬
ment is inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home
conditions. For a home confinement every mother has available to her the services
of either a general practitioner obstetrician or her own family doctor if he is willing
to undertake her maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife employed in
the domiciliary service of the local health authority. The doctor carries out certain
ante-natal and post-natal examinations, attends at the confinement (if he thinks it
necessary) and gives any other medical care required. Routine supervision and
advice is provided by the midwife, who visits regularly before the confinement
for the purpose of examination and to give the mother advice and help generally.
In addition, the expectant mother may attend the ante-natal clinic for instruction
in the preparation for motherhood and in some cases for interim ante-natal super¬
vision. The midwife delivers the patient (unless the doctor considers it necessary
to be present) and continues in attendance for the first 14 days after the birth.
Midwives work in close touch with the welfare centres in the care of the mother
both before and after the birth of the child.
Vaccination and Immunization
Arrangements are made with doctors for a service providing free vaccination
against smallpox, and immunization against diphtheria. Parents cannot be com¬
pelled to make use of this service but they are given every encouragement to do so;
and the success of the diphtheria immunization campaign is a very hopeful sign.
In 1953 there were only 23 deaths from diphtheria in England and Wales as against
2,641 in 1941; in Scotland, only 2 deaths as against 517 in 1941.
Welfare Foods Service
Local health authorities distribute the welfare foods other than liquid milk that
the Welfare Foods Service1 provides for expectant and nursing mothers and young
1 The Service began in 1940 with the National Milk Scheme and in 1946 the extended
scheme was put on a permanent basis as the Welfare Foods Service. Beneficiaries now

children, at a low cost or free of charge. These foods are National Dried Milk as an
alternative to liquid milk1 and at an equivalent price; orange juice, at 5d. a six-fluid-
ounce bottle, and cod liver oil, free of charge, for expectant mothers and children
under five; vitamin A and D tablets, free of charge for expectant mothers as an
alternative to cod liver oil, and also for mothers for 30 weeks after confinement.
Milk and orange juice are supplied free to expectant mothers and to children under
school age if the families cannot afford to pay.
Other Maternity and Child Welfare Services
Many local health authorities make special arrangements for premature babies
remaining in their own homes, by lending equipment and appointing experienced
nursing staff to supervise their care.
There are some day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain provided
by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with them. The
National Health Service Act, i952> gave local authorities power to make charges
for the use of day nurseries. Private or factory nurseries must be registered with the
local health authorities; this regulation applies also to persons who mind for pay¬
ment more than two children, not all of the same family.
Local authorities co-operate with voluntary denominational and other bodies
caring for unmarried mothers and their babies, or make direct provision for their
special needs through welfare workers, homes, hostels and nurseries, and by finding
suitable foster-mothers.
Health Visiting
Health visitors, who are qualified nurses with special additional training, give
expert advice to mothers in their own homes on such matters as breast feeding, the
general care of the baby, and the nurture of children up to five years old. They are
also responsible for giving advice on the care of the sick and the measures necessary
to prevent the spread of infection.
Home Nursing
The employment of nurses for attending persons who require nursing in their
own homes is the responsibility of the local health authorities. Although many
authorities employ nurses directly for this purpose, others have entered into
arrangements with voluntary organizations to provide a service on their behalf.
Domestic Help
Local health authorities have the power to make arrangements for providing
domestic help in households where it is needed owing to illness, confinement, or
the presence of children, old people or mental defectives. This is not one of the
free services and authorities are authorized to recover from those assisted such
charges as the authorities consider reasonable having regard to the person’s means.
Ambulance Services
Free conveyance between home and hospital or clinic is provided where neces¬
sary either directly by local health authorities or by arrangement with voluntary
organizations. The Hospital Car Service (organized by the British Red Cross
Society, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, and the Women’s Voluntary Services)
1 The liquid milk allowance (which is obtained through usual retail channels) is one
pint a day at 1 £d. a pint for expectant mothers, children under five, and children between
five and sixteen who are physically or mentally disabled and are unable to attend school
where they would receive milk.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
308
provides transport in many areas for patients who do not require an ambulance;
such patients are conveyed in private cars whose owners volunteer to give this
service, and the authorities make a mileage payment to the volunteers to cover their
expenses. In Scotland, ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance Service (St.
Andrew’s Ambulance Association and the Scottish Branch of the British Red Cross
Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State.
Mental Health Services
Persons of unsound mind who are in need of care and treatment which cannot
be provided in their homes may be admitted to mental hospitals as voluntary,
temporary or certified patients. If such persons, or their relatives, are unable or
unwilling to make the necessary arrangements for admission to a mental hospital,
it is the duty of a duly authorized officer of the local health authority to do so.
Local health authorities have a duty to ascertain mental defectives in the com¬
munity, to supervise them and to provide suitable training or occupation. This is
given in occupation centres where the defectives attend daily, as at school,
or by home teaching. If supervision affords insufficient protection it is the duty of
officers of the local health authority to take the initial steps to place such defectives
under guardianship within the community or to arrange for their admission to a
mental deficiency hospital.
Control of Infectious Disease
Control of infectious disease is based on four main principles: notification,
isolation, supervision of contacts, and immunization. The investigation of out¬
breaks of infectious disease is the concern of local Medical Officers of Health and
of the Public Health Laboratory Service associated with the Medical Research
Council (see pp. 345-6).
There are arrangements to deal with certain conditions and diseases which
require specialized treatment both to alleviate the sufferings of the patients and to
protect the community as a whole, such as the provision of treatment centres for
venereal disease and the provision of sanatoria and chest clinics for the specialist
treatment of tuberculosis. The prevention of tuberculosis, and of infectious
diseases generally, is also a matter of active concern. The public is offered free
examination by mass miniature radiography for the early detection of chest disease,
at the end of 1953, about 70 mass radiography units were operating in England and
Wales.
Health Centres
Local health authorities are also responsible for the provision of health centres
buildings in which facilities may be made available for all or any of the main health
services, other than hospital beds. A few health centres have already been estab¬
lished, but scarcity of resources has prevented the building of centres on a large
scale and also it is generally felt that experience should be gained from the use of a
few experimental centres before any general provision of them is attempted. In
Scotland the provision of health centres is the direct responsibility of the Secretary
of State for Scotland.
HEALTH SERVICES IN NORTHERN IRELAND
In Northern Ireland the historical development of the health services has taken
broadly the same course as in other parts of the United Kingdom and the Health
Service established under the Health Services Act (Northern Ireland), 1948,
corresponds fairly closely to the medical care system established under the National
SOCIAL WELFARE
3°9
Health Service in Great Britain. The essential principle is that the same range of
services shall be available to citizens in Northern Ireland as in England, Wales and
Scotland. The Service in Northern Ireland is financed as in the rest of the United
Kingdom.
In hospital administration the role of the central Government is not quite so
immediate or direct as in Great Britain, and hospital property, for example, is vested
not in the Minister but in a public board, the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
The Hospitals Authority has under its control 63 hospitals with about 14,000 beds.
The Tuberculosis Service is on a separate footing from the main Hospital
Service, having been established a little earlier to deal urgently with a serious
tuberculosis problem. The Northern Ireland Tuberculosis Authority, which was
constituted for the prevention of tuberculosis and the care of tuberculous patients
by the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act (Northern Ireland), 1946, has eight
hospitals under its control.
Vaccination against smallpox is compulsory in Northern Ireland but otherwise
the range of preventive and domiciliary services is similar to that existing in Great
Britain.
THE MEDICAL, DENTAL AND AUXILIARY PROFESSIONS
Only persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from medical practitioners, only persons
whose names are on the dentists’ register can prafctise dentistry in Britain. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, plus one year as an intern; for a dentist, four
or more years at a dental school are required.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration as a
general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick children’s,
mental, and mental deficiency nursing. The enrolled assistant nurse undergoes an
essentially practical training for one year, followed by a year’s work under super¬
vision before enrolment.
Only registered pharmacists may describe themselves as such, and qualifications
requiring four to five years’ vocational training are necessary for registration.
For the professions of almoner, chiropodist, dietitian, medical laboratory
technician, occupational therapist, psychiatric social worker, physiotherapist,
radiographer and speech therapist a good general education is required followed by
a professional training. The length and nature of the training varies according to
the profession.
VOLUNTARY AID FOR THE SICK AND HANDICAPPED
A number of voluntary organizations provide services of various kinds for sick
and handicapped persons in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the services
provided by central and local authorities. A number of convalescent homes, for
instance, of a type outside the scope of the hospital service are administered by such
bodies. In many areas invalid children and others needing care in their own homes
are visited and helped by voluntary organizations. Special organizations also serve
the welfare of the blind, the deaf and other special classes. Though the need for
material aid from private sources becomes less as public provision extends, many
special forms of help to meet individual needs that would not otherwise be met are
given by voluntary agencies. Their most valuable service is probably to provide
personal service and the continued personal interest that can contribute so much
to the welfare of the sick and infirm. These voluntary agencies usually depend
largely on the work, part-time or full-time, of unpaid volunteers.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
EDUCATION
There are over seven million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools or universities in the United Kingdom. Over 90 per cent of school
children attend publicly provided or aided schools. The universities are indepen¬
dent, self-governing institutions but they derive an increasing proportion (now
over two-thirds) of their funds from public sources. Many schools and colleges
continue to benefit from the endowments provided by benefactors in past centuries.
In England and Wales, the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning of
the present century. In 1833 Government had begun to make annual grants to
the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the Elementary Educa¬
tion Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory education. By the end of the
nineteenth century elementary education had become virtually both compulsory
and free. Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales) started
in England under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public
education in England and Wales. It seeks to widen and improve educational oppor¬
tunities at every stage.
The Scottish and Irish educational systems have each a long history independent
of that of education in England, but the same general policy is now being imple¬
mented throughout the United Kingdom, with some national variations in Scot¬
land, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Educational Administration
The national system provides education in three stages : primary, secondary, and
(for those who have left school) further education. Local authorities are responsible
for ensuring that adequate facilities are available in their areas throughout these
stages.
The relation of the central authority (the Ministry of Education in England and
Wales, the Scottish Education Department, and the Ministry of Education for
Northern Ireland) to local education authorities is based on consultation and
co-operation by direct contact with the IVIinister and the Department and through
Her Majesty’s Inspectors who act as liaison officers. All schools, including indepen¬
dent schools, are subject to official inspection.
SCHOOLS
School attendance is compulsory between the ages of 5 and !5 *n Great Britain
(temporarily 14 in Northern Ireland). In England and Wales over 6,270,000
children, including about 173,000 under and 222,000 over compulsory school age,
are attending publicly maintained schools, besides 99,000 others (including 1,500
under and 27,000 over school age) who are at schools receiving direct grants from
the Ministry of Education. There are also about half a million children of all ages
at independent schools. In Scotland, 833>300 children are attending publicly main¬
tained or aided schools and about 21,000 are at independent schools. In Northern
Ireland, 248,000 children (including 16,000 under and 18,000 over compulsory
school age) are attending publicly maintained or aided schools; independent schools
are few.
In England it is usual for boys and girls to be taught together in primary schools,
but more often than not they attend separate secondary schools. Mixed schools are
more common in Wales; and in Scotland all but a few city schools take both boys
and girls. In Northern Ireland there are a number of separate schools for boys and

311
girls, especially among schools under voluntary management, except for the
smallest primary schools.
The majority of independent schools are for boys or for girls only, except
in classes for small children. There are, however, a few schools which are
co-educational.
In England and Wales the State provides money for three broad types of school:
county schools which are provided and maintained by local education authorities,
i.e. their full cost falls on public funds; voluntary schools which have been
provided by a voluntary body (usually of a religious denomination) but which are
maintained by local education authorities; and direct grant schools which are
completely independent of local education authorities but receive a grant-in-aid
from the Ministry of Education.
In Scotland the schools provided by education authorities are called public
schools, but in England this term is used for a different type of school (see below),
of which there are also a few in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.
In Northern Ireland there are county schools, managed by local education
authorities, and voluntary schools, which are grant-aided schools under voluntary
management.
Primary Schools
A child’s primary education continues until about the age of 11 in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland and 12 in Scotland. There are some nursery schools
and classes for children between 2 and 5 years old. In England and Wales there are
infant schools, or departments, for all children between 5 and 7 and junior schools
for those aged 7 to 11. In Scotland there are primary departments for children
between 5 and 12 years old.
Secondary Schools
England, Wales, and Northern Ireland
Public provision of secondary education is being greatly extended with the aim
of providing for all children an education suited to their particular abilities. The
grammar school takes children who hope to reach a university and others with an
academic bias. Most grammar schools are now either maintained or aided from
public funds although many are of ancient foundation. Secondary modern schools
(intermediate schools in Northern Ireland) are the largest group and give a more
general education with a practical bias, closely related to the interests and environ¬
ment of their pupils; the secondary technical schools (technical intermediate schools
in Northern Ireland) are the smallest group and offer an education largely related
to one or other of the main branches of industry, including commerce, or agri¬
culture. These different types of education may be provided in separate schools or
combined in one school. Some authorities are experimenting with the large compre¬
hensive school providing all types of secondary education.
Most grammar school pupils remain until they are 16 years old, some till they
are 17, 18 or 19. Most secondary modern school pupils at present leave at the
age of 15.
Public Schools. The public school is a characteristic English institution which has
made a notable contribution to English education. Many public schools date from
the sixteenth century, some are older (e.g., Winchester, 1382, and Eton, 1440). The
public school is controlled by its Board of Governors, although it may nowadays
receive aid from public funds, usually by way of direct grant from the Ministry of
Education. Public schools have emphasized the importance of character-building,
X
312
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and in these schools were developed the prefect system, whereby day-to-day
discipline is largely controlled by the pupils themselves, and the house system,
whereby a school is divided into groups of about 50 each under the care of a house¬
master. A public school is often, although not necessarily, a boarding school. The
usual age of entry for boys is 13 and the leaving age about 18. There are some girls’
public schools modelled to a certain extent on the public schools for boys.
General Certificate of Education. The examination system for secondary schools
in England and Wales was revised in 1951 when an examination, conducted at three
levels, for a General Certificate of Education replaced the former School Certificate
and Higher School Certificate examinations. Candidates from both State-aided and
independent schools may take the examination, which is also open to candidates not
attending any school. Most candidates are at least 16 years old on 1st September of
the year of their examination, but a child can sit at an earlier age at the discretion
of the head master or mistress of the school. In the summer of 1953 some 19,000
children under the age of 16 took the examination. In Northern Ireland the Junior
Certificate Examination is taken at about the age of 15 and the Senior Certificate
Examination, which is conducted at two levels, at about 17.
Scotland
Scottish secondary schools fall into two main categories, those providing courses
extending normally to three years, generally called junior secondary schools, and
those providing courses of five or six years, known as senior secondary schools. In
each type of school the courses are intended to provide a general education, but
they are differentiated in character to suit the varying needs and abilities of the
pupils, and include literary, commercial, boys’ technical, domestic and rural courses.
While some schools are purely junior secondary and some purely senior secondary,
there are also a number of schools of the ‘comprehensive’ type in which all kinds of
courses, both junior secondary and senior secondary, are provided. Many schools
also provide modified courses for pupils of limited ability for whom the normal
courses are too exacting.
The courses, extending to five or six years, normally provided in senior secondary
schools lead to presentation for the Scottish Leaving Certificate which is awarded
and issued by the Scottish Education Department.
Private Schools
Private schools are independent schools owned by individuals or groups of
individuals. They comprise a variety of day and boarding schools, but are usually
comparatively small. Some provide both primary and secondary education, others
take only pupils of a certain age group. Private schools include most of the
preparatory schools, usually boarding schools, for boys aged about 8 to 13 who are
intending to enter public schools.
Broadcasting and Visual Aids
The School Broadcasting Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation
sends out over 50 transmissions a week which reach more than 25,000 schools in
the United Kingdom, over 60 per cent of the possible total. School broadcasting
does not attempt to cover the whole school curriculum, or to replace the teacher,
but to supplement existing methods of teaching.
Visual aids to education—films, film strips, wall charts, pictures, and models—
are being increasingly used in Britain’s schools.
SOCIAL WELFARE
313
Religion in Schools
All children in county or voluntary schools, that is, all schools wholly or partly
financed by local authorities, receive religious instruction and take part in a daily
corporate act of worship unless their parents object. In the voluntary school there
is opportunity for denominational religious instruction and in the county school
religious instruction of an undenominational Christian character is given. Over a
third of the schools maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales
are voluntary schools and the majority of these are Church of England primary
schools. There are nearly 2,000 Roman Catholic voluntary schools and smaller
numbers belonging to other religious bodies. In county schools in Northern Ireland
clergy have a right of access to give denominational instruction to children of their
persuasion for a limited period each week. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the
individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruction are in the hands of
the school managers, but there are a number of denominational schools conducted
by education authorities.
Services in the school chapel and religious teaching are an essential part of the
life and education of the independent public schools and most of these schools are
linked to some religious denomination.
Health and Welfare of School Children
Special educational treatment, either in special schools or otherwise, is provided
for children between the ages of 5 (or less) and 16 who require it on account of any
physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment. There are over 700 special
schools in the United Kingdom, including hospital schools, day and boarding
schools, and boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
The School Health Service provides regular medical examination and certain
free treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local education
authorities. Treatment provision includes dental clinics and child guidance centres.
(There are also child guidance clinics in the National Health Service.) In Northern
Ireland the School Health Service is operated by the health authorities as part of
the National Health Service.
Milk (one-third of a pint a day in Great Britain and two-thirds in Northern
Ireland) is given free to all children in schools who wish to have it, and the School
Meals Service provides a daily dinner at a subsidized price (remitted where there
is need) to nearly half the pupils in county and voluntary schools. Free transport is
provided for children attending these schools who live more than a reasonable
walking distance from their schools (two miles for those under eight years and
three miles for those over eight years).
Teachers
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing bodies
or managers. They are not subject to official control on questions relating to
curricula or methods.
In 1953 there was one full-time teacher to 27 pupils in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in England and Wales; the figure was 24'5 f°r
Scotland and 30 for Northern Ireland. The high birth rate at the end of the second
world war is the chief of several factors in the present need for more teachers.
There are some 153 teachers’ training colleges in England and Wales giving a
training usually lasting two years to students aged 18 or over, and 23 university
departments of education providing a one-year course for graduates. In Scotland
there are four general training centres, two denominational training colleges and a
college for women teachers of physical education. Courses are normally of one
3H
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
year’s duration for graduates or the equivalent, and of three years for non-graduates.
Northern Ireland has two general teacher training colleges, one university training
department and three specialist colleges—one for training teachers of physical
education, one for teachers of domestic science and one for teachers of art. The
basic course in the general training colleges lasts three years.
The Education Departments, the universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short courses for practising teachers. Teachers
from schools in the United Kingdom go to a number of oversea countries each year
under interchange schemes or schemes for temporary oversea posts.
UNIVERSITIES
In 1953 there were some 82,000 full-time students at universities or university
colleges in the United Kingdom. In Great Britain in October 1953 the number was
79,600; in 1938-39 it had been about 50,000, and increased from under 38,000 to
over 85,000 in the first five years after the war. Nearly three out of four students
are now being aided from public funds or from scholastic endowments (see p. 316).
The Education Departments have no jurisdiction over the universities, and their
relations with them are concerned mainly with the training of school teachers, the
provision of adult education, and the award of scholarships from public funds. The
universities, though self-governing institutions, receive aid from the State in the
form of direct grants from the Treasury made on the advice of the University
Grants Committee, a committee appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer from
persons with experience of university administration and education.
There are 15 degree-giving, self-governing universities in England and Wales:
Oxford, Cambridge, London, Birmingham, Bristol, Durham, Hull, Leeds, Liver¬
pool, Manchester, Nottingham, Reading, Sheffield, Southampton and Wales; and
3 university colleges of lesser status. Oxford and Cambridge Universities, each
with a number of colleges, are very old foundations and are residential. Most of the
other universities, three of which—London, Durham and Wales—also comprise
groups of largely autonomous colleges, are mainly non-residential. The tutorial
system of individual tuition to supplement the lecture system is a traditional and
valued feature of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and is now being developed
in the other universities and colleges of Britain.
There are four Scottish universities, all dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth
centuries: St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Northern Ireland has
the Queen’s University of Belfast and the Magee University College, Londonderry
(associated with the Universities of Dublin, in the Irish Republic, and of Belfast).
Degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though in medicine
five or six years are required. All the universities provide for post-graduate work
and research. Courses in arts and science, pure and applied, are offered by all
universities. Further reference to technology in the universities is made below.
FURTHER EDUCATION
Outside the universities there is a great variety of further education, full-time and
part-time, for men and women, and for boys and girls who have left school. Local
education authorities are required to secure such provision, either directly or by
aiding voluntary bodies and institutions. Vocational and non-vocational courses at
all levels and in all subjects are available in technical, commercial and art colleges,1
in evening institutes and in adult education classes. Increasing numbers of young

information on art colleges see p. 359.
SOCIAL WELFARE
315
persons are being released by their employers during working hours for part-time
education, both vocational and general.
Evening classes for adults, in addition to the extra-mural courses provided by
the universities, are organized by local education authorities and also by voluntary
bodies, notably the Workers Educational Association, and are aided by Government
grants. There are six grant-aided residential colleges which provide one-year non-
vocational courses for adult students, and since the end of the war more than
20 residential colleges have been established where adult students can take short
courses lasting from a few days to a few weeks.
Technical and Technological Education
Technical education is related closely to the needs of the individual industry
and of the individual student. In the technical colleges most of the students are
taking part-time national courses while serving an industrial apprenticeship. A
steady programme of development in technical education is being carried out.
Higher technical or technological education is provided, in close co-operation
with industry, in both the universities and the technical colleges of Britain. There
has been a great expansion of facilities for technological education since the second
world war, and the Government is promoting a further expansion by increased
grants for selected technical colleges and courses and the planned expansion
of institutions of university rank in London (see p. 340), Glasgow, Manchester,
Leeds and Birmingham and for developments in other centres.
FINANCE
The bulk of expenditure on education in the United Kingdom comes from
public funds: of this public expenditure about 60 per cent comes from taxes and
about 40 per cent from local rates. It is estimated for 1954-55 that total public
expenditure on education, which is increasing, will be about £471 million for Great
Britain. This includes expenditure on university education. Northern Ireland
Exchequer expenditure on education is estimated at about £7^ million for 1954-55.
The proportion of university income provided by the Exchequer is increasing
and in 1952-53 was over two-thirds for Great Britain. Another 4 per cent was
contributed by local authorities, 13 per cent by fees, and the balance by endow¬
ments and other sources.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending schools
maintained by local education authorities, and books and equipment are supplied
free. Local education authorities pay for free places in direct-grant schoo.s and, to
a lesser extent, for free and assisted places in independent schools which lormally
charge fees. A number of schools are able to offer some scholarships from endow¬
ments. In Scotland, education authorities may charge fees in certain schools
provided that this does not prejudice the provision of free education for all who
desire it. In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending
any county or voluntary primary, intermediate or special school and qualified
pupils attending both county and voluntary grammar schools receive scholarships
from the local education authorities which cover the whole or most of the fees
charged by the school.
Grants and Scholarships
England and Wales
Grammar schools receiving grants direct from the Ministry of Education still
charge fees but they are required to offer each year, to pupils who have at any time
previously attended a grant-aided primary school for not less than two years, free
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
316
places to the extent of not less than 25 per cent of the previous year’s admission to
the upper school, and a further 25 per cent must be placed at the disposal of the
local education authorities if they require them. Pupils occupying these latter places
need not previously have attended a grant-aided primary school.
Day pupils not holding free places are entitled to claim a remission of fees in
accordance with an approved income scale, and the Ministry pays the governors of
the school the amount of the fees so remitted.
Over the past five years the number of scholarships and awards for university
students has been greatly increased with the aim of ensuring that no able candidate
shall be debarred from a university education for lack of means. Some 2,800 State
scholarships for university honours degree courses were taken up by young students
in 1953 besides 120 technical State scholarships and 25 mature scholarships for
students over 25 years of age from adult education classes. In 1953 local education
authorities in England and Wales awarded nearly 10,000 university scholarships
with maintenance grants. Numerous exhibitions and scholarships are also awarded
from endowments by universities and colleges and private benefactions. The
Ministry supplements university open scholarships and exhibitions as may be
necessary.
Scotland
In Scotland the power of awarding bursaries and scholarships is confined in the
main to the education authorities, who in exercising this power are required to
comply with regulations made by the Secretary of State. There are no State
scholarships, but the Secretary of State supplements scholarships at English
universities won in open competition by Scottish students.
Northern Ireland
University scholarships in Northern Ireland are awarded either by the local
education authorities or from endowment funds. The Ministry of Education awards
State exhibitions. Supplementary awards are made by the local education authori¬
ties and not, as in England and Wales, by the Ministry.
Educational Building
The requirements of the Education Acts, war damage, population movements
and the higher birth rate have combined to call forth an exceptionally large pro¬
gramme of educational building. In England and Wales the value of all such work
begun b tween 1945 and the end of May 1954 amounted to approximately
£284 million. This included some £194 million for major projects on primary and
secondary schools and about £23 million worth of major building for further
education; the number of schools completed was 2,004 (1,636 primary and 368
secondary schools). In Scotland, work to the value of £40 million was approved
between 1945 and the end of 1953, during which period about 3,750 rooms were
built.
The Exchequer grant-in-aid for universities in Great Britain for the year
1954-55 included £6-2 million for capital developments.
In Northern Ireland, capital investment in school building rose from £500,000
in 1949 to £3 million in 1953 and is expected to increase to £4 million in 1955.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The object of the Youth Service in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people and to offer them opportunities—complementary to
those of home, formal education and work—for discovering and developing their
SOCIAL WELFARE
317
personal resources of body and spirit, so that they may be better equipped to be
responsible members of a free and civilized society. There is no regimentation of
young people; they are free to join any of the youth organizations, or none, and the
facilities for recreation, educational pursuits and social contacts offered are suffi¬
ciently varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl.
Responsibility for the Youth Service is shared by the Education Departments,
local education authorities and numerous voluntary organizations. There is no
attempt to impose a system of uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a
national youth movement. The voluntary organizations, though strengthened finan¬
cially by State support, retain their independence of action. The practice of demo¬
cratic self-government has an established place in most youth organizations and
service to the community is encouraged. The major voluntary youth organiza¬
tions have memberships totalling over two million young people under 21 years
of age.
Youth groups have been developed mainly by voluntary organizations. The
oldest of these were formed during the nineteenth century and most of them,
for example, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian
Association, the Boys' Brigade and the Church Lads' Brigade, were religious in origin
and purpose. Later organizations, such as the Boy Scouts' and Girl Guides'
Associations, which, as movements, have no definite affiliation with a religious body
although local groups are often attached to a church or chapel, also recognize the
importance of spiritual values in the formation of character and seek to inculcate
high ideals of personal conduct and of service to others.
Local education authorities have been indirectly concerned in the Youth Service
since 1918, and in 1939 the then Board of Education decided to take direct responsi¬
bility for youth welfare. The Board urged local education authorities to stimulate
the provision of leisure activities for young people, both by co-operating with
voluntary agencies and by establishing Youth Centres and other recreational facili¬
ties of their own.
The status of the Youth Service as an essential part of the educational system,
thus recognized in 1939, was confirmed by the Education Act of 1944 and the
Education (Scotland) Act of 1945 and, today, all local education authorities are
required to ensure that adequate facilities for the recreational and social needs of
young people exist in their areas. In areas where voluntary youth organizations are
well established, local education authorities are expected to co-operate with them,
and where existing services are inadequate, to make provision themselves (usually
in the form of Youth Centres which offer varied activities to large groups of young
people). Most local education authorities now employ full-time paid youth
organizers and have appointed local youth committees or councils, on which official
and voluntary bodies are represented.
Over twenty voluntary organizations, each with at least 10,000 members between
the ages of 14 and 20, belong to the Standing Conference of National Voluntary
Youth Organizations.1 There are also the youth organizations of the political parties.
In addition, there are a number of bodies which, though not specifically youth
organizations, cater for the welfare of young people by providing them with oppor¬
tunities for physical training, holidays, camping and travel. Local authorities
provide playgrounds and playing-fields in public parks and gardens.
1 The Standing Conference of National Voluntary Youth Organizations was founded in
1936 as a consultative body which takes action only in the name of its constituent members
and with their consent. Its member organizations have a common aim in the development
of character through educational and recreational interests, and the promotion of the
physical, mental and spiritual training of their members.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
3l8
Finance is provided by voluntary subscriptions from members and others, by
money-raising efforts by members, by grants from the great charitable trusts, by
contributions from local authorities’ rates, and by direct grants from the Education
Departments. It is estimated that in the year 1954-55 the Education Departments
will give £275,000 in direct grants to voluntary youth organizations in England,
Wales, and Scotland, while local education authorities will probably spend several
times this amount on the Youth Service. The Ministry of Education for Northern
Ireland estimates that its expenditure on youth work in 1954-55 wiN exceed
£93,000 and local education authorities expect to spend more than £31,000. About
£1 million from the King George VI Memorial Fund is to b$ spent by the King
George VI Foundation on schemes for the benefit of young people.
Some Youth Organizations
The following examples are selected to illustrate the variety and wide scope of
the services and activities provided by voluntary organizations in Britain concerned
with the welfare of young people in their leisure hours. Other groups include the
Catholic Young Men’s Society, the Methodist Association of Youth Clubs, the
Co-operative Youth Movement and the Welsh League of Youth.
Scouts and Guides
The Boy Scouts' Association and the Girl Guides' Association, which were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 respectively, are based on the principle of
the development of character and good citizenship in boys and girls by training
them in habits of observation, self-reliance, self-discipline, loyalty and thoughtful¬
ness for others, and by promoting physical fitness and a knowledge of useful crafts.
Both associations have world-wide affiliations, and are undenominational and non¬
political in character.
In 1954 there were 229,000 Boy Scouts (aged n to 18 years) and Rovers (18 to
25 years) in the United Kingdom. This total includes Sea Scouts and Air Scouts.
There were also 220,000 Wolf Cubs (aged 8 to 11 years).
At the end of 1953 there were 225,000 Girl Guides in the United Kingdom,
including Sea and Air Guides, and also Cadets and Rangers (aged 16 to 21 years).
There were also 204,000 Brownies (aged 7 to 11 years).
The Boys' Brigade
The Boys’ Brigade, which was founded in 1883, is essentially a Protestant religious
organization. Every company must be affiliated to a church, and regular attendance
at church is a vital principle. Companies have regular drill parades, there are club
rooms for games and other pastimes, and organized camping during the summer
months is a feature of the movement.
The Church Lads' Brigade
The Church Lads’ Brigade, which is a similar organization, is attached to the
Anglican Church. Companies are formed in parishes under the direct control of the
incumbent.
National Associations of Clubs
The National Association of Boys' Clubs and the National Association of Mixed
Clubs and Girls' Clubs, which are non-sectarian, provide educative recreational
facilities for young people designed to develop their mental, physical and spiritual
well-being. Discussion groups, handicrafts, drama, music and many other activities
are encouraged.
SOCIAL WELFARE
319
Pre-Service Organizations
Pre-Service organizations, which comprise the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet
Force Association and the Air Training Corps (see pp. 98, 101 and 103), have special
connections with the respective Service Departments and receive financial grants
from them. The training of boys for entry into the armed forces, provided by these
organizations, is linked with training to promote their social, educational and
physical development. Similarly the Girls' Training Corps, the Girls' Nautical
Training Corps and the Women's Junior Air Corps prepare girls for entry into the
Women’s Services.
Young Farmers' Clubs
The National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs (see pp. 145-6) instructs its
members in agricultural subjects and rural crafts, and each club has the support of
an advisory committee on which local farmers are represented.
Outward Bound Trust
The Outward Bound Trust, which maintains a mountain school at Eskdale, in
Cumberland, and sea schools at Aberdovey, in North Wales, and at Burghead,
Morayshire, in Scotland, provides four-week character-building courses for boys
from all walks of life but mainly for young employees in industrial firms sent at their
employers’ expense. The boys live as a community and are given the opportunity
to assess and develop their qualities of courage, endurance, initiative and self-
discipline in learning the techniques of sailing or of rock-climbing, by various
physical tests, and in expeditions over rough hill country lasting several days.
Similar, but modified, courses for girls are held from time to time, chiefly at Bisham
Abbey, in Berkshire.
Youth Hostels
The Youth Hostels Association, which was founded in 1930, seeks to promote a
greater knowledge of, and love for, the countryside. It caters for young people of
limited means by providing hostels where they can stay for one or two shillings a
night when on walking or cycling tours or canoe trips. The movement has a
membership of over 200,000 and maintains 300 hostels in England and Wales.
There is a membership in Scotland of some 31,300 with 24 hostels, and of about
5,000 in Northern Ireland where there are 23 hostels. The Association is linked
closely with similar organizations in other countries and, through its International
Travel Bureau, encourages and facilitates the exchange of visits.
Political Party Youth Groups
Youth groups which are junior branches of the political parties in the United
Kingdom are maintained by each of the leading parties to spread party doctrine
among young people, and to obtain party recruits. Members are encouraged to
form debating societies and to engage in other social activities, and they are trained
to take an active part in party politics.
Youth Sections
Youth Sections are maintained by several other adult voluntary organizations
which have a particular function; for example, the British Red Cross Society and
the St. John Ambulance Brigade train their young members in first aid and home¬
nursing.

The Central Council of Physical Recreation
The Central Council of Physical Recreation, on which the leading voluntary
youth organizations are represented, is grant-aided by the Ministry of Education
and by the corresponding Department in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1935
to improve the physical and mental health of the community through physical
recreation. The Central Council arranges training courses, provides instructors in
games and athletics, plans and judges athletic competitions and organizes demon¬
strations of sport and physical training. It also arranges training holidays for young
people in its three National Recreation Centres. The corresponding body in
Scotland is the Scottish Council of Physical Recreation.
The National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association is another central organization which
provides amenities for the Youth Service. It was founded in 1925 to secure adequate
playing fields and playgrounds for young people, either directly or in co-operation
with local authorities and youth organizations.
XI. HOUSING AND
PLANNING
PROBLEMS AND ADMINISTRATION
The problems of housing and of planning the use of land in Britain have their
origins mainly in the sevenfold expansion of the population in the last two and a
half centuries and its concentration in industrial urban areas (see pp. 6 and n).
This gave rise to overcrowding in the older houses in the centres of cities and to the
unplanned spread of outer suburbs. Overcrowding persisted in spite of a high rate
of building in the nineteen-thirties and was aggravated by the second world war
which left behind increased needs and new opportunities for housing and planning.
New building had virtually ceased for six years, while the United Kingdom popula¬
tion had risen by nearly i £ million; meanwhile, approximately one house in every
three had been destroyed or damaged by enemy action.1
Ministerial Responsibility for Housing and Planning
The Minister of Housing and Local Government is responsible in England and
Wales for formulating housing policy, for housing standards and for general
supervision of the housing programme. In planning, the Minister is responsible for
implementing general policy regarding the use and development of land throughout
England and Wales, and for the direction and guidance of local planning authori¬
ties, the New Towns Development Corporations and the National Parks Commis¬
sion in the carrying out of their planning functions.
In Scotland local housing and planning authorities are supervised by the
Department of Health.
In Northern Ireland the Minister of Health and Local Government is responsible
for housing and planning.
The Ministry of Works acts as production authority in Great Britain for certain
building materials and equipment ; it is responsible for general building efficiency
and for relations with the building industry, and it is primarily responsible for keep¬
ing building research under review (see p. 351). The Ministry of Labour and
National Service is concerned with the supply of labour to the building industry
and its ancillary trades; and the Building Apprenticeship and Training Council
reviews the industry’s long-term labour needs and the measures necessary to main¬
tain the skilled labour force. The Agricultural Departments are responsible for
advising on the agricultural value of land proposed for housing or other develop¬
ment. The Board of Trade is responsible for regulating the distribution of industrial
development (see p. 117). An Inter-Departmental Committee on Services’ Land
Requirements meets to harmonize Service and civilian needs and proposals for
land use.
HOUSING
The 1 per cent sample of the 1951 Census of Great Britain showed the number of
occupied structurally separate dwellings in Great Britain as 13,312,000, the number
of private households as 14,481,000 (of which 2,079,000 were in shared dwellings),
1 In 1941 a scheme of payment for damage by enemy action to land and buildings in the
United Kingdom was set up, and the War Damage Commission was appointed to
administer it.
321

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and the excess of households over dwellings as 1,169,000 (see p. 14). The average
number of persons per room was 0-76.
HOUSING POLICY AND PROGRESS
Since 1945, when Britain’s post-war housing drive began, it has been the consis¬
tent policy of the Government to use the share of the national resources that could
be made available for housing to provide the greatest possible number of houses of
a good standard and to ensure that they went to those families most in need of
them. To achieve this object, control has been exercised over the use of resources,
and priority over other less urgent forms of building has been given to housing,
together with schools and with factories for Development Areas. Private building
was controlled by a system of licensing until November 1954. The amount of
building by local authorities themselves, who have been responsible for the greater
part of the post-war housing programme, has been carefully controlled. In the
course of following this general policy there have been changes in methods and
emphasis in accordance with changes in the availability of resources.
The Conservative Government which came into office in October 1951 decided
that the house-building programme in Great Britain should be increased to a rate of
300,000 completions a year as soon as practicable. To this end, limitations on the
local authorities’ programmes were relaxed in accordance with the availability of
resources, and encouragement was given by easing the licensing policy to those
wishing to provide homes for themselves. In the calendar year I953» over 318,000
houses were completed in Great Britain and the object of increasing the level of the
programme was thus achieved. Since the middle of 1953 action has been taken to
steady the level of the programme at about 300,000 completions a year.
The amount of private building that local authorities might license was subject
to a maximum ratio to local authority building. For the greater part of the period
up to the end of 1951 the maximum in England and Wales was one privately built
house to four local authority houses. The reasons for giving preference to local
authorities as housebuilders were that they were considered to be in a better posi¬
tion than private enterprise to build houses for letting that would be within the
reach of tenants who could not afford to buy, that local authorities were able to
select tenants according to need, and that the activities of local authorities were
more easily planned than those of private enterprise. From the beginning of 1952
it was found possible and thought desirable to allow private enterprise a larger
share in the programme, without any reduction in the number of houses built by
local authorities.
Post-war Progress
By 30th June 1954, 1-9 million new houses, permanent and temporary, had been
built in Great Britain since early 1945, and over 316,000 more were under construc¬
tion. The total number of families rehoused in this period (by new building, repair
of uninhabitable houses and conversion) was 2,201,461. Of the 1,742,745 permanent
houses built, 337,327 were of non-traditional types constructed with the use of
new methods or materials.
Local authorities in England and Wales had built 1,284,529 of the total number
of new houses and local authorities in Scotland, with the Scottish Special Housing
Association (see p. 323), had built 218,210.
In addition, in Northern Ireland 51,304 houses were built between January 1945
and the end of June 1954, including 18,619 permanent houses built by local
authorities and 12,650 by the Northern Ireland Housing Trust (see p. 324).
HOUSING AND PLANNING
323
Slum Clearance
Because of the need to concentrate on providing new houses for families without
a separate home of their own, slum clearance was virtually in abeyance for some
years after the end of the war, and the number of houses demolished was relatively
small. Early in 1954 local authorities were informed that, in view of the amount
of new housing provided since the war, it had now become an essential part
of the Government’s housing policy that the authorities should take up again,
as a matter of urgency, the campaign of slum clearance which the war interrupted.
Each local authority should determine the pace and phasing of a slum clearance
programme, having regard to the circumstances of its area, and should put such
a programme into operation as soon as possible.
In some areas the number of slum houses is so large that it would not be practic¬
able to replace all of them within five years or so. The Housing Repairs and Rents
Act, 1954, and the corresponding Scottish Act, therefore contain provisions which
empower local authorities to acquire, and to defer the demolition of, houses
unfit for human habitation which are destined for clearance but which cannot be
dealt with for some time to come, because the local slum problem is so large.
To make conditions more tolerable for the occupants, local authorities are
empowered to patch these houses. It has been made clear that patching is to be the
exception and not the rule—to be done only in the comparatively few areas which
have the largest problems—and that these houses are to be demolished as early
as possible; patching is not intended to prolong the life of the slums, or to be an
alternative to slum clearance. Exchequer contributions are available to meet part
of the cost of acquisition and patching.
HOUSING AUTHORITIES
Housing Powers and Duties of Local Authorities
While responsibility for housing policy and for the general execution of the
housing programme rests with the Minister of Housing and Local Government (in
Scotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland, the Minister
of Health and Local Government), local authorities have executive responsibility
for all housing in their areas (including building by Housing Associations, which
are non-profit-making bodies providing houses mostly for letting rather than for
sale, and Self-Help Groups, which build in their spare time for the benefit of
members). In England and Wales and Northern Ireland these authorities are the
councils of county boroughs, boroughs (including metropolitan boroughs), urban
districts and rural districts, the London County Council and the Common Council
of the City of London. In Scotland all town and county councils are housing
authorities.
These authorities are responsible for ensuring as far as possible that housing
conditions in their areas are satisfactory. To this end they must draw up and submit
plans for the provision of new houses in their districts, and ensure that other dwell¬
ings in their areas comply with certain standards of fitness, design, construction,
equipment, etc. They may themselves provide houses for letting by new building
or by the conversion of existing buildings. The Minister has given a general consent
to the sale of houses on certain conditions to occupying tenants or to persons in
need of a house for themselves.
Scottish Special Housing Association
The Scottish Special Housing Association, a statutory body, assists local authori¬
ties in their housing programmes. It has built about one in seven of the permanent
324 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
post-war houses completed in Scotland. The Association is financed entirely from
Government funds and is under the general direction of the Secretary of State for
Scotland.
Northern Ireland Housing Trust
The Northern Ireland Housing Trust, a statutory body, was established in 1945
for the purpose of erecting houses for letting to supplement the activities of local
authorities. The Trust has built about a quarter of Northern Ireland’s post-war
houses.
BUILDING METHODS AND STANDARDS
Non-Traditional and Temporary Housing
Much research has been and is being done on housing design, construction and
equipment. Components have been standardized and new methods and materials
have been evolved to ease the strain on skilled workers and traditional materials.
To help to meet the immediate post-war need, the Government provided over
157,000 temporary factory-built houses for erection on sites provided by local
authorities. Within four years from April 1945 the programme had been completed
at a cost of £216 million for the houses and their erection.
A number of new forms of construction for permanent houses were also
developed with practical encouragement from the Government during the experi¬
mental period. Some types were steel-framed, some of pre-cast concrete, some
concrete poured in situ, and some timber-framed. A number of proved new
systems have been able to compete successfully with traditional house-building
methods, and are making an increasing contribution to the housing programme.
Standards for Housing
Despite shortages, local authorities are now building better houses than before
the second world war.
The central Departments have issued manuals of guidance for local authorities
setting standards of space, structure, design and equipment for different types of
houses, and describing how estates can be laid out attractively while saving land
and money, by the use of new and improved types of layout.
HOUSING FINANCE
Housing Costs and Subsidies
The cost to a local authority of building the average three-bedroom traditional
house in England and Wales (with a superficial area of 1,050 square feet) was about
£1,450 for houses completed in October 1951, with another £240 for land, roads
and services and professional fees. Since 1951 new designs have been introduced to
achieve economies in space and to keep down the cost per house.
To enable local authorities, notwithstanding the high cost of building, to let their
houses at reasonable rents, subsidies are provided under the Housing (Financial
and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1946, and the Housing Act, 1952. Housing
subsidies have existed since 1919, but they are now on a more generous scale than
before the war. The standard rate in England and Wales is £26 14s. per house per
year for 60 years from the Exchequer and £8 18s. from the local authority for
houses completed before 1st April 1955 and £22 is. and £8 18s. respectively for
houses completed after that date.
Special rates of subsidy are provided for special types of housing, including
houses for agricultural workers, houses in poor areas, and flats and houses on
HOUSING AND PLANNING
325
expensive sites, also where expensive works are necessary in order to minimize the
risk of subsidence due to mining operations. All subsidy rates are reviewed annually.
The Housing Act, 1949* provides Exchequer assistance for the improvement of
existing housing or adaptation of buildings for housing by local authorities or
private owners. Orants can be made by local authorities, with Exchequer assistance,
to persons converting or improving existing buildings for housing at a cost of over
£100 a dwelling. The grants may amount to half the cost, with a maximum of £400.
There are certain technical conditions which the dwellings as improved or con¬
verted must satisfy to ensure that public money is only spent on property that will
provide satisfactory accommodation for a sufficient period. The Housing Repairs
and Rents Act, 1954, has considerably eased the conditions attaching to these
grants, and it is the Government’s intention that they shall be much more widely
employed in the future, in order to make the utmost use of the nation’s stock of
existing houses. A subsidy for residential hostels built by local authorities or by
certain other local bodies is also granted under the Act of 1949.
Subsidies are similarly provided in Scotland, though the amounts are generally
higher owing to the different rating system and higher costs.
In Northern Ireland annual subsidies are paid for 60 years to local authorities,
the Northern Ireland Housing Trust and Housing Associations. In addition ‘lump
sum’ subsidies are paid to private persons who build houses for letting or for owner
occupation. Under the Housing on Farms Act (Northern Ireland), 1950, grants are
available for the provision of new houses and for the reconditioning of existing
premises to accommodate farmers and approved workers.
House Purchase Schemes
Loans to enable persons to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
extending over several years are provided by some local authorities as well as by
building societies, certain insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Building societies have not actually built houses for over 100 years, but for a long
time they have been the most important source of finance for private building (see
p. 262).
Rent Control
The great majority of the privately owned houses in Great Britain which are let
are subject to rent control. Houses owned by local authorities are, in general, free
from control, as are new houses completed since 30th August 1954.
The first Rent Restrictions Act was passed in 1915. The Acts now in force in
England and Wales, either wholly or in part, are the Rent and Mortgage Interest
Restrictions Acts, 1920 to 1939, the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act, 1949,
and the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. These Rent Restrictions Acts, which
apply, with few exceptions, to all unfurnished dwellings below a certain rateable
value, achieve their purpose of preventing undue rises in rent, liable to result from
housing shortages, by limiting the rent a landlord may legally recover from a
tenant, while at the same time giving the tenant in most circumstances security of
tenure. The Acts also make illegal most premiums for the grant of a tenancy of
rent-controlled premises. Landlords restricted in this way are themselves protected
against undue increases in rates of mortgage interest and against the calling in of
mortgages so long as they pay the restricted interest due. This protection applies to
anyone buying a controlled house on mortgage. The standard rent (i.e. the
maximum the landlord can recover) is fixed by reference to the rent payable on a
certain date (for ‘old control’ houses 3rd August 1914; for ‘new control’ houses
1st September 1939). The standard rent of a house let for the first time since
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
326
1st September 1939 is the rent at which it was first let, except where this rent is
reduced by a rent tribunal, which on the application of either party will determine
a reasonable rent.
The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, allows landlords to increase their
rents to pay for repairs, subject to certain conditions and to a maximum limit. This
is part of the Government’s policy of making the utmost use of existing accommoda¬
tion. Broadly similar provisions apply in Scotland under the Housing (Repairs and
Rents) (Scotland) Act, 1954.
The rents payable for furnished accommodation in England and Wales are con¬
trolled by the Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act, 1946. The Act provides for
the control of rents of houses or parts of houses let furnished or with services, with¬
out limitation by rent or rateable value. Local rent tribunals, appointed for the
purpose, determine the rents of furnished lettings in cases referred to them by
either party or by the local authority. Similar legislation for controlling rents of
furnished lettings was passed for Scotland in 1943.
A somewhat similar measure of control applies in Northern Ireland. In i95I>
however, legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of
‘old control’ houses provided they were maintained in good and accountable repair.
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
The land of Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world
and it is therefore of vital importance in the public interest that competing claims
to its use should be settled in such a way that the necessary balance between them
is maintained.
From 1909 onwards, the idea of the planned use of land was given a degree of
expression in successive Acts of Parliament, but because the pattern of develop¬
ment over much of the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban
concentrations (as a result of the industrialization processes of the previous century)
the powers granted to planning authorities by the early Acts were inadequate for
the task in hand.
The twenty years between the two world wars were also decades of expansion in
industry, engineering and house-building; the population was increasing, and
there was a general movement towards better standards of living which required
more space for individual members of the community. At the beginning of the
nineteen-thirties, a major effort was made to consolidate and strengthen planning
law and to extend the planning powers of central and local authorities to the point
at which they could exercise effective control. Despite this effort, which culmin¬
ated in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, inter-war planning legislation
had only a limited effect, mainly because it failed to deal adequately with the
question of compensation, which had always been an obstacle to satisfactory
planning. By the nineteen-twenties, the principle had been accepted that the
property of an individual might be subjected to restrictions in the public interest,
provided that he received some compensation out of public funds for any depriva¬
tion which went beyond the requirements of good neighbourliness that he might
suffer thereby. The method adopted for implementing this principle, however,
placed so heavy a financial burden on planning authorities that they were often
prevented from, or at least hampered in, carrying out their work. As a result, at
the time of the outbreak of the second world war many of the outstanding problems
of land use remained unsolved.
Renewed efforts were made to deal with these problems during the course of
the war. Between 1939 and 1943 three expert committees were appointed to study
HOUSING AND PLANNING
327
and report upon (a) the unregulated growth and spread of industry, (b) the
hampering of planning by the financial and administrative difficulties of compensa¬
tion and betterment and (c) the encroachment of urban development upon the
countryside. After the war, two other committees studied the question of New
Towns and National Parks respectively.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these five committees
have now been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the Distribution of
Industry Act, 1945; the New Towns Act, 1946; the Town and Country Planning
Act, 1947; the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947; the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949; and the Town and Country
Planning Acts, 1953 and 1954.
The Town and Country Planning Acts
The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947. are comprehensive and radical measures which
provide a framework or pattern of land use for the whole of Great Britain (the
Acts do not apply to Northern Ireland). Their main purposes are:
1. To co-ordinate planning throughout the country by means of development
plans against which day-to-day development can be considered.
2. To extend both the powers of public authorities to acquire and develop
land for planning purposes and the scope and scale of grants from central
funds to local authorities towards carrying out the acquisition and redevelop¬
ment of land.
3. To bring all development, with certain exceptions, under control by making
it subject to planning permission from a local planning authority or from the
central Government in order that land should be put to its best use in the
interests of the community as a whole. Under this control, building over
good agricultural land or on land containing valuable mineral deposits may
be prevented, the outward sprawl of great towns may be restrained, living
conditions and industrial efficiency may be improved, and the countryside
and coastline may be preserved from further disfigurement and destruction.
4. To deal with certain specific problems of amenity, e.g., the preservation of
trees and woodlands and of buildings of special architectural and historic
interest, and the control of the display of advertisements.
The 1947 Acts were also intended to solve the compensation-betterment
problem; and, to this end, they provided for the transfer of development values in
land to the State, the establishment of a system of ‘development charges’ payable
before development could take place by any person whose land was increased in
value by the grant of planning permission to develop, and the setting up of a
£300 million fund from which payments could be made to owners whose land was
depreciated in value by the Acts. It was hoped that by these provisions the pre¬
war obstacles to effective planning might be removed; but, in the event, serious
difficulties were encountered in the working of the system, due mainly to the fact
that the development charge became in effect a tax on development. The financial
provisions of the 1947 Acts have therefore been amended in three subsequent
Acts: the Town and Country Planning Act, 1953, which abolished the development
charges and suspended payment from the £300 million fund; and the Town and
Country Planning Act, 1954, and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act,
1954, which provided a new scheme for the payment of compensation for deprecia¬
tion in land values and a new basis of compensation for public acquisition. Under
Y
BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
328
the terms of the Acts, claims for compensation out of the £300 million fund form
the basis for all future compensation payments, but payments will not actually be
made unless and until loss is suffered. Since development charges have been
abolished, owners will normally be able to realize the full value of their land on
the open market and compensation will, in fact, become payable only when land
is acquired by a public authority or restricted against development. Loss of
development value through the imposition of planning restrictions, other than
restrictions in the interests of ‘good neighbourliness’, is to be met by the State,
in order that local planning authorities shall continue to be relieved of the burden of
paying the compensation for which they were responsible until the passing of the
1947 Acts. On compulsory acquisition, compensation is paid for development
value only if a claim on the £300 million fund exists and up to the value of the
claim.
The Acts also contain provision for a simplified and extended system of planning
grants to local planning authorities to replace that of the 1947 Acts, and a transi¬
tional system of payments, again based on claims, to redress the financial effects on
owners of land of the now discontinued development charge scheme.
Development Plans
Under the terms of the 1947 Acts, local planning authorities in England and
Wales and in Scotland are required to prepare, and submit to the Minister of
Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland respec¬
tively, development plans covering the whole of their districts, based on a careful
survey of physical and other resources. The local authorities for the purpose are:
in England and Wales, the county councils, the county borough councils, or where
necessary, joint planning boards; and in Scotland, the county councils or joint
county councils, the large burghs, two small burghs, or, if appointed, joint planning
committees. Smaller units of local government may assist in the work in areas of
interest to them, and provision is made for public inquiry before any plan receives
ministerial approval, so that persons whose land is affected may have an oppor¬
tunity to state their case.
By the end of March 1954, all but seven of the local planning authorities in
England and Wales had submitted completed plans to the Minister of Housing and
Local Government. By the same date in Scotland, 28 of the 57 local planning
authorities had submitted plans to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Individual plans for the reconstruction of parts of many of the large towns
and cities in Great Britain have also been drawn up and approved; and special
provision has been made for rebuilding the centres of those of them that were
badly damaged during the war. By the end of 1953, works valued at about £i4'6
million had been completed, further work of reconstruction costing about £10
million had been authorized in provincial cities in England and Wales and
£10 million had been made available for this purpose in the City of London.
The Distribution of Industry
The Distribution of Industry Acts, 1945 and 1950, and the Town and Country
Planning Acts, 1947, contain provisions to control the general location of industry
throughout the country. Under the terms of the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945,
he Board of Trade, as the responsible Department, has wide powers to promote
industrial development in the Development Areas,1 i.e. areas in Britain which, in
1 All action in connection with development areas in Scotland is taken by the President
of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Scotland, acting jointly.
HOUSING AND PLANNING
329
the past, have been peculiarly liable to severe unemployment in times of depression
owing to their dependence for employment and prosperity on a few basic industries
(see p. 117).
The Board of Trade is also responsible, under the terms of the Town and
Country Planning Acts, 1947, for certifying that any proposed industrial develop¬
ment involving the erection of industrial buildings of more than 5,000 square feet
can be carried out consistently with the proper distribution of industry, before
permission to develop can be given by the local planning authorities. General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of Govern¬
ment Departments, but the main responsibility for controlling the siting of industry
as apart from its general location rests with the local planning authorities, for it is
their duty to ensure that industrial development fits properly into existing and
expanding communities and is consistent with the best use of land.
The New Towns
The New Towns Act, 1946, gives the Government powers to create new towns
when it is in the public interest so to do. Under the terms of the Act, the Minister
of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who
are the responsible ministers, may, after consultation with the local authorities
concerned, make an order designating any area of land (which might include as
its nucleus the area of an existing town) as the site of a proposed new town. Once
the site has been designated, the responsible minister appoints a Development
Corporation (consisting of a chairman and up to eight other members) to be
responsible for the development of the new town. One of the first tasks of the
development corporation, when appointed, is to prepare a master plan which,
when it has received ministerial approval, becomes the basis for the detailed
planning of the area. These details must likewise be submitted to the responsible
minister, who must consult the appropriate local planning authority before the
detailed proposals can be approved.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the consent of
the Minister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for
Scotland) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, any land or property
necessary for their purposes. They may provide housing, commercial and industrial
premises, estate roads and sewers and other buildings essential for the development
of the towns; and, in certain circumstances, they may make provision for main
services. In England and Wales, the Minister of Housing and Local Government
has made a special development order to exempt the development corporations
from the necessity of obtaining planning permission from the local planning
authorities; but in Scotland, in the absence of a similar order, permission to develop
has to be obtained from the local planning authority.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations
from public funds and must be repaid on terms approved by the ministers with
the concurrence of the Treasury. The corporations must submit their reports
annually to the Minister or to the Secretary of State for Scotland, who are
responsible for laying them before Parliament; their accounts must be audited
annually and are then presented to Parliament by the Comptroller and Auditor
General.
When the purposes for which development corporations are established have
been substantially achieved, the corporations are to be dissolved and the towns
handed over to the appropriate local authorities, on terms settled by agreement, or
after reference to the House of Commons.
There are now 12 new towns in England and Wales and two in Scotland. Eight
330
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of these—Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Hemel Hempstead, Stevenage, Hatfield
and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex; and Bracknell in Berkshire—
are designed to help in absorbing excess population from the Greater London
area; four—Corby in Northamptonshire; Aycliffe and Peterlee in Durham;
and Cwmbran in Monmouthshire—are to serve the special needs of their areas.
Of the Scottish new towns, East Kilbride in Lanarkshire is designed to take the
surplus population from Glasgow; and Glenrothes in Fife to serve the general
needs of the surrounding area.
In spite of the fact that the development corporations have been somewhat
handicapped by shortages of materials and labour and by restrictions on capital
investment, their work represents a notable achievement in the translation of
planning into reality. By the end of October 1954 the total population of the new
towns in England and Wales, designed to be 545,000 when the towns are completed,
had reached the figure of 216,160 (including the people previously living in the
area); a total of 25,629 houses had been built by the development corporations
with a further 11,233 under construction; 118 factories had been established and
a further 74 were being erected; 291 shops had been completed and 276 more were
being built; 37 schools had been finished and 36 more were under construction.
Many miles of roads had been laid and large main sewerage works had gone well
ahead of housing needs.
In the Scottish new towns, particularly satisfactory progress was made during
the year ended October 1954, by which date 3,416 houses had been built by the
development corporations with a further 2,033 under construction; 32 shops had
been completed and 16 were under construction; four new schools were in use
and the building of a further four was in progress; and the extension of com¬
munications and public services was under way.
Under the New Towns Acts of 1946, 1952 and 1953, £150 million was advanced
from the Exchequer to the development corporations for work on the new towns.
By 31st October 1954, £141 million of expenditure from this amount had been
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. In December 1954 a New Towns Bill was presented to Parlia¬
ment with the object of providing the corporations with an additional £100 million
to enable them to meet their commitments during the next two years.
National Parks, Access to the Countryside and Nature Conservation
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949, provided for the
designation of a number of extensive areas of beautiful and relatively wild country
in England and Wales as National Parks. The characteristic landscape of these
areas is to be carefully preserved, and facilities for open-air recreation are to be
improved or provided.
A National Parks Commission for England and Wales was set up by the Act
of 1949, and by the end of October 1954 the first eight of the 12 National Parks
recommended by the National Parks (England and Wales) Committee (which
reported in 1947) had been established, with a total area of 4,380 square miles.
These are: the Peak District, the Lake District, Snowdonia in North Wales,
Dartmoor in Devonshire, the Pembrokeshire Coast in South Wales, the North
York Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, and Exmoor in Somerset and Devon. Adminis¬
trative systems are now in operation for six of the parks, as follows: The Peak and
Lake District National Parks are administered by Joint Planning Boards; for Dart¬
moor, the Pembrokeshire Coast and the North York Moors, special Park Planning
Committees of the county councils concerned have been set up; while in Snowdonia,
rl<f New Towns

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a Joint Advisory Committee advises the three county councils who continue to be
responsible for planning.
The Scottish National Parks Working Party has considered all five areas recom¬
mended as National Parks in Scotland—the Trossachs, Glen Affric, the Cairngorms,
Wester Ross (Loch Maree) and Glen Coe—with a view to their possible develop¬
ment under existing statutory powers, and has submitted to the Secretary of State
for Scotland a report on each of these areas (see map p. 331).
The Nature Conservancy (see p.348) was given powers under the National
Parks Act to acquire by purchase, lease or gift, land or properties necessary for
the furtherance of its objects. At the end of November 1954 there were 19 Nature
Reserves in England and Wales (see map p. 331). By the same date the Nature
Conservancy, on the advice of its Scottish Committee, had established the first
four national Nature Reserves in Scotland (see map p. 331); of these the Cairn¬
gorms Reserve, which accounts for 39,639 acres of the total of 71,153 acres of
reserves in the whole of Great Britain, is the largest reserve in Great Britain and
the second largest in Europe. The Conservancy has also been consulted by local
authorities, using their own powers under the National Parks Act to set up local
nature reserves.
The National Parks Act also provides for (a) a complete survey of all footpaths
and bridle ways in Great Britain to be a comprehensive national record of public
rights of way and (b) long-distance routes connecting footpaths and bridleways as
continuous rights of way. Individual surveys of footpaths are being carried out
by parish and county district councils; on completion, they will be collated and
published by the county councils. Responsibility for making proposals for the
provision and maintenance of long-distance routes rests with the National Parks
Commission; once the proposals are approved by the Minister of Housing and
Local Government, it falls to the local authorities to give effect to them. The
provision of four routes has so far been approved: the Pennine Way, which runs
from Edale in the Peak District to the Scottish Border, a distance of some 250
miles; a Pembrokeshire coastal path; a path along the north coast of Devon and
Cornwall around Land’s End to Penzance; and an extension of this coast path
from Penzance along the south coast. Other routes under consideration are Offa’s
Dyke, running from the coast of Flintshire down the Welsh Marches to Chepstow,
and a further continuation of the Cornish coastal path along the coasts of Devon,
Dorset and Somerset.
The Act also gives local authorities the task of surveying in their areas the access
enjoyed by the public to open country, i.e. mountain, moor, heath, down, cliff and
beach, and empowers them to improve such access where necessary by means of
agreements with owners, or by access orders.
Preservation of Amenities
Responsibility for the preservation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain (from tree preservation and the preservation of ancient
inns to the protection of buildings against atmospheric pollution) is vested mainly
in the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and the various statutory planning authorities and commissions. The
Ministry of Works, however, is also concerned, in that it is the Department
responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and, in addition, is
empowered by the provisions of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments
Act, 1953, to assist in the preservation of historic houses by making grants (after
consultation with specially constituted Building Councils) for their upkeep
together with their contents and their adjoining land. By November 1954, 86 such
HOUSING AND PLANNING
333
grants, totalling £215,000, had been approved towards the cost of urgently needed
structural repairs to historic buildings in England, Scotland and Wales.
Unofficial amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their
members, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, founded
in 1926 to organize concerted action to secure the protection of rural scenery
and of town and country amenities from disfigurement or injury; the Association
for the Preservation of Rural Scotland, founded in 1927 for the protection of rural
scenery and the amenities of country districts and towns and villages in Scotland;
the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the Society for
the Protection of Ancient Buildings; the Pilgrim Trust (see p. 356); the National
Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland1; and the National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust for
England, Wales and Northern Ireland (which was founded in 1895 and by mid-
1954 had nearly 50,000 members) is the largest landowner in the United Kingdom
other than the State and State institutions. It has acquired, mainly through gifts,
about a thousand properties, which it holds for the enjoyment of the public; it
administers over 200,000 acres of land of great natural beauty (including 30,000
acres of woodland); and it owns many fine gardens. The National T rust for Scotland,
which was founded in 1931 to save properties of natural beauty or historic or archi¬
tectural interest in Scotland for the future enjoyment of the public, administers over
55,000 acres of land (including 1,100 acres of woodland) on which there are more
than 60 properties.
Planning in Northern Ireland
Planning legislation in Northern Ireland provides for the preparation by local
authorities of planning schemes for the development or redevelopment of their
areas with the object of securing proper sanitary conditions, adequate amenities and
the most suitable laying out and use of land. Since the passing of the Planning
(Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 1944, the authorities concerned
have made appreciable progress in the preparation of outline advisory plans, which
indicate broadly the proposals for their areas. These plans provide a foundation
for the preparation of more detailed plans at a later stage and facilitate the control
of development pending the completion of the final schemes.

Ireland, see p. 360.
XII. RELIGION, SCIENCE,
AND THE ARTS
RELIGION
Every person living in Britain possesses the rights of religious freedom as they
are described in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; that is,
he may change his religion at will and may manifest his religion in teaching,
practice, worship and observance. Churches and religious societies of any faith may
own property, conduct schools and propagate their faith in speech and writing.
Freedom of conscience for minority religious groups and for non-religious groups
has been achieved gradually and not without a struggle.
The Church of England and the Anglican Communion
The Church of England ‘by law established’ occupies a middle position between
the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestantism of continental Europe. At the
Reformation it repudiated the supremacy of the Pope and certain religious doctrines
but retained the creeds, the historic episcopate and liturgical worship, the last being
embodied in the Book of Common Prayer. Religious Orders were restored a hundred
years ago. No single law defines the establishment of the Church of England in any
such way as, for example, the Act of Union, i7°7> defines the position of the Church
of Scotland. The relation of Church and State in England is one of mutual obliga¬
tions, of privileges accorded to the Church but balanced by certain duties. The
Church of England is uniquely related to the Crown. The Sovereign, who must be a
member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the Faith’, a statutory
title as protector of the Church, and promises on his or her Accession to uphold it.
Prayers for the Sovereign are said in all the statutory services of the Church and the
clergy take the oath of allegiance to the Crown.
The second link of Church and State is through the House of Lords, in which
the two archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 bishops have seats. This makes
it possible for the mind of the Church to be freely expressed on any great moral
issue raised in connection with the corporate conduct of the State, as well as on
more narrowly ecclesiastical issues. Clergy of the Church of England are legally
disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons. All bishops and deans are
appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister. The State upholds
sentences passed in ecclesiastical courts (see p. 71)- The highest court of appeal
from an ecclesiastical court is the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
The State recognizes and protects church property. It makes no payments to the
Church except for services rendered (e.g., chaplaincies to the armed forces and to
prisons). ‘Church property’ belongs to parishes, dioceses or church societies. An
investigation in 1951 showed that half the Church’s income came from present
giving and half from past giving, in the form of endowments. Endowments pro¬
duced an income of £8f million a year and, of this total, property representing an
annual income of £7 million was administered by the Church Commissioners, most
of it for specific purposes from which it could not be transferred. rI he present figure
for property administered by the Church Commissioners is £84: million a year, but
there may be other factors affecting the aggregate which any new inquiry would
have to take into account. The State is represented on this body and it reports
annually to Parliament.
The Established Church is not free to change its forms of worship, as laid down
334
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 335
in the Book of Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament. A proposed
revision (1928) was accepted by the Church Assembly and the Convocations of
Canterbury and York (see below), though with substantial minority opposition in
some of the Houses, but was rejected by the House of Commons. A Church-
appointed commission on Church-State relations reported in January 1952 and
suggested certain changes in the relations between Church and State, but it was
opposed to disestablishment; its report was unanimously accepted by the Church
Assembly.
The Church is organized mainly by geographical areas (parishes and dioceses),
and not by congregations. Every Englishman is born in a parish—about two-thirds
being baptized by the Established Church—and he tends to look to the Church for
personal services (baptism of children, marriage and burial) and to expect it to play
a part in local life. Only those who are baptized and confirmed may receive the
Holy Communion but anyone who is baptized and not a member of another Church
and who is over 18 years of age may apply for membership of the electoral roll of
the parish where he habitually worships. The total number on the roll is just under
3 million, but this figure does not represent anything like the total Church
membership.
Spiritual authority in the Church of England rests in the bishops. There are 43
dioceses, 29 in the province of Canterbury and 14 in that of York. The most ancient
authoritative bodies in the Church in matters of doctrine and discipline are the
Convocations of Canterbury and York. Each is presided over by its archbishop and
consists of an upper house of bishops and a lower house of deans, archdeacons and
elected clergy. The Houses of Convocation meet separately or together in May
and October.
In 1919 by Act of Parliament the Church of England was given a National
Assembly, commonly called the Church Assembly. This consists of three houses,
Bishops, Clergy and Laity. The Laity (346 in number, including about 85 women)
are elected on the basis of the electoral rolls to represent their dioceses. The Church
Assembly may pass regulations and measures. Regulations affect matters which do
not require parliamentary consent; thus, for example, the Diocesan Conferences
were set up in 1935 by regulation. Measures, when passed through successive
stages, are presented to the Ecclesiastical Committee (15 members from the House
of Commons and 15 from the House of Lords). This committee reports on the
expediency and possible legal results of the measure. On its advice the measure is
either laid before Parliament and forwarded on resolution for the Royal Assent or,
more rarely, is the subject of debate like any other Bill. The advantages to the State
are the removal of the greater part of church business from its overcrowded debating
time, and to the Church the initiation, discussion and framing of necessary matters
by a fully representative church body and their speedy passing into operation.
The Assembly co-ordinates the vast scattered labours of the Church through
Councils which report to it annually. The Training Colleges Council maintains 24
colleges for the training of teachers—an indication of the part played by the Church
in the country’s educational system. The Schools Council, in co-operation with the
National Society, deals with matters affecting the Church Schools. Other councils
include the Central Advisory Council of Training for the Ministry. Selection of
ordination candidates lies in the power of the bishops, but they have recently agreed
that candidates under 40 years of age shall attend one of the Council’s ‘selection
centres’ where a group of assessors spend several days with the men and discuss
with them the future training which would best suit their needs. There are at
present 24 theological colleges in England, one in Ireland, one in Scotland, and
two in Wales.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
336
At the time when the Church Assembly was set up the laity were associated in
the government of the local churches through new elected bodies, the Parochial
Church Councils.
There are Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but these are not
established. The Church of Ireland has 14 dioceses or united dioceses, and some
400,000 members; the Episcopal Church in Scotland, seven dioceses and some
106,000 members; and the Church in Wales, six dioceses and some 200,000
members.
Outside the United Kingdom the Anglican Communion exists wherever English¬
men have gone as settlers, traders and missionaries. The Protestant Episcopal
Church in the United States of America, the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and
Ceylon, and the Anglican Churches of South Africa, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, the West Indies, China, Japan, and West Africa are all autonomous
members of the Anglican Communion, while there are 21 oversea dioceses, mainly
in Africa and Asia, which are under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
On 8th May 1955 two of these Church of England dioceses, namely Nyasaland
and Northern Rhodesia, will join with the dioceses of Mashonaland and Matabele-
land from the Church of the Province of South Africa to form a new autonomous
Church of the Province of Central Africa, the Archbishops of Canterbury and Cape
Town respectively relinquishing their jurisdictions in these areas.
Since 1867, except for the war years, the Lambeth Conference has met every
tenth year as an unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops. It has no
authority but enjoys great moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline,
relations with other communions, and on the attitude of the Churches to political
and social questions are widely read. In August I954> the first of a series of Anglican
Congresses, including clergy not in episcopal orders and laymen as well as bishops,
was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A. The Congresses will take place
between the Lambeth Conferences.
The Church of Scotland
The established Church in Scotland is the Church of Scotland, which in
government is Presbyterian. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a
Church which is established and yet is free’. Whereas Episcopacy in church
government is a hierarchy of persons, in Presbyterianism there is a hierarchy of
courts. All ministers are of equal status, and the Church is governed locally by the
Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and elected elders: above this is the court
of the Presbytery, then that of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly,
which meets annually and consists of elected ministers and elders presided over by
an elected Moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at
the General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner. The complete indepen¬
dence of the Church of Scotland to appoint its own officers and decide all matters
of doctrine and discipline has been fought for by the Church with the utmost
vigour down the years. The freedom of the Church is recognized by Parliament
without being the subject of debate or modification. The thorough training of the
ministry—lasting a minimum of six years—has given the Church a high reputation
for scholarship and has in turn influenced the standard of education in the
country. The communicant membership of the Church is over a million and a
quarter.
The Free Churches
The largest of the Free Churches, formerly more generally known as the
Nonconformist Churches, is the Methodist Church, the product of a union
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 337
of Methodist Churches in 1932. It has three-quarters of a million adult full
members. The supreme authority in the Church is the Annual Conference and the
system of government is in many ways presbyterian; the Leaders’ Meeting corre¬
sponding to the Kirk Session, with Circuit Meetings and District Synods resemb¬
ling Presbytery and Synod. It is not, however, the form of government that distin¬
guishes Methodism from other Churches. Starting as a powerful evangelistic
movement within the Church of England in the eighteenth century under the
leadership of the brothers John and Charles Wesley, the Methodists had no idea
of founding a Church until forbidden to preach by ecclesiastical authority. One of
the Church s characteristics is its strong emphasis on lay leadership. There are
more than 25,000 trained lay preachers sharing the ministers’ work and preaching
in thousands of local churches.
The Congregational and Baptist Churches both regard the Church as a cove¬
nanted fellowship of believers, ministers being called to special service and set aside,
trained and recognized by the Church. Local churches have formed county and
national unions, whose secretariat and assemblies, however, have no compulsive
authority over them, though much influence.
The Congregationalists in Britain number 227,000 and the Baptists 335,600
adult members. The importance they both attach to the autonomy of the local
church meeting has been an influential factor in the development of British demo¬
cratic methods. They both admit women to the ministry. Baptists differ from
Congregationalists in not practising infant baptism.
T he Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from
the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in 1735, embraces a large section
of the Welsh-speaking population: its adherents number some 211,000.
Next in size among Presbyterian Churches is the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.
The Presbyterian Church of England is organized in 14 Presbyteries and its highest
court is the General Assembly. It admits women to the eldership.
The Society of Friends, or Quakers, founded in the middle of the seventeenth
century by George Fox, have no ordained ministry, and do not observe the Sacra¬
ments. They have borne a consistent witness to pacifism, arid their influence,
especially in social reform and the relief of suffering, has been out of all proportion
to their number (20,000). There are about 300 Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches united by loyalty to the principle of freedom of thought in religion. Since
1904 they have admitted women to the ministry. The Salvation Army, founded in
1878 by William Booth, a Methodist, replaces ecclesiastical by military terminology.
William Booth’s mission to the poorest attracted first the scorn and then the respect
of a large public. The movement is now world-wide and its social work is well
supported.
The Christian Scientists have over 340 branch churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church
The Roman Catholic Church in the United Kingdom claims nearly four million
adherents including children. The head of the Church in England is the Cardinal
Archbishop of Westminster. There are 18 dioceses and nearly 2,000 parishes. The
Church attaches great importance to educating children in its own schools.
Schools, social work and many institutions are staffed by the great Roman Catholic
Orders for men and women.
Jewry
The virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on the Continent has left
English Jewry as the largest group of Jews in Europe. These same events have
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
338
caused religious organizations among Jews to gain in numbers and influence. The
two main divisions are between Orthodox and Progressive Jews and each has
within it several groups of congregations and synagogues. The Chief Rabbi is the
head of the largest group within the Orthodox Jews.
Other Non-Christian Communities
Among other non-Christian communities in Britain, the Muslims are the most
widely represented. The principal mosque is the Shah Jehan Mosque at Woking,
and there are also mosques in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and
Glasgow.
A Buddhist temple was ceremonially opened in South Kensington, London, in
May 1954.
Co-operation between Churches
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation
between the Churches. The British Council of Churches was founded in 1942 an<^
includes official representatives from all the Churches of the British Isles with the
exception of the Roman Catholic Church. The Council facilitates common action
between the Churches and seeks to further the cause of Christian unity. The
Archbishop of Canterbury is President. In addition, many though not all of the
Free Churches in Britain are members of the Free Church Federal Council
(formed in 1940 by the amalgamation of the Federal Council of Evangelical Free
Churches with the National Free Church Council) the aims of which are to
promote unity and joint action between the Free Churches and to provide a channel
through which the Free Churches can communicate and negotiate with central
and local government organs as a united body.
The Church of England, the Church of Scotland and the Free Churches in
England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales also participate in the World Council of
Churches which was constituted at Amsterdam, Holland, in 1948, and held its
Second Assembly at Evanston, Illinois, U.S.A., in August 1954- The Council
links together 163 Churches in 48 nations for co-operation in action and the study
of common problems.
Co-operation of other Churches with the Roman Catholic Church takes place on
specific issues but there is no machinery of continued co-operation. The Council of
Christians and Jews works for better understanding between members of the two
religions, and deals with problems arising in the social field.
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
While the promotion of the sciences in the United Kingdom is largely the
concern of those learned societies and institutions devoted specifically to this end,
only a small part of the research which is vital to science is carried out directly by
them. Most of the ‘pure’ or ‘fundamental’ research is conducted in the universities,
which also play an essential part in promoting the sciences by maintaining a steady
supply of trained scientists. In practice it has become impossible to distinguish
clearly between science and its extensive applications in everyday life, with the
result that scientific research in the widest sense has become the concern also of
industry and of various Departments of Government.
In recent years it has become an acknowledged responsibility of the Government
not only to undertake research directly but also to keep under review the facilities
for the training of scientists, to encourage fundamental research, to finance certain
research projects, and to ensure that adequate research is directed to matters of
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 339
national interest. As a result a system of collaboration has developed between the
universities, industry, the learned societies and the Government which is of great
value to the community and leaves the greatest possible measure of freedom to
individual scientists.
Though scientific research is carried out mainly under three different kinds of
administration university, industry and Government—there is strong liaison and
close co-operation between them, while the learned societies remain free to play a
most important part in the discussion and publication of the results of research.
Important work is also undertaken by independent organizations—for example,
in medical research, by the British Empire Cancer Campaign, the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund, the Nuffield Foundation, the Lister Institute of Preventive
Medicine, and by some large pharmaceutical firms. The Nuffield Foundation,
which was established by Lord Nuffield in i943> has a wider scope. Its aims are:
the advancement of health and the prevention and relief of sickness; the advance¬
ment of social well-being; the care and comfort of the aged poor; the advancement
of education; and such other charitable purposes as shall be declared by Lord
Nuffield in his lifetime and by the trustees after his death. Prominent among the
Foundation’s many activities are the promotion of medical, scientific and social
research and the development of medical services and of technical and commercial
education. Its resources consist of a fund of £10 million provided by Lord Nuffield
and of gifts and bequests from other persons. The Foundation’s total income over
the ten years 1943 to 1953 was £5,245,675 and its grants in that period totalled
£4,208,586.
THE LEARNED SOCIETIES
The learned societies have had a profound and lasting influence upon the develop¬
ment and organization of science in Britain; not only have they provided the back¬
ground for the continuity of research from the seventeenth century onwards, but
they have been a meeting ground where all scientists can forgather for the exchange
of ideas, and a reliable source from which new ideas for the enrichment of know¬
ledge can flow. Although today the bulk of research operations is conducted under
auspices other than theirs, the learned societies have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of scientific knowledge and the application of new
discoveries.
At present there are over 200 learned scientific societies in Britain with approxi¬
mately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical institutions
and professional associations, many of which are playing a distinguished part in
promoting their own branches of science and are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members. Prominent examples of these are the
British Medical Association, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of
Mechanical Engineers, the Institution of Electrical Engineers, the Institution of
Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Physics, and the
Institute of Biology.
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs, although for two centuries scientists were in a minority among its
members, whose interests lay mainly in history, art, archaeology or exploration. The
Society has always been independent of State control but its advice on scientific
matters has frequently been sought by the Government. Today its influence remains
as strong as ever and its Fellows serve on most, if not all, of the Advisory Councils
of Government Departments.
In addition the Society is responsible for the administration of many research
funds and special funds derived from various sources and a number of Government
340 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
grants. These funds and grants are used for the promotion of science through
research, publications, congresses, the award of medals, lectures, and in many other
ways. Its Fellowship consists of approximately 500 eminent scientists and 50 foreign
members. Admission of the former is restricted to 25 a year, and of the latter to four
a year; a few eminent non-scientists are also elected to Fellowships. The Society
maintains a library (145,000 books of a purely scientific nature), issues a large
number of publications, including the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings
and convenes conferences which are attended by scientists from all countries.
The Royal Society of Arts (originally the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce) was founded in i754> an^ as ^ was first society
of its kind its work was at first very wide, covering scientific, technical, industrial and
commercial matters on a world-wide scale. As institutions devoted to the specialized
branches of science and industry came to be established, the Society gradually
abandoned some of its earlier fields of work, but it is still a recognized forum for the
discussion of technical and other subjects.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching
the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the ‘promotion of
chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts and manufactures ,
and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’. Its character, however, was
largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday who
established a tradition of research. Today the Institution has extensive research
laboratories, and lectures are given on the recent developments in science and other
branches of knowledge. Its library of 70,000 books includes many early scientific
works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831 to
promote general interest in science and its applications. At the present day one of
its chief activities is the Annual Meeting. Its 13 sections cover the whole range of
pure and applied science other than medical science, and there is a division for
studying the social and international relations of science. Collaboration with other
scientific organizations has always been an important function of the British
Association, and it has an organized relationship with over 150 scientific bodies
and learned societies. It has also played an important part in the development of
science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery and
application of scientific knowledge.
THE UNIVERSITIES
The universities carry the main responsibility for the pursuit of fundamental
research and for the training of scientists. During recent years there has also been
a considerable expansion of technological training and research facilities within the
universities, all of which now offer work in one or more technological subjects
(applied science, engineering, metallurgy, industrial fermentation, etc.). Early in
1953 it was decided that the Imperial College of Science and Technology (part of
London University) should undergo a major expansion with the aim of increasing
the number of scientists and technologists under full-time training from the present
figure of 1,650 to 3,000 by the end of 1962.
The 20 universities and the 4 university colleges in the United Kingdom (see
p. 314) all have laboratories or research departments. Over two-thirds of the income
of the universities comes from Government sources. There is no direct depart¬
mental control and the method of administering the grant—through the University
Grants Committee (see p. 314)—ensures academic freedom. Additional funds for
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 341
the prosecution of research are also secured in some instances by the private endow¬
ment of research fellowships generally awarded by the universities to selected
persons, or by grants from outside bodies tenable at the universities. Examples are
the Leverhulme Fellowships, the Imperial Chemical Industries Fellowships and
the research grants of the Nuffield Foundation.
The universities are also assisted by grants from industry and commerce and
from the Government Research Councils. An example of the close co-operation
that has been achieved between several branches of industry and the research
departments of universities is the Glass Delegation of the University of Sheffield.
This is responsible for the general direction of the work of the Department of Glass
Technology and is composed of members appointed by the Council of the Univer¬
sity and representatives of firms and companies who subscribe funds for the
furtherance of training and research. By these means the universities are closely
associated with the Government research departments and with the most important
industries in the country.
RESEARCH IN INDUSTRY
Industrial research in Great Britain is conducted by individual industrial firms
and organizations independently of Government aid, by co-operative Research
Associations which make use of facilities afforded by the Government, by sponsored
research institutes, and by universities and a number of the major technical colleges.
The main nationalized industries have their own research establishments and
also give financial support to organizations concerned with research into matters
of interest to them. An account of the provision for research by the National Coal
Board, the British Electricity Authority and the Gas Council is given on pp. 153,
160, and 163, respectively.
Industrial Organizations
The Industrial Research Secretariat of the Federation of British Industries has
conducted a comprehensive survey (1945-46) of the research work done in private
organizations {Scientific and Technical Research in British Industry, FBI, July 1947).
This showed that about 1,000 British firms were conducting research: 420 spent at
least £1,000 a year on research, and the total sum spent by industry on research
and development was approximately £30 million. The number of workers engaged
in industrial research was estimated at 45,000; about 10,000 were qualified staff
wifh a university degree or equivalent, and nearly one-half of these were chemists.
About 100 firms had first-class research facilities and extensive research programmes
which embraced both pure and applied research. The survey showed that about
300 firms were in touch with universities and technical colleges on research ques¬
tions, and 60 firms had a very close connection, through endowing scholarships and
research fellowships, with appropriate universities. It also revealed that more than
300 of the firms surveyed were members of a Research Association and that more
than half of these were members of more than one Research Association.
A later report {Research and Development in British Industry, FBI, July 1952)
suggested that, in the year 1950-51, the total expenditure on research and develop¬
ment had increased by between 50 and 100 per cent since 1945-46, and the number
of qualified staff by about 50 per cent. The other figures remained substantially the
same.
Research Associations
One of the first acts of the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
(see pp. 343 and 344), when it was established in 1915, was to recommend a scheme
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
342
by which the Government associated itself with groups of firms having similar
interests to form Research Associations. Today there are 42 such Research Associa¬
tions,1 with a combined income of £4 million of which about one-third is contri¬
buted by the Government through the Industrial Grants Committee of the Depart¬
ment of Scientific and Industrial Research (see pp. 344-5). The amounts of the
Government grants are related to the contributions made by the industries
concerned.
The Research Associations are autonomous bodies, governed by their own
councils, the large majority of whose members are representatives of industry. The
councils are advised by research committees in the preparation of research
programmes.
Sponsored Research Institutes. A number of sponsored research institutes have
been established to meet the needs of private firms which are unable to maintain
fully equipped research laboratories. They are establishments where research
can be carried out confidentially so that the results and any patents which may
arise from it are retained as the property of the sponsoring body. Examples of
such institutes are the Fulmer Research Institute and the Sondes Place Research
Institute.
National Research Development Corporation. The National Research Develop¬
ment Corporation (NRDC) was set up by the Board of Trade in 1948. Its function
is primarily to develop in the public interest, inventions resulting from research
carried out by Government Departments and other public bodies. Under the
Development of Inventions Act, 1954, however, NRDC is now allowed, under
certain conditions, to initiate research as well as to develop inventions resulting
from research. It is an independent body, subject only to general direction by
the Board of Trade, with powers to borrow from Government funds up to £5 million
in the first ten years of its life. Projects selected for development include electronic
digital computers, Merton diffraction gratings, a lightweight power unit, and the
production of hecogenin for the manufacture of cortisone.
GOVERNMENT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION
Early Developments
Although the active participation by the Government in scientific effort is, for the
most part, a twentieth-century development, its association with science dates from
a much earlier time. Interest in navigation led Charles II in 1675 to establish
Britain’s first State-supported institution—the Royal Observatory at Greenwich2—
for the purpose of correcting the tables of the positions of the moon and fixed stars
‘for the use of his seamen’. The Geological Survey of Great Britain the first
national institution of its kind in the world—originated in 1835. In 1842 the
Department of the Government Chemist was founded, and in 1854 ‘for the safe¬
guarding of seamen’ the Meteorological Office was established by the Board of
Trade. All these Government Departments were using scientific knowledge but
there was little organized effort towards the application of the discoveries made in
pure science. Government scientific organization, like many British institutions,
evolved gradually in response to the changing social and economic circumstances of
the times.
The need for research in physics and engineering, and particularly into methods

of precise measurement, led to the establishment of the National Physical Labora¬
tory under the control of the Royal Society in 1900, with a modest grant from the
Treasury towards equipment and a yearly grant towards upkeep.
From 1909, however, the Government assumed a wider responsibility for pro¬
moting and encouraging scientific research and since that time its assistance has
been adapted to meet the rapidly changing conditions in industry and education.
The Development Commission, appointed in 1909 by the Government, recom¬
mended that financial aid should be made available from the Development Fund to
‘aid and develop agriculture and rural industries by promoting scientific research’.
In 1911 the Development Fund was used to establish a comprehensive scheme which
led to the formation of most of the present-day agricultural research institutes.
In 1913 a Medical Research Committee (the forerunner of the Medical Research
Council) was appointed to administer the research funds provided under the
National Health Insurance Act of 1911.
Up to the outbreak of the first world war, the Government’s contribution to
scientific research was made directly through such organizations as these, and
indirectly through grants administered on its behalf by such bodies as the Royal
Society and the Imperial College of Science and Technology.
The recognition of the importance of scientific research and of the application of
scientific knowledge to commerce and industry led to the establishment of the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) as a separate Govern¬
ment Department in 1916 (see pp. 49 and 344-5). The Advisory Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, to which all proposals for new work are referred
by the DSIR in the first instance, was given responsibility for (1) instituting specific
researches; (2) establishing or developing special institutions or departments of
existing institutions for the specific study of problems affecting particular industries
or trades; (3) the establishment and award of research studentships and fellowships.
In 1918 financial responsibility for the National Physical Laboratory was trans¬
ferred from the Royal Society to the DSIR, although the Royal Society continued
to advise on the scientific direction of the Laboratory.
The Forestry Commissioners were appointed in 1919 with powers to undertake
and aid research for the promotion of forestry.
In 1920 the Government established the Medical Research Council with a grant
in aid provided directly by Parliament.
The third of the Councils created by the Government for the promotion of
research, the Agricultural Research Council, was established in 1931. In addition to
its duties as adviser to the Development Commissioners and the Agricultural
Departments (for England and Wales and for Scotland), the Council was given
funds of its own from which grants could be made for special research projects.
During the second world war a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War
Cabinet was created, with the object of co-ordinating defence research and civil
research.
The Lord President of the Council, as the Minister responsible for the three
Research Councils, and as President of the Scientific Advisory Committee, came to
be regarded as the member of the Cabinet responsible for the direction of Govern¬
ment scientific organization.
Post-war Developments
At the end of the second world war, the Government established an Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy ‘to advise the Lord President of the Council in the
exercise of his responsibility for the formulation and execution of Government
scientific policy’.
z
344
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Advisory Council, appointed by the Lord President in January 1947, has 15
members—12 eminent scientists from the universities, industry and Government
service, and 3 senior Government administrators.
In the same year the Defence Research Policy Committee was established ‘to
advise the Minister of Defence and Chiefs of Staff on matters connected with the
formulation of scientific policy in the defence field’.
These two bodies replaced the Scientific Advisory Committee to the War
Cabinet.
In order to give adequate attention to each of the subjects within its wide range
of interest, the Advisory Council has established the following standing committees:
The Committee on Scientific Manpower
The Scientific Library and Technical Information Committee
The Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations.
Government Machinery for Civil Scientific Research
The principles underlying Government scientific organization are briefly as
follows:
1. The Lord President of the Council is responsible for the formulation and
execution of Government scientific policy and is advised by the Advisory
Council on Scientific Policy on general questions which relate to the whole
field of civil science.
2. The Lord President is the Minister responsible to Parliament for the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Medical Research
Council, the Agricultural Research Council, and the Nature Conservancy,
and is chairman of the three Privy Council Committees to which they report
—the committees for Scientific and Industrial Research, Medical Research,
and Agricultural Research and Nature Conservation.
3. The Lord President is also the Minister responsible to Parliament for
general oversight of the development of atomic energy, and appoints the
members of the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 348).
4. Other Ministers are responsible for the scientific establishments within their
own Departments.
5. The advice of the Research Councils is at the disposal of the Executive
Departments and there is close liaison between them, but the Research
Councils are not subject to departmental control.
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
The DSIR1 is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research of which the Lord President is chairman. This Committee
is advised by the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (see
pp. 341-2 and 343), which includes in its membership eminent scientists and lead¬
ing industrialists, two members closely connected with organized labour and
assessors appointed by Government Departments.
With the exception of medicine, agriculture and atomic energy, the DSIR
includes in its scope all branches of natural science and their application to industrial
processes. Its activities fall into three main groups:
1. Scientific research in the national interest and to meet the needs of Govern¬
ment Departments.
1 See also p. 49.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS 345
2. The encouragement of research and the application of scientific knowledge
in industry.
3. The encouragement of fundamental research at universities and elsewhere,
and the maintenance of an adequate supply of trained research workers for
laboratories of all kinds.
The first of these functions is discharged through 13 national research organiza¬
tions1 under the Department’s own control and direction and financed from its
own Vote, and one, the Fire Research Organization, which is maintained by the
Department and the Fire Offices Committee jointly.
The National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, Middlesex, is the largest of the
DSIR establishments and conducts research in a variety of branches of physics.
These include aerodynamics; electricity; electronics; X-ray, ultra-violet, visible
and infra-red radiations; mathematical computation; metallurgy; heat and
temperature measurement; sound and noise; and ship design. The Laboratory also
maintains the British primary standards of length, mass, temperature, illumination,
electrical and other physical units. The facilities for accurate measurement are also
employed for precision work and determination of the physical properties of
materials. The Laboratory carries out high-grade testing of a wide range of
apparatus and materials.
The second of the DSIR’s functions is discharged mainly through the autono¬
mous Research Associations (see p. 342); while its third function is carried out by
means of grants to individual workers or institutions for special investigations.
The close contacts maintained between the DSIR and other Government
Departments, Research Associations and other bodies help to ensure that the
scientific resources of the Department are applied to the solution of problems which
are of most importance to the national economy and are used to make the maximum
contribution to improving industrial efficiency.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council (MRC), the successor of the Medical Research
Committee (see p. 343), was incorporated under its present title by Royal Charter
in 1920.
The MRC is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Medical
Research of which the Lord President is chairman, the Minister of Health is vice-
chairman, and the Secretaries of State for the Home Department, Scotland,
Commonwealth Relations, and the Colonies are members.
The MRC has 12 members. Nine of these members are appointed for their
scientific qualifications; and of the other three, one must be a member of the House
of Lords and one a member of the House of Commons. The scientific members are
appointed by the Privy Council Committee after consultation with the Medical
Research Council and the President of the Royal Society.

The Council’s chief function is to undertake or promote scientific investigations
to obtain new knowledge likely to be of value in the field of curative and preventive
medicine. In promoting investigations on particular subjects it has the advice of a
large number of expert technical committees which it appoints for the purpose. In
general, the arrangements for the support of research fall under three headings:
1. Investigations by members of the Council’s scientific staff, mostly working
in the Council’s own research establishments.
2. Temporary research grants to independent investigators in universities and
elsewhere.
3. Research studentships and travelling fellowships.
The Council’s principal research establishment is the National Institute for
Medical Research, at Mill Hill, London. In addition, the Council maintains
some 50 research units, departments or groups attached to university or hospital
institutions; some of these are concerned with clinical research and others with
laboratory studies.1
The Public Health Laboratory Service is administered by the MRC on behalf of
the Ministry of Health. It consists of a chain of public health laboratories through¬
out England and Wales, the largest establishment of the Service being the Central
Public Health Laboratory, Colindale (London). This laboratory includes the
National Collection of Type Cultures, the Standards Laboratory for Serological
Reagents, and reference laboratories specializing in the identification of particular
groups of infective micro-organisms, as well as other specialized laboratories such
as the Air Hygiene and Food Hygiene Laboratories.
Agricultural Research Council
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) was established by Royal Charter in
1931. It is responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural
Research and Nature Conservation, of which the Lord President of the Council is

other members of the Committee are the Secretaries of State for the Home Depart¬
ment, Scotland, and the Colonies, and the Ministers of Education and Housing and
Local Government.
The ARC consists of 15 members, five appointed for their general experience
of, and interest in, agriculture, and the rest for their scientific qualifications. The
Privy Council Committee, after consulting the ARC itself and (as regards the
scientific members) the President of the Royal Society, makes the appointments.
The Council plans and co-ordinates work over the entire field of agricultural
research and is assisted in this task by standing committees and a number of
technical committees and conferences.
The Council advises both the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the
Department of Agriculture for Scotland on the programmes, estimates and staffing
of the Agricultural Research Institutes1, which with certain exceptions have their

own governing bodies but are almost wholly financed from State funds by means
of annual block grants from the Agricultural Departments. The Council has 14
research stations and units under its direct control in Great Britain.1
In addition the ARC devotes part of its funds to encouraging research by means
of special research grants which are allocated to one or other of the research insti¬
tutes, to university departments or to advisory centres. It also awards scholarships
and training grants.
Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy was established by Royal Charter in 1949 and is
responsible to the Committee of the Privy Council for Agricultural Research and
Nature Conservation. Its functions, as summarized in the charter, are ‘to provide
scientific advice on the conservation and control of the natural flora and fauna of
Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature reserves in Great Britain
(see p. 332), including the maintenance of physical features of scientific interest;
and to organize and develop the research and scientific service related thereto*.
Atomic Energy Authority
From 1946 to 1953 responsibility for atomic energy research and development
rested with the Minister of Supply. By April 1953, however, the Government
had decided in principle to transfer responsibility for atomic energy from the
Minister of Supply to a non-departmental organization, in view both of the growing
importance of the industrial applications of atomic energy and the need for an
organization for atomic energy more akin to that of a large industrial undertaking.
It was subsequently announced that the Minister to be generally responsible for
the control and development of atomic energy in the United Kingdom would be
the Lord President of the Council.
As an interim measure the Department of Atomic Energy was set up under
the Lord President; this Department took over responsibility for the operation of
the atomic energy project from 1st January 1954. Subsequently Parliament passed
the Atomic Energy Authority Act, 1954, and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority, set up under that Act, took over responsibility for the project from the
Department of Atomic Energy on 1st August 1954. The Lord President is still
responsible to Parliament for atomic energy policy generally and also, subject to the
consent of the Treasury, for providing funds for the Authority out of money provided
by Parliament. In particular he has the duty of securing that, in the Authority’s
operations, the proper degrees of importance are attached to the various applica¬
tions of atomic energy. He is assisted, in the exercise of these responsibilities,
by the Atomic Energy Office, which also provides any necessary liaison between

the Authority and other Government Departments. The Minister of Supply
continues to be responsible for providing atomic weapons to the Services and places
contracts with the Authority for the production of nuclear components of such
weapons and research related to them; the Authority is free to conduct experi¬
mental work which may lead to improved types of warheads for such weapons.
The Authority, whose members are appointed by the Lord President, consists of
not less than eight and not more than 11 members. Eight members, three of whom
are serving on a part-time basis, were originally appointed.
The Authority, like other statutory corporations, is free from day-to-day
Government control (subject to the power given to the Lord President to issue
directions to the Authority on any matter where he considers over-riding national
interests require his intervention), but differs from them in that the bulk of its
revenue is derived from money voted by Parliament and in that its accounts are
examined and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General (see p. 248).
The Authority’s establishments, and their respective functions, are as follows:
The Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, in Berkshire, is respon¬
sible for fundamental research into nuclear physics and atomic energy, and pro¬
vides basic scientific information to the other establishments. It houses the United
Kingdom’s first two experimental piles, deep and Bepo, a new zero energy experi¬
mental fast reactor, Zephyr, which went into operation on 5th February 1954, and a
new heavy water reactor known as Dimple, which started working on 1st Augusti954.
An Isotope School was established at Harwell in April 1951 (see p. 185) and a
Reactor School in September 1954. The first gives training in the handling and
measuring of radioisotopes, and the second provides courses in reactor physics
and reactor engineering as well as in nuclear physics and metallurgy.
The Radiochemical Centre at Amersham, in Buckinghamshire, is a dependency
of the Harwell Establishment. It is concerned with preparing radio-active sub¬
stances such as radium, radon and radioactive isotopes produced in the atomic piles.
These are used for medical, scientific and industrial purposes.
The production of fissile material is directed from the headquarters of the
Industrial Group at Risley, near Warrington, Lancashire. Production factories are
situated at Springfields, near Preston, Lancashire, where pure uranium is produced
from uranium concentrates; at Windscale in Cumberland, where plutonium is
produced from uranium by means of atomic piles; at Capenhurst in Cheshire,
where there is a gaseous diffusion plant for separating the uranium isotope U235
from the more abundant isotope U238, thus providing a fissile material which can
be used as an alternative to plutonium. The Industrial Group is also responsible
for the design, construction and operation of the experimental atomic power plant
that is being built at Calder Hall, adjoining the Windscale factory, and for the experi¬
mental breeder reactor to be built at Dounreay, in Caithness, Scotland.
Research work on atomic weapons is carried on at the Establishment at Alder-
maston, in Berkshire, and its out-stations at Woolwich and Fort Halstead.
The work of these establishments is co-ordinated at the headquarters of the
Atomic Energy Authority in London.
Other Government-sponsored Scientific Research
All Departments rely on one or other of the Government Research Councils for
scientific advice. While some use these bodies as their main source of scientific
information, a few have set up supplementary research organizations of their own.
Defence Research with Civil Applications
Research and development undertaken by the Admiralty is almost exclusively
directed to meeting the requirements of the Royal Navy, but a substantial amount
350
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of this work has important civil applications. The research activities of the Royal
Observatory and the National Institute of Oceanography, which are mainly in the
civil field, are administered by the Admiralty.
The Ministry of Supply carries out research needed to meet the technical
requirements of defence and is also responsible for research in some civilian fields,
e.g., the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas Turbine Establishment
at Farnborough. Some fundamental research is also carried out for the Ministry by
universities and industrial organizations.
The Air Ministry is responsible for the Meteorological Office (see p. 40), where
the research carried out has many applications on the civil side.
Agriculture
Apart from research at the grant-aided Institutes and the centres financed by the
Agricultural Research Council, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries conducts
research in its own Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and also at its
Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Herts; and its Infestation Division at
Tolworth, Surrey, conducts research into problems affecting the destruction and
control of insect pests of stored food, rodent pests and other animal and bird pests.
The Department of Agriculture for Scotland maintains a plant pathology laboratory
in Edinburgh (carrying out research in entomology and helminthology). In
Northern Ireland research in all the major agricultural sciences is carried out
directly by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Fisheries
The authorities concerned with fisheries research are the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries, which maintains a laboratory for marine research, a number of
research vessels, and an experimental station for shellfish investigation; the
Scottish Home Department, which maintains a research laboratory at Aberdeen
and four research ships; and the Development Commissioners.
The Development Commissioners, through their Advisory Committee on
Fishery Research, co-ordinate all fishery research, not only that which is aided by
the Development Fund (see p. 343). The latter bears a large part of the cost of
fishery investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and fishery
research in Scotland. From it a number of independent institutions receive grants
for marine and freshwater research.1

The Ministry of Food (see p. 42), under the direction of its Chief Scientific
Adviser, conducts research in nutrition and food technology. It has experimental
laboratories and kitchens in London and has established an experimental factory at
Aberdeen to facilitate the commercial development and application of the results of
research.
Forestry
The Forestry Commission2 is responsible for forestry in Great Britain and
undertakes experimental work relating to silvicultural and allied problems. By

means of grants, it also aids forest research work undertaken by various universities
and by the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford.
Fuel and Power
The Ministry of Fuel and Power has responsibility for research on safety in mines,
and plays a direct part in research such as that into the development of coal¬
consuming gas turbines, underground gasification and total gasification. There is
close collaboration between the Ministry, the Scientific Departments of the
National Coal Board, the British Electricity Authority, the Gas Council, and the
Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, all
of which are responsible for research in their own fields.
Transport
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation is concerned with two main fields
of scientific research: research on radio aids to marine navigation, conducted by the
Admiralty Signal and Radar Establishment, the cost being borne by the Ministry
of Transport and Civil Aviation; and road research, in co-operation with the DSIR,
including soil mechanics, materials, construction and road safety.
Land Use and Planning
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is responsible for policy relat¬
ing to the use and development of land in England and Wales. Through its
Technical Services Directorate, the Ministry deals with technical planning and
geographical, geological economic and sociological matters. Similar arrangements
are made for Scotland by the Department of Health for Scotland. The Ministry
of Health and Local Government is responsible for the general administration
of the planning legislation in Northern Ireland.
Building
The Ministry of Works is responsible for reviewing the whole field of research
and technical development of the building industry and for ensuring that the results
of research are made available to the industry. Research is carried out by the
Building Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
Radio and Telecommunications
The Post Office undertakes scientific research on a wide range of subjects relating
to telephone, telegraph and radio systems which is carried out by the Research
Branch of the Engineering Department. It also undertakes the experimental
development of radio transmitters and receivers for Post Office services and other
Government Departments. The Post Office keeps in close touch with the BBC in
connection with the development of broadcasting techniques for both sound and
vision.
Analytical Chemistry
The Department of the Government Chemist is responsible for providing
analytical services to all Government Departments that may require them. It
carries out special investigations, e.g., in connection with nutritional and physio¬
logical surveys, and conducts fundamental research in infra-red spectrography,
chromatography and X-ray study of crystals.
Medicine and Health
The Ministry of Health is responsible for conducting and promoting research
into the cause, prevention and treatment of illness. It controls the Public Health
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
352
Laboratory Service, which is administered for the Ministry by the Medical
Research Council (see pp. 345-6).
The Department of Health for Scotland has similar responsibilities, and an
Advisory Committee on Medical Research in Scotland works with the Medical
Research Council.
In Northern Ireland, the Hospitals Authority (a statutory body set up by the
Minister of Health and Local Government) has permissive powers to conduct or
assist medical research. In addition, it has a statutory duty to provide adequate
bacteriological and pathological services.
The General Register Office carries out research in four main fields: (1) analysis
and interpretation of statistics of causes of death; (2) statistical inquiry into the
treatment of cancer and its results; (3) morbidity as revealed in hospital statistics;
and (4) mental health.
Colonial Research
The bulk of the research work relating to Colonial development is done locally,
but much of it requires close collaboration with research institutes and laboratories
in Britain. It is the function of the Colonial Research Council to co-ordinate the
work of the specialist committees and to advise on general questions relating to
policy.
The Colonial Products Research Council was set up by the Colonial Office in
1943 for the organization of research under its own director. It initiates schemes of
research in Colonial raw materials, such as sugar, timber, and mineral oils.
Anti-Locust Research
In 1931 a small locust research organization at the Imperial Institute of Ento¬
mology in London was internationally adopted as the world centre for locust
research. This organization, later known as the Anti-Locust Research Centre, has
during the past twenty years received and co-ordinated information on locust move¬
ments and breeding from 40 countries, undertaken scientific research into the life-
history and habits of the different species, and investigated and developed methods
for their control and destruction. One half of the expenditure on control is con¬
tributed by the member countries of the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom
itself contributing one third.
Other Research Work
Finally there are a number of scientific institutions administered by Government
Departments which undertake a certain amount of research work in addition to
their other scientific activities. These include the Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew)
and the Ordnance Survey Department.
Scientific Museums
The British Museum (Natural History)—an independent section of the British
Museum—contains one of the world’s largest collections of natural history material
and is recognized as a leading research institution.
The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science
in all countries, but chiefly in Great Britain which has always held a leading place
in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and every kind of
industrial machinery and process, all of which are represented in the Museum’s
collections. The geology of Britain is known in more exact detail than that of any
other country in the world, and the Geological Survey, responsible for this work,
also has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological Museum. These
three museums are in South Kensington, London.

Parliamentary and Scientific Committee
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded at the end of 1939 by
members of the House of Commons and replaced the former Parliamentary Science
Committee. It is one of a number of informal, unofficial, all-party Parliamentary
groups, which have grown up spontaneously and have a varying degree of influence
(see p. 30). Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party and in
both Houses, and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making
scientific and technological organizations in Britain as may be affiliated under its
constitution. Membership in 1953 comprised 163 members of Parliament and
representatives of 85 scientific and technological institutions. The aims and objects
of the committee are:
1. To provide members of Parliament with authoritative scientific information
from time to time in connection with debates.
2. To bring to the notice of members of Parliament and Government Depart¬
ments the results of scientific research and technical development which
bear upon questions of current public interest.
3. To arrange for suitable action through parliamentary channels whenever
necessary to ensure that proper regard is had for the scientific point of view.
4. To examine all relevant legislation and to take such action as may be
suitable.
5. To watch the financing of scientific research.
6. To provide its members and other approved subscribers with a regular
summary of scientific matters dealt with in Parliament.
Broadly speaking the activities of the committee may be divided under two
headings. First it provides, as far as possible, for a regular exchange of information
between members of Parliament and scientists; secondly, it endeavours to ensure
that action is taken to right matters seen to be wrong in the light of such information.
Scientific Liaison Overseas
The history of scientific progress is essentially a story involving many nations,
and the organization of a country’s scientific research would be incomplete without
provision for adequate liaison with other countries.
Before the second world war a vast amount of international scientific collabora¬
tion took place through the exchange of university staffs, the awards of scholarships
and fellowships, the close relations existing between the learned societies in this
country and their equivalent bodies abroad, and through international conferences
and congresses.
The war and the post-war period saw the emergence of a number of new develop¬
ments in oversea scientific collaboration which reflected the Government’s recogni¬
tion of its responsibility in the whole field of science. The result has been that
today there now exist a number of official channels through which scientific liaison
can be conducted; these include:
1. The British Commonwealth Scientific Offices. A feature of the war-time pattern
of scientific collaboration was the establishment of Scientific Missions, in London
by the United States and the Commonwealth countries, and in Washington by the
United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth countries; the latter subsequently
joined together as the British Commonwealth Scientific Office in Washington.
Immediately after the war a British Commonwealth official Scientific Conference
was held in London, and in view of the success of the office in Washington during
the war period, it was recommended that this office be continued in peace time, and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
354
in addition that a British Scientific Office be set up in London. These recommenda¬
tions were approved by all Commonwealth Governments. Since 1948 the Scientific
Offices in London of the Commonwealth countries have been located in the same
building, and are closely associated with the Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR.
2. The Standing Committee on Overseas Scientific Relations. This committee of
the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy was set up after the war to provide, among
other things, for discussion of general policy on oversea scientific representation,
scientific relations with Commonwealth and foreign countries, and scientific aspects
of the work of the United Nations.
3. The Overseas Liaison Division of the DSIR. This division is responsible for the
executive work arising from the Standing Committee’s activities. It is regarded as
the general inter-departmental body responsible for oversea scientific liaison, and
is placed within the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for con¬
venience of organization.
4. Commomvealth Agricultural Bureaux. Machinery exists in the Commonwealth
Agricultural Bureaux for liaison in the field of agricultural science between
countries of the Commonwealth. In the United Kingdom there are 10 Bureaux,
specializing in various branches of agricultural science, and two Institutes—the
Commonwealth Mycological Institute and the Commonwealth Institute of Ento¬
mology. A third Institute, the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, has
its headquarters in Ottawa, Canada. The Bureaux collect, collate and disseminate
information resulting from agricultural research.
5. The British Council. The aims of the British Council in the pure and applied
sciences are to foster closer co-operation between British scientists and scientists of
other countries, and to promote a better understanding of Britain among oversea
specialists by disseminating a knowledge of British activities and achievements.
Under the first objective the exchange of visits between scientists in the United
Kingdom and other countries is of prime importance. Besides arranging lecture or
advisory tours overseas by eminent British scientists, the British Council, among
many activities of a similar nature, brings to the United Kingdom every year a
number of senior oversea specialists, postgraduate students and technicians on
visits of varying duration, for the purpose of study in British universities and other
institutions, or for discussion with their counterparts in Britain. In addition to
publishing the British Agricultural Bulletin and British Medical Bidletin, both
intended primarily to keep oversea specialists informed of progress in Britain, the
Council maintains a considerable and much used specialist information service. In
the 60 countries in which the British Council is represented, libraries are main¬
tained and in many instances these have strong sections of scientific and techno¬
logical literature.
The British Council maintains at its headquarters specialist departments for
medicine and science (including agriculture and engineering), while in some
countries scientists are attached to its oversea representatives. The Council is
advised by eminent scientists who serve on its Science Advisory Committee and
specialist panels for the different subjects.
Government Expenditure on Research
Central government funds to a total of over £198 million for scientific research
and development were voted for the financial year i954_55- Besides civil estimates
of £180 million, this sum included1 £15-2 million in respect of Navy Estimates

355
and £315,000 in respect of Air Estimates. Included in the Civil Estimates were:
Ministry of Supply, £163-6 million; DSIR, £7 million; Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries, £43°>i3°; Medical Research Council, £1-9 million; Development
and Welfare (Colonies), £1-3 million; Agricultural Research Council and Nature
Conservancy, £1-4 million.
In addition to the above figures, over £50 million has been voted to the Lord
President to enable the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 348) to carry out research
into, and the development of, atomic energy.
Science Centre
An important decision to bring together learned scientific societies and Govern¬
ment research agencies in a ‘Science Centre’ was announced by the Labour
Government in 1950, and confirmed by the Conservative Government in June
1952. The Centre is to be built on the South Bank of the Thames immediately
below Waterloo Bridge on a site purchased by the London County Council for
the purpose. It is intended to improve facilities and contacts between scientists
and users of science, both nationally and internationally.
THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Various institutions are concerned either wholly or in part with the preservation
of Britain’s cultural heritage and the promotion of literature and the arts. There is
no Ministry of Fine Arts or equivalent organization to formulate or administer
policy in the arts, though bodies such as the Standing Commission on Museums
and Galleries (appointed 1931) and the Royal Fine Art Commission (appointed
1924) act in an advisory capacity. Government interest in the arts is expressed
mainly through the provision of grants to such bodies as the Arts Council, the
British Council, the British Film Institute,1 and the Council of Industrial Design,2
and also to the National Museums and Art Galleries (see p. 361). In addition, under
the Local Government Act, 1948, local authorities may now use part of the revenue
from the rates for the encouragement of the arts. Local education authorities also
make grants to some Schools of Art, Music and Drama.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter in 1946.
It consists of not more than 16 honorary members appointed by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in consultation with the Minister of Education and the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Its main duties are to increase the accessibility of the fine arts to
the public, to improve the standard of execution of the fine arts, and to advise and
to co-operate with Government Departments, local authorities and other organiza¬
tions on any matter connected directly or indirectly with these objects.3
The British Council exists to promote overseas a wider knowledge of the United
Kingdom and the English language and to develop closer cultural relations with
other countries. It was founded in 1934 and was granted a Royal Charter in 1940.
Nine of the 30 members of its Executive Committee are nominated by Government
Departments; it is financed almost entirely from public funds, mainly through the
Foreign Office. In the Commonwealth it acts directly as the agent of the Common¬
wealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office. It is usually designated as the
Government’s principal instrument for the implementation of cultural conventions
to which the United Kingdom is a party.

364 and 365.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
356
The Council maintains staffs who, in about 60 oversea countries, foster English
studies, provide regular information on British life and thought and promote know¬
ledge of the scientific, artistic and other developments and achievements of the
United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom itself, the Council arranges study programmes for
scholars and teachers from overseas, and other professional visitors. It also provides
a wide range of services for students from overseas (particularly those from the
Colonies) who are studying in United Kingdom universities and other educational
institutions.1
Unofficial institutions concerned with the promotion of the arts include many
charitable trusts and foundations, e.g., the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust and
the Pilgrim Trust, and a large number of societies, associations and other organiza¬
tions concerned with separate aspects of the arts, some of which are mentioned
later in this chapter.
The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust was founded in 1913 by the late Andrew
Carnegie. It was incorporated under Royal Charter in 1917- The Trust, which was
initially founded for ‘the improvement of the well-being of the masses of the people
of Great Britain and Ireland’, consists of 25 life trustees, 6 trustees nominated by
the Corporation of Dunfermline and 3 trustees nominated by the Fife County
Council. Its cultural activities include assisting projects relating to music, drama,
the visual arts and museums. Grants totalling approximately £27,124 were made
for these purposes during the year ended 31st December, 1953.
The Pilgrim Trust was founded in 1930 by the late Edward Stephen Harkness, an
American citizen. The Trust, which consists of 8 trustees, is now devoted to ‘the
preservation of the national heritage of beauty and history and to the advancement
of learning and the arts’. Grants made for this last purpose during the year ended
31st December 1953 totalled approximately £16,186.
DRAMA
State patronage of the drama is expressed through the media of {a) the Arts
Council, which grants subsidies to certain theatrical managements operating on a
non-profit-making basis (i.e. using profits to finance future productions), provided
that such managements have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently
high standards of practical competence, (6) the Customs and Excise Department,
which has power to grant remission of entertainment tax to certain managements,
chosen on the same principles as those applied by the Arts Council, and (c) the
British Council, which is responsible for making the British theatre better known
abroad by organizing and sponsoring international tours by important companies,
including the Old Vic Theatre Company and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre
Company, and by sending overseas exhibitions of theatrical design and lecturers on
drama.
Moreover, the Treasury is empowered, under the National Theatre Act, I949>
to support the Shakespeare Memorial Trust National Theatre Scheme by con¬
tributing £1 million to the cost of building and equipping a national theatre, which
will operate under public auspices.
Professional Theatre
The centre of the professional theatre is in London, where there are some fifty
principal theatres and a number of suburban and ‘little’ theatres, which are let
to producing managements on a commercial basis for every type of theatrical
1 For further information on the work of the British Council see pp. 354, 359, 362
and 365.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
357
entertainment. There are also theatres in Scotland, Northern Ireland and in the
provinces of England and Wales, which are served by productions touring either
before or after London presentation, by companies specially formed for touring,
and by local repertory companies. No new theatres have been built in the United
Kingdom since the end of the second world war, but several damaged ones have been
reconstructed, some have been converted from other uses and, in Coventry, a plan
for the building of a new theatre has recently been announced by the City Council.
In addition to managements which rent theatres for limited or long runs, there
are a few producing organizations which possess theatres of their own. Among the
older and better known of these organizations are the Old Vic Theatre Company in
London and the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in Stratford on Avon,
both of which are permanent companies presenting their plays in true repertory.
Local repertory companies (some of which are assisted financially and otherwise by
the Arts Council) may have the use of their own established repertory theatres, e.g.,
the Bristol Old Vic Company at the historic Theatre Royal in Bristol, or they may
tour the various towns and villages in the locality, playing from one to several nights
in each place and using any building which can be made suitable for the purpose.
Inevitably, the work of repertory companies varies in quality but, generally speak¬
ing, the standard of both production and acting is high; many of the leading
dramatists, producers and actors in the United Kingdom started their careers with
companies of this kind.
Both in London and in the provinces, most managers and artists are members of
one or another of the professional organizations which exist to maintain the stan¬
dards of the professional theatre, to regulate the industry and to promote and safe¬
guard the welfare of those who work in it. Organizations of this kind include the
London Theatre Council, the Provincial Theatre Council, the Society of West
End Managers, the Theatrical Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory
Theatres, British Actors’ Equity (the actors’ trade union), and the League of
Dramatists. The trade union of theatre staffs is the National Association of
Theatrical and Kine Employees.
Amateur Theatre
The amateur dramatic movement is widespread throughout the United Kingdom;
there are known to be at least 33,000 amateur dramatic societies in existence. The
movement is sponsored and fostered by local education authorities, by other public
bodies, and by three special organizations—the British Drama League, the Standing
Conference of Drama Associations which is supported by the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust and the Department of Education in Scotland, and the Scottish
Community Drama Association.
The British Drama League, which was founded in 1919, operates on a basis of
affiliation and individual membership. Its many services to its members include
organizing courses, lectures and competitions in dramatic work; running an
information bureau; and giving advice on many matters connected with the stage,
e.g., play-writing, production, stage management and the organization of drama
festivals. The work of the Standing Conference is mainly that of co-ordination
between the various bodies concerned in the amateur dramatic movement; while
the Scottish Community Drama Association fulfils, in Scotland, the functions of
both the League and the Conference.
Dramatic Training
Dramatic training is at present provided mainly in the large number of dramatic
schools and institutions of all kinds which have been established throughout the
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
358
United Kingdom. Among the most important of such institutions are the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art (which was founded in 1904 and is now grant-aided, and
which provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the Central School
of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, and the Webber-Douglas School, all three
of which are in London; and the Old Vic School in Bristol.
Some form of education in drama is also provided in many of the general schools
and in the youth clubs of Britain; and a varying degree of recognition is given to
the subject in the universities. Bristol University leads in this field, in that it has
created a Department of Drama offering a course which an Arts student may take
as part of his or her general degree. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge
have famous dramatic societies, and there are drama clubs and societies in many
other universities and colleges.
FILMS
The first cinematograph exhibition in Britain was given in 1896; and within ten
years Britain was in the forefront of film production. This early ascendancy did not
survive the impact of the first world war, and since 1914 British films have had to
contend with keen and increasing American competition. Legislation, first intro¬
duced in 1927 and continued by the Cinematograph Films Acts of 1938 and 1948,
has given some assistance by means of the quota system, under which a certain
proportion of British films must be shown in British cinemas each year. The pro¬
portion is fixed annually by Board of Trade Order after consultation with the
Cinematograph Films Council and is subject to confirmation by Parliament.
During the second world war the British cinema re-emerged with new vitality
and began again to exert an important influence on film development by the pro¬
duction of many notable feature films depicting Britain’s ordeals and achievements
in the war. These films were based on the documentary technique which had been
developed since 1929 for the making of factual informative films sponsored by the
Government or by commercial organizations. British feature films in the post-war
years have been influenced by this trend, and realistic treatment is now a charac¬
teristic of British feature production, both in dramatic films and in the light-hearted
satirical comedies that have won acclaim in recent years. British film makers are
now also turning their attention to the potentialities of three-dimensional and wide¬
screen feature production.
The art of film production is a costly one which depends upon a commercially
prosperous industry for its development and well-being, and needs adequate
financial backing combined with freedom for the film maker to experiment and to
express his own ideas. There is no State-owned feature production unit in Britain,
but the National Film Finance Corporation is empowered to lend money for film
production. The Corporation was established for a period of five years under the
Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Act, 1949. In 1954 another Act
extended its life for a further three years. Its members—a chairman, a managing
director, and three to five others—are appointed by the Board of Trade. Its funds
(limited by statute to £8 million) are provided, up to £6 million, by advances from
the Board of Trade; the remaining £2 million may be borrowed from non-
Governmental sources. The Corporation is solely concerned with finance and has
no brief to influence the content of the film.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film Institute
which is financed by Exchequer grants, administers the National Film Library and
is responsible for the National Film Theatre, where programmes of experimental,
scientific and documentary films, as well as ‘classic features’, are shown regularly.

Britain varies with the financial state of the film industry. In 1954 there were 32
feature production companies belonging to the British Film Producers’ Association,
51 short film or specialized film producers belonging to the Association of Specialized
Film Producers, and 4,566 cinemas. About one half of these cinemas have increased
the size of their screens in the past year though not many have yet adopted the
extreme ratio of Cinemascope. One cinema in London has been equipped for
Cinerama.
FINE ARTS
The fine arts of painting and sculpture in Britain receive indirect State support
through the Arts Council and the British Council, and considerable public support
through the many art institutions (including schools and colleges of art and exhibit¬
ing societies) and the art galleries and museums of the United Kingdom. There are
at present a number of British painters and sculptors of international repute as well
as younger artists of great promise; and interest in their work and that of their
contemporaries overseas, as well as in that of British and foreign artists of the past,
is most marked in all sections of the community. In the year April 1953 to the end
of March 1954 the Arts Council organized 100 separate art exhibitions in Great
Britain; over 400 showings of these exhibitions were given in more than 200
different places.
Art Institutions
There are 13 colleges of art in the United Kingdom, each of which serves
a region; and there are schools of art in nearly all of the larger towns. In London,
the most notable of these schools and colleges are the Slade School of painting,
drawing and sculpture, the Central School of Arts and Crafts, the Royal Academy
Schools, and the Royal College of Art which specializes in industrial design.
Industrial design is also the concern of (a) the Council of Industrial Design, a
State-sponsored organization (consisting of 22 members, including a chairman
appointed by the President of the Board of Trade), which was founded in 1946 to
encourage well-designed manufactures, and (b) the Royal Society of Arts, which
was founded in 1754 ‘for the encouragement of arts, manufactures and commerce’
(see p. 340). The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the
history of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, and the
Warburg Institute (also a part of London University) which provides facilities for
research on the character and history of the classical tradition.
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy, which,
in summer, holds exhibitions of works by members and non-members, and in
winter, a series of exhibitions devoted to national schools of painting; the Institute
of Contemporary Arts; the Royal Society of British Artists; the Royal Institute of
Oil Painters; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours; the Royal Society of
Portrait Painters; and the London Group. ’There are also an increasing number
of amateur art societies throughout the United Kingdom which hold local exhibi¬
tions and encourage local interest in the fine arts in a variety of ways.
Knowledge of British fine arts overseas is fostered by the British Council by
means of exhibitions, the dissemination of reproductions and photographs, lectures,
and the provision of information and advice to inquirers abroad and to visitors in
Britain.
Architecture
The great interest shown in Britain since the end of the second world war both
in the development of modern architecture and in the preservation of architecture
AA
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
360
of historic value is reflected in the importance which the State accords to this branch
of the fine arts and in the number of professional, advisory and other societies and
institutions which exist to maintain and further both its practice and its art.
The Government Departments concerned are the Ministry of Housing and
Local Government, the Department of Health for Scotland, and the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Health and Local Government, which are responsible in their
respective countries for approving the layout and design of local authority housing
schemes, and which issue reports and circulars setting standards for local authority
housing. The Ministry of Works is the Department concerned with the preserva¬
tion of historic buildings and ancient monuments in Great Britain.1 All these
departments have architects on their staffs.
State-sponsored organizations concerned with special aspects of architecture
include the Royal Fine Art Commission, which is appointed by Royal Warrant to
advise Government Departments and other public and quasi-public bodies on
questions of public amenity or artistic importance; the National Buildings Record,
which maintains a library of photographs of English and Welsh architecture open
to the public for consultation, and an index of architectural records in public and
private possession; the Royal Commissions on Ancient and Historical Monuments
for England, for Wales and Monmouthshire, and for Scotland, which advise the
Ministry of Works on the care of these monuments and publish a series of surveys,
designed ultimately to cover the whole country; and the Historic Buildings Councils
for England, Scotland, and Wales, constituted under the Historic Buildings and
Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, whose most important function is to advise the
Minister on the provision of grants towards the repair and maintenance of such
buildings and their contents.2
The leading professional architectural institution in the United Kingdom is the
Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) which holds meetings at which papers
are read and discussed, publishes a Journal and holds exhibitions, promotes and
controls the training of architects through its Board of Architectural Education,
and has one of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world,
housing over 65,000 books, periodicals and drawings. Well-known societies include
the Architectural Association, the Architecture Club, and a number of societies
interested in particular aspects of architecture, for example, the Mars Group
the English Branch of Les Congres Internationaux d’Architecture Moderne—
and the Modular Society. Among the preservation societies are the Georgian Group,
which is a society designed to awaken interest in Georgian architecture and to save
Georgian buildings from destruction; the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings; and the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty,
which owns more than a hundred houses of historic or architectural interest,
many of which contain pictures and other works of art which are on view to the
public.3
Education in architecture is given at 18 schools of architecture, recognized for
exemption from the RIBA Intermediate and Final Examinations; and 6 schools of
architecture recognized for exemption from the Intermediate Examination only.
There are also 50 schools of art and technical institutions (14 full-time) with facili¬
ties for the instruction of intending architects, which prepare students for taking

externally the examinations of the RIBA. It is against the law for any person to
practise or carry out work under any name, style or title containing the word
‘architect’ unless he or she is registered. The statutory body which regulates the
registration is the Architects’ Registration Council of the United Kingdom.
Museums and Art Galleries
There are in all about 750 museums and art galleries open to the public in Great
Britain, though many are only small collections or merely a few rooms set aside in
a public building for the display of local treasures.
The national museums and art galleries in London probably contain between
them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic, archaeological,
scientific,1 historical and general interest ever to exist within one city. The British
Museum, which celebrated its bicentenary in 1953, has unparalleled collections of
archaeological and ethnographical material from every part of the world, in addition
to housing the national library of printed books, manuscripts, newspapers and
periodicals; its Department of Prints and Drawings also possesses collections of the
widest extent and richness. The Victoria and Albert Museum contains works of
fine and applied art of all countries and periods, arranged mainly according to
material, though since the war primary collections have been arranged to bring
together, by style, period or nationality, masterpieces of all the arts. The National
Gallery presents paintings by almost all the greatest European masters. The Tate
Gallery embodies two collections (a) the British school from the eighteenth century
onwards, with a few earlier works, and (6) modern foreign schools since 1850. Both
sections include modem sculpture.
Other important collections are at the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial
War Museum, the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, the London Museum
(reopened in Kensington Palace during 195 and Hertford House, in London,
where the famous M^allace Collection (furniture, objets d art and paintings, mainly
French of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) is housed. Many of the
national institutions in London suffered war damage to their buildings, and the
financial stringency of the post-war years combined with lack of space and staff
has resulted in these great museums and art galleries being still unable to do justice
to the wealth of material they possess.
There are five national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Royal
Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, and the Scottish
United Services Museum; and in Cardiff is the National Museum of Wales with
its branch at St. Fagans Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed.
Almost every city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology and
natural history, usually owned by the municipal authority, but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees to whom some rich collector
in the past has bequeathed his treasures. A notable example in the last category is
the Bowes Museum at Barnard Castle, containing one of the finest art collections
outside the capital cities. Both Oxford and Cambridge are rich in museums—the
Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, founded in 1683 is the oldest in the country, and
the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge has fine art galleries and a notable collection
of engravings, manuscripts and books bequeathed by its founder on his death in
1861. Other universities have important collections, primarily for teaching purposes
but also open to the public. The Municipal Museum and Art Gallery at Belfast

serves unofficially as a national institution for the whole of Northern Ireland; other
cities with important museums and art galleries are Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow,
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool (although the museum building destroyed in the war
has not yet been rebuilt), Manchester, Norwich, Southampton, and York where the
Castle Museum, with its complete reconstruction of an eighteenth-century street
of shops, offers one of the most interesting historical displays in the world. In recent
years there has been a notable development of ‘period-house museums’, in which
outstanding examples of the private residences of former times have been taken
over by national and municipal authorities for this purpose.
Temporary exhibitions, particularly on art subjects, including circulating
exhibitions produced by the Arts Council, the Art Exhibitions Bureau, and the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, are a regular feature
of many museums.
The Museums Association, founded in 1889, is an independent organization to
which museums and art galleries and members of their staffs throughout the
country belong; there are also many oversea members. The Association serves as
the central body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters
relating to museum administration and practice, and as a training and examining
body for professional qualifications. It also produces directories, a monthly
periodical, and other publications.
Financial assistance for improving the displays of the smaller museums is among
the activities of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which has done much to
encourage the growth of the museum movement during the past twenty-five years,
and at present expends an average of £10,000 a year in this field.
LITERATURE
A knowledge of literature is fostered in the United Kingdom by the schools,
colleges and universities of the country, in all of which English literature is taught
either as part of a general course or as a specialist subject. Interest in the subject is
thereafter maintained by the very large number of private literary societies (both
national and local), by the libraries (see pp. 363-4), and by the numerous periodicals
concerned in whole or in part with literature, of which the best known critical
weekly is the Times Literary Supplement. Recognition of outstanding literary merit
is given in the form of literary prizes, a number of which are awarded annually,
e.g., the two James Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography and literature,
the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young writers of promise, the
Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, and the Somerset Maugham award for
young writers. State support for literature is given through the Arts Council, which
supports poetry readings throughout the British Isles, and through the British
Council, which is active in encouraging a knowledge of English literature abroad.
Literary Societies and Institutions
Societies and institutions concerned with the promotion of literature in its
various forms include: the National Book League (13,000 members), which
encourages the reading of and an interest in books, and which holds exhibitions,
including the widely popular annual exhibitions of book design; the English
Association (3,000 members), which aims at upholding the standard of English
writing and speech; the Royal Society of Literature (250 members and 250 fellows),
which is concerned with the advancement of literature; the Royal Society of
Edinburgh (790 fellows), which promotes science and literature; and the British
Academy, which is an organization concerned with humanistic studies and has a
section dealing with literature and philology.
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
363
Interest in poetry is encouraged by the Poetry Society (3,000 members); by the
annual National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales, the origins of which
date back to the seventh century; and by the Apollo Society which, supported by
the Arts Council, presents a number of poetry readings in which music as well as
poetry forms part of the programme.
Among the specialist literary societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society, and several societies
devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens Fellowship
(10,000 members).
There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book Society (about
19,000 members), which exist to distribute selected new books to their members.
The most recently established is the Poetry Book Society (500 members), which
was set up in 1954 under the auspices of the Arts Council.
Books
The output of new books in Britain amounts to some 13,000 new titles a year in
1953. for example, British publishers issued a total of 18,257 separate titles, of
which only 5,523 were reprints or new editions. In that year, the annual figures for
new titles under literary subject headings were: bibliography and literary history,
262; biography, 433; essays, 98; fiction, 2,583; poetry and drama, 497.
Some classes of books are produced as Government publications by Her
Majesty’s Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organization in Britain;
the great majority of books, however, are produced by commercial publishers,
including the university presses, notably the Clarendon Press (Oxford) and the
Cambridge University Press, which publish many outstanding literary works.
Leading organizations representing the interests of those concerned with book
production are the Publishers’ Association, the Booksellers’ Association, and the
Society of Authors.
Libraries
The largest library in Britain is that of the British Museum in London (more
than 6 million printed books). The National Library of Scotland (nearly 2 million
volumes) is in Edinburgh and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (more than 1 million
volumes). Together with the Bodleian Library in Oxford (about 2 million volumes)
and the Cambridge University Library (which has over 2 million volumes) these
comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive a copy
of each new book published in Britain.
Other great libraries are1: the London Library (the largest public subscription
Library, 500,000 volumes); the University of London Central Library (547,ooo)2,
Edinburgh University Library (608,000); Glasgow University Library (418,000),
St. Andrews University Library (511,000); the John Rylands Library, Manchester
(over 500,000); the Science Library of the Science Museum (380,000); the Patent
Office Library (350,000); the Victoria and Albert Museum Art Library (300,000);
the National Library for the Blind (300,000—Braille and Moon types); the British
Library of Political and Economic Science (about 300,000); the British Museum
(Natural History) Library (250,000); Queen’s University Library, Belfast (225,000),
the Royal Institute of International Affairs Library (100,000); the Royal Geo¬
graphical Society Library (100,000); the Imperial Institute Library (100,000), the

Public Record Office Library (which contains the National Archives); the Royal
College of Music Library (160,000); the British Drama League Library (80,000);
the Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects (65,000); the Royal
Academy of Music Library (60,000); the Central Music Library (29,000). The
Arts Council has recently founded a reference library of modem English poetry,
which is housed at the National Book League.
The most important aspect of librarianship in Britain is the co-operation within
the closely knit network of libraries which greatly increases the value of the service.
Library co-operation is organized regionally in the first instance, through Regional
Library Bureaux, and is finally centralized in the National Central Library with
its widespread system of outlier libraries (public, university and special) giving
access to a total bookstock of 21 million books.
The public libraries of Britain are maintained by 580 public library authorities
in every county and county borough and in many boroughs and urban districts.
Together, these authorities provide more than 30,000 service points; they hold
over 56 million books and make more than 359 million loans a year. A feature of
the service in rural areas is the travelling van, which is an itinerant library.
In addition to lending books, and providing special libraries for children, public
libraries engage in many kinds of extension activities, such as play readings,
lectures, film shows, music circles and University Extension co-operation in adult
education.
The two principal professional bodies to which librarians belong are the Library
Association and the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux
(ASLIB). Whereas the Library Association, with a membership of 10,000, attempts
coverage of the whole field of library work—public, university and special—ASLIB,
which is a documentation centre and is financed by the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research, operates in a more specialized field. One of its activities, for
example, is the maintenance of an index of translations, especially from Russian
and German, which have been or are being made in Britain.
MUSIC, OPERA AND BALLET
In Britain today, music in all its forms is drawing large audiences; and orchestral
concerts, choral singing, music festivals, opera and ballet are important features of
British cultural life.
Music
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in all the large towns and
cities, some of which have well-known concert halls. In London, the principal
concert halls are the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank of the Thames, which
was opened in 1951 in connection with the Festival of Britain; the Royal Albert
Hall, Kensington; and Wigmore Hall, which is the premier recital centre of the
metropolis. Queen’s Hall, famous before the second world war for orchestral
concerts, was destroyed by enemy action and has not yet been rebuilt.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Symphony Orchestra, the
BBC Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic,
the Philharmonia, the Halle (Manchester), the Liverpool Philharmonic, the City
of Birmingham Orchestra, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, the Yorkshire
Symphony Orchestra, the Scottish National Orchestra and the BBC Scottish
Orchestra. There are also the highly specialized string orchestras such as the Boyd
Neel Orchestra and the Jacques Orchestra; and a number of new orchestras which
have been formed during the past few years. Many of these orchestras receive
RELIGION, SCIENCE, AND THE ARTS
365
financial aid from the Arts Council, whose aim is to provide them with the oppor¬
tunity of presenting new works, new conductors and new soloists, and of improving
the standard of performance generally.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC Choral,
the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the
London Philharmonic Choir, and the Bach Choir. These and many other choral
societies are associated with famous orchestras in major choral works; most of
them, together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies and music
clubs, are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies.
Music Festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually at Gloucester, Worcester and Hereford in rotation, have been in existence
for over 200 years. The festival idea has developed considerably in recent years, and
festivals of music and other arts are now held annually in many cities and towns.
They range from the famous Edinburgh International Festival of Music and
Drama, which lasts three weeks and attracts many thousands of visitors, to small-
scale festivals (such as the Aldeburgh Festival) lasting a week or less. Among the
better known are the Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the National Eisteddfod
of Wales; the National Gaelic Mod held at a different place in Scotland each year;
the Cheltenham Festival, devoted to contemporary British music; and the Leeds
and Norwich Festivals of choral music, which are held on a triennial basis. An
annual international festival of folk song and dancing is also held by the English
Folk Dance and Song Society.
Professional organizations, which look after the interests of music and musicians,
include the Musicians’ Union, the Incorporated Society of Musicians, the Com¬
posers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild. Specialized education in music is given
at Colleges of Music, of which the most prominent are the Royal Academy of Music
and the Royal College of Music in London, the Royal Manchester College, and the
Royal Scottish Academy in Glasgow, all of which receive grants-in-aid. There are
also the Trinity College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama
in London. Youth orchestras are strongly encouraged, and children’s concerts,
given by symphony orchestras directed by prominent conductors, are a regular
feature of the country’s musical activities and have helped to develop among the
youth of the community an appreciation of the world’s greatest music. The
National Youth Orchestra, made up of the most promising of the younger musicians,
is noted for its high standard of performance.
The British Council has done much to make British music more widely known
throughout the world. Tours of British orchestras, soloists and opera are arranged,
recordings of work by British composers are sponsored, and libraries of British
music (recorded and in printed score) are maintained in 57 countries overseas. At
the Council’s headquarters in London, a central music reference library of music
literature, scores and recorded music is maintained for the use of visitors. Distin¬
guished musicians from overseas are invited to Britain as guests of the Council to
experience, at first-hand, something of British music and musicians, and extensive
arrangements are made to cover each individual interest.
Opera and Ballet
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, which is leased by the Government1 to the Covent Garden Opera Trust,
which was formed in 1944 to make the famous opera house the home of a national
opera and ballet, and which receives a Government grant through the Arts Council.
1 The Ministry of Works acquired a 42-year lease from Covent Garden Properties
Ltd. in 1949.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
366
The Royal Opera House has its own resident opera company and ballet company
(the Sadler’s Wells Ballet) which give performances both in London and elsewhere.
The opera company, which numbers about 200 and has a permanent orchestra,
makes an annual tour of provincial centres; and the Sadler’s Wells Ballet has a high
international reputation gained during its visits to Canada and the United States in
1949, 1950 and 1953 and through its European tours, arranged by the British
Council.
Seasons of opera and ballet are also given at the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in
London, which, like the Royal Opera House, C-ovent Garden, has its own opera
company and ballet company (the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet); and at Glynde-
bourne in Sussex, an opera season, for which a company is specially assembled, is
held every year. Other opera companies include the Carl Rosa, one of the oldest
opera organizations in Britain; the English Opera Group, formed in i947> and
noted for its performances of chamber music; and Intimate Opera, which tours the
provinces, giving performances in any hall available and introducing opera to those
who have hitherto been unfamiliar with it. There are also a number of amateur
opera clubs both in London and in the provinces, including the City Opera Club
(of London) and the Welsh National Opera Company, which is an amateur society
reinforced with professional soloists. Among the ballet companies are the Ballet
Rambert, the Festival Ballet and the recently established Ballet Comique. Training
in ballet is given at the Sadler’s Wells Ballet School, which has played a large part
in raising British ballet to its present high standard.
XIII . SOUND AND
TELEVISION BROADCASTING
THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION
Sound broadcasting services in the United Kingdom are undertaken solely by
the British Broadcasting Corporation, which was created as a public corporation by
Royal Charter in 1927. At present, the British Broadcasting Corporation is also
solely responsible for the television transmission services; although, in due course,
an alternative television service will be provided under the aegis of the Independent
Television Authority (see pp. 371-2).
Policy and Constitution
The policy of the BBC is governed by its Charter, granted for successive limited
periods, which establishes the BBC as a corporate body and requires that the
broadcasting services should be a means of information, education and entertain¬
ment and should be developed to the best advantage and in the national interest.
Under the current charter, which came into force on 1st July 1952 and will be
due for renewal in 1962, the Corporation consists of nine Governors (including a
chairman, vice-chairman and national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland) appointed for a five-year period on a part-time basis by Orders-in-Council
on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governors are responsible as a corporate
body for taking all final decisions regarding both sound and television broadcasting.
In the discharge of this duty the Governors are advised by the Director-General,
who is the chief executive officer of the Corporation and with whom they must
discuss all major matters of policy and finance. The BBC’s Board of Management
is made up of the Director-General and six Directors (for Home Sound Broadcast¬
ing; Television Broadcasting; External Broadcasting; the Spoken Word; Technical
Services; and Administration), who are responsible under the Director-General for
the whole work of the Corporation. The number of staff employed at 30th June
1954 was 13,153 (including 656 part-time personnel).
The BBC derives its legal powers to maintain broadcasting stations from its
Licence and Agreement with the Postmaster-General. The Agreement contains
financial clauses and also certain general provisions as to the manner in which the
broadcasting service should be operated.
It has from the first been the agreed policy of Parliament that the BBC should
be free from control in the daily conduct of its business, including both the
planning of programmes and general administration. Thus, although Parliament
retains ultimate control of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and the Post¬
master-General, as the responsible Minister, is answerable to Parliament on
broad questions of policy, the Corporation has, so far as is practicable, full freedom
and responsibility for its work. The BBC studies the needs and reactions of its
listeners through its Audience Research system; it is assisted by 32 advisory bodies
and is constantly consulting outside authorities and experts, but its decisions are its
own. In its various activities the BBC devolves responsibility at all levels to the
greatest extent consistent with agreed policy and with its high standards of quality.
Finance
The services of the BBC are financed from (1) annual grants from the Exchequer
related wholly or partly to revenue derived from the sale (by the Post Office) of
367
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
368
wireless receiving licences; (2) a grant-in-aid from the Exchequer for the External
Services; (3) profits from the BBC publications, mainly the Radio Times, which has
a weekly sale of over 8 million copies and attracts a large advertising revenue.
The annual licence for the reception of sound broadcasting costs £1 (except in
the case of registered blind persons whose licences are free); the licence for ‘sound’
and television together costs £3. One licence covers all the receiving sets in a house¬
hold, but a separate licence is required for a set fitted in a motor car. Before the
second world war all the BBC’s operations were financed out of its proportion of
licence income. During the war it was completely financed by grant-in-aid; but, as
from 1 st January 1947 the pre-war system of financing out of licence income was
restored for all home broadcasting services including television.
In March 1954 the Government announced that the Exchequer would retain
£2 million each year from the licence revenue in the next three years and the Post
Office would receive a proportion estimated at £1,600,000 a year to cover the cost
of collecting fees and dealing with interference. In addition, £750,000 a year would
be given to the Independent Television Authority (see pp. 371—2) i*1 each of its
first two years of operation. The remainder would be given to the BBC.
The gross revenue from the sale of broadcast receiving licences during the year
ended 31st March 1954 amounted to £16,474,081, from which the Corporation
received a net income of £12,963,451. The number of current receiving licences
in the United Kingdom in March 1954 was: sound 10,187,901 (including 62,389
free to blind persons, and 226,667 for sets fitted in cars), television 3,248,892,
making a total of i3)436,793' By end-November 1954 the total was i3>794)195>
which 3,999,624 licences were for television sets, and 250,256 for sound sets fitted
in cars.
Net revenue from publications in the year ended 31§t March 1954 amounted
to £1,354,691 and grant-in-aid receipts were £4,905,000.
THE SOUND SERVICES
Since 15th March 1950 the BBC has operated on the wavelengths allocated in
the Copenhagen Agreement.1 Plans are, however, on foot to reinforce existing
long-wave and medium-wave services (which are increasingly suffering from
interference from high-power transmitters on the Continent) through a system of
VHP transmitters. The BBC estimates that it will need more than 50 of these
transmitters, placed at 20 stations to cover areas where local interference is high.
Work on the first nine of these stations, each of which will carry the Home, Light
and Third Programmes, has been authorized by the Postmaster-General.
Services provided are as follows:
1. For Home Listeners
The BBC provides three main services for home listeners:
(a) The Home Service, running continuously from 6.30 a.m. to 11.8 p.m., is a
carefully balanced programme designed to appeal to all sections of the com¬
munity. It is the vehicle for the majority of the BBC’s most important talks,
for plays, concerts, documentary features and religious broadcasts, and also
1 A European Regional Conference held in Copenhagen in 1948 produced a plan to
minimize interference between medium and long wave broadcasting stations by allocating
wavelengths to individual transmitters in such a way that stations sharing wavelengths, or
using adjacent wavelengths, were so far from each other that interference with reception
in their respective service areas should be negligible. The maximum power of each trans¬
mitter and the precision with which its allotted frequency must be maintained are also
specified in the Plan, which came into operation on 15th March 1950.
SOUND AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING
369
for all the educational broadcasts to schools (see p. 312). It includes contro¬
versial discussions, and time is allotted for political party broadcasts in the
ratio of each party’s poll at the last General Election. Many national and
sporting events are broadcast from the scene of action.
Linked with this basic Home Service are the six Regional Home Services
covering Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and the North, Midlands,
and West of England. These services carry many of the major items of the
basic Home Service but also include their own programmes produced within
the region. Material is freely interchangeable over this network.
(b) The Light Programme, running continuously from 9.0 a.m. to midnight, is
devoted to entertainment in the widest sense, and includes commentaries on
every form of sport. It contains also a more serious element including book
reviews, discussions, and some classical music.
(c) The Third Programme, running continuously from 6.0 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.
(and from 3 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. on Sundays during the winter months), is a
cultural programme especially designed for the serious listener. It broad¬
casts, without regard to length or difficulty, programmes of music, art and
letters (including lesser known works) likely to be of particular interest to
such listeners, and it provides series of lectures by eminent speakers. It has
been in operation since 29th September 1946.
News. There are eight news broadcasts daily in the Home and Light programmes:
Home Service at 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 1 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and a summary at 11 p.m.
Light Programme at 9 a.m., 7 p.m., 10 p.m., and a summary at 11.56 p.m. For its
sources of news the Corporation relies on the leading news agencies, the BBC’s
correspondents at home and abroad, and the monitoring service.
The BBC’s Audience Research organization estimates that, at any one time on a
winter evening, about 1 in 4 of the adult population of Britain may be expected to
listen to one of the three main programmes. It is calculated that the average winter
evening audience for the Light Programme is nearly 5,670,000, for the Home
Service 3,240,000, and for the Third Programme in the neighbourhood of 90,000.
2. External Services
The general purpose of the BBC, in all its broadcasts to listeners within
the Commonwealth or in other lands, is to form a link of information, culture
and entertainment; to give news of world-wide importance as it is known in
Britain; to show what the British nation as a whole is thinking about the news; and
to reflect the British way of life.
The relevant Government Departments prescribe the extent of the External
Services but have entrusted to the BBC the responsibility for their content.
The External Services of the BBC include:
(а) The General Overseas Service in English (the descendant of the original
‘Empire Service’, begun in 1932), which is designed for British communities
all over the world as well as for English-speaking listeners in foreign countries.
It includes many programmes taken from the BBC s home services, and
is on the air for 21 hours in every 24.
(б) Special Services directed to the Commonwealth in English and other languages.
(c) Services directed to foreign countries, mainly broadcast in the language of the
country addressed. The BBC’s news services have established a great reputa¬
tion for objectivity and integrity. Every day nearly 100 news broadcasts are
directed to oversea listeners in some 40 languages.
370 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(d) The Transcription Service, which provides recorded programmes in English
(talks, drama, features, music, etc.), distributed principally to radio
organizations throughout the Commonwealth and in the United States, and
to broadcasting stations of the Armed Forces overseas. It also produces
programmes in foreign languages.
Oversea Offices
The BBC maintains oversea offices in Berlin, Cairo, New Delhi, New York,
Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Toronto and Ottawa. Their purpose is to meet the pro¬
gramme requirements of the Home and External Services, to encourage local
stations to rebroadcast BBC transmissions and transcription recordings and to
disseminate information about the BBC External Services.
Apart from the oversea offices, the BBC maintains a high-power short wave relay
station for South-East Asia, at Singapore (Tebrau).
BBC TELEVISION SERVICES
Development
Experiments in television broadcasting started in Britain in the autumn of 1929,
and in November 1936 the BBC began to give from Alexandra Palace the first
public service of high definition television in any part of the world. By September
1939 (when the Alexandra Palace station was closed down for military reasons) the
programme technique had made considerable progress and the number of receiving
sets was approximately 20,000.
The Television Service from Alexandra Palace was reopened in June 1946 and a
second transmitter at Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham, came into action in
December 1949, relaying the Alexandra Palace programmes. By December 1952
five high-power transmitting stations were in operation: Alexandra Palace cover¬
ing London and the Home Counties; Sutton Coldfield covering the Midlands;
Holme Moss covering the North of England; Kirk o’ Shotts covering Central
Scotland; and Wenvoe covering South Wales and parts of the West of England.
These stations, with the addition of four temporary low-power stations, had by
1953 made television accessible to some 85 per cent of the population of the United
Kingdom and form the main part of the BBC’s plan for a national television
coverage. . . .
Further measures contemplated to extend national coverage include completing
five medium-power stations (Aberdeen, Belfast, Pontop Pike, South Devon and
the Isle of Wight)1 ; rebuilding the London station with higher power; and erecting
eight permanent low-power transmitters in East Anglia, the Isle of Man, the
Channel Islands and at Dover, Inverness, Londonderry, Towyn (West Wales),
and Carlisle, for which Government approval has already been given. This will
result in effective television coverage for 97 per cent of the population of the
United Kingdom. f
The BBC is building, on a 13-acre site at Shepherds Bush in London, a set ot
studios and accompanying accommodation which will, it is hoped, be the best
television centre in the world’.
Programmes
Regular television programmes are broadcast daily between 3.0 p.m. and
10.45 p.m. on weekdays, and between 4 p.m. and 10.45 P-m- on Sundays. There are
intervals in each programme, and actual viewing time averages five hours a day. In
1 The first of these five medium-power stations, at Rowridge, Isle of Wight, was
opened in November 1954-

addition, the Outside Broadcasting Department of the Television Service televises
national occasions, public events and sporting fixtures, and there is a daily television
programme for children. Television for schools is in the experimental stage.
Research
Constant research during 1952-53 resulted in developments in the design of
measuring equipment and television cameras, in the reduction of the effects of
interference, and in improvements in the technical quality of the pictures trans¬
mitted. Technically Britain is committed for some years to the present 405-line
standard, but preliminary experiments are being made on systems using higher
standards of definition, and on television in colour. To facilitate work of this kind,
a flexible television channel, which can be operated at will on standards of defini¬
tion from 400 to 1,000 lines, has been designed and constructed for use in the
laboratories.
INDEPENDENT TELEVISION SERVICES
The development of the broadcasting services has from the outset been assisted
by the recommendations of successive independent committees of inquiry set up
by the Government, e.g., the Crawford Committee (1926) which recommended the
establishment of the BBC; the Selsdon Committee (1935) which recommended the
establishment of a high definition public television service to be run by the BBC;
and the Beveridge Committee (1951) which made recommendations designed to
guard against the evils of monopoly, but was in favour of maintaining the BBC
in much its present form as ‘something of which the country might be proud’.
The idea of the public corporation as the most suitable administrative device
for the sound broadcasting services has, in fact, hardly ever been challenged;
but since the issue in May 1952 of the Memorandum on Broadcasting {Cmd. 8550)
which contained Government proposals for introducing competition in television,
discussions on the pros and cons of an alternative system for television services
have frequently been held in Parliament, in the press and by the general public.
In the 1952 Memorandum no details were published of the terms and conditions
under which competitive television would operate; and although it was stated that
safeguards would be established against possible abuses and that a ‘controlling
body would be required for regulating the conduct of the new stations, for exercis¬
ing a general oversight of the programmes and for advising on appropriate matters’,
a considerable body of opinion feared that the introduction of private enterprise
into a sphere of activity hitherto controlled by a public corporation might lead to a
debasing of entertainment standards.
On the other hand, there were many people who welcomed the idea of competi¬
tion, agreeing with the Government that ‘as television has great and increasing
power in influencing men’s minds, its control should not remain in the hands of a
single authority, however excellent that authority may be’.
The proposals outlined by the Government in the Memorandum on Television
Policy {Cmd. 9005), published in November 1953, were designed to reconcile these
two opposing viewpoints by combining effective control with greater freedom; and,
at the same time, to reduce to a minimum the financial commitments of the State.
In July 1954 they were incorporated into the Television Act, which provides for
the setting up of an Independent Television Authority, consisting of a chairman,
a deputy chairman and five to eight part-time members (three of whom have special
responsibilities for Scotland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland
respectively) appointed by the Postmaster-General to provide television services
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
372
additional to those provided by the BBC for a period of ten years or longer if Parlia¬
ment so decides at a later date. These appointments were made in August 1954,
and in September a Director-General was appointed to head an executive staff.
The programmes broadcast by the Authority are in general to be provided by
'programme contractors’, who on the one hand will receive revenue from firms which
advertise in the intervals of their programmes and on the other will pay the Authority
for the time allotted to them. The Authority will also be financed by (a) an annual
Exchequer grant not exceeding £750>000 an<f (^) advances which may be made by
the Postmaster-General, with the consent of the Treasury, for the purpose of defray¬
ing initial expenses and capital expenditure and of providing the Authority with
working capital. The advances are limited to £1 million in the first year from the
passing of the Act, and £2 million in all. Sponsored programmes, e.g., programmes
provided by advertising agencies, will not be allowed.
The Authority hopes to begin operation of its first services, for the London,
Birmingham and Manchester-Liverpool areas, by the autumn of 1955*
XIV. THE PRESS
The British Press caters for all political views, many different levels of education
and a wide range of interests. It is free from Government censorship and inter¬
ference.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the world.
For every 1,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom 611 copies of daily papers are
sold every day. Next on the list comes Sweden with 490 per 1,000 inhabitants; in
the United States the figure is 353. Circulation figures of individual newspapers
are proportionately high. The Sunday News of the World has the world record
circulation of over eight million copies, and at least six of the daily newspapers have
circulations in the millions. These high figures are largely explained by the fact
that the London morning papers have ‘national’ circulations, i.e. they are distributed
throughout the British Isles, being available on the day of publication everywhere
except in a few outlying islands.
Britain is, however, less well served in the size of newspapers because of the
shortage of newsprint due to the fact that most of it has to be imported and so
involves the expenditure of foreign exchange, especially dollars. This has meant
restriction of supplies in recent years when the balance of payments has been
under pressure. But there has been some improvement: from an average of four
to six pages in the war and immediate post-war period daily papers have risen to
an average of 8 to 12 pages. This still falls short of the pre-war figure which was
24 pages or more.
Prices of daily newspapers vary from i£d. for the popular papers to 4d. for
The Times.
There are over 150 daily and Sunday newspapers: 15 London mornings,
3 London evenings, 10 London Sundays; 26 mornings, 67 evenings and 4 Sundays
in England and Wales outside London; 8 mornings, 9 evenings and 3 Sundays in
Scotland; 4 mornings and 1 evening in Northern Ireland; 1 Isle of Man daily and
3 Channel Islands evenings.
There are about 1,350 weekly papers which are published in Greater London
and almost every sizable town in the rest of the country. These papers deal mainly
with news of interest to the region where they are sold. There are also the sporting
papers, papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident
in Britain, and religious papers.
In 1947 a Royal Commission on the Press was appointed to inquire into the
finance, control, management and ownership of the British Press. Its report was
issued in June 1949 (Cmd. 7700) and has been recognized as a comprehensive
and authoritative analysis. Among other recommendations it suggested the estab¬
lishment of a General Council of the Press and this was set up in 1953 (see P- 37^)-
The Commission found that the British Press ‘is completely independent of
outside financial interests and that its policy is the policy of those that conduct it ;
there was evidence that the direct influence of advertisers on policy was negligible .
After studying management and ownership, the Commission concluded that there
is nothing approaching monopoly in the press as a whole, or ... in any class of
newspaper’.
Ownership
As Table 51 shows, several companies or groups own a number of newspapers.
The five largest press groups are: Associated Newspapers Limited, which, with
three London papers, owns through subsidiary companies linked under the

management of Northcliffe Newspapers Group Limited a total of eleven dailies
(with an interest in two more), nine weeklies and one Sunday; Kemsley Newspapers
Limited, which owns twelve dailies, five weeklies and six Sundays and has interests
in five other newspapers; Westminster Press Group which controls thirteen dailies,
33 weeklies and one Sunday; Provincial Newspapers Limited, which owns four
dailies and twelve weeklies; and the Harmsworth Group, which runs four dailies
and eleven weeklies in the West country.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The ‘National’ Press
Nine morning papers with headquarters in London, and one in Manchester,
are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the British Isles, and there are
eleven ‘national’ Sunday papers (see Table 51). In addition, the leading Scottish
papers (see below) circulate widely, and certain specialized daily papers also have
a circulation not limited by region, e.g., The Financial Times (circulation 65,599).
The three London evening papers each have affiliations with one of the national
dailies, but they draw their readership very largely from people living within fifty
miles of London.
Other Newspapers of England and Wales
The provincial newpapers, numbering nearly a hundred morning or evening
dailies and Sunday papers and about 1,160 weeklies provide the general and local
news expected by readers whose daily life and interests are known to and shared
by the newspaper staff. Some 60 provincial papers still in existence were founded
before 1800; the oldest being Berrozv's Worcester Journal, dating back to 1709.
With a few exceptions (e.g., Yorkshire Post, Neivcastle Journal, Sheffield Telegraph,
Western Mail) they reflect no definite political tendency. The total circulation of
the dailies is estimated at about 9 million and of the weeklies at about 12 million.
The provincial newspaper, often read far more thoroughly than the national
daily, is a valuable medium for national and local advertising.
In Wales some of the papers are printed in Welsh, some in English, others in
Welsh and English.
London suburban weeklies, of which there are about 60, are closer to the
provincial weeklies than to the national dailies in readership and appeal.
Ownership of the provincial press is varied: it includes individual owners, two
or more partner proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, newspaper
companies owning between one and half-a-dozen papers or press groups con¬
trolling a chain of newspapers in different parts of the country.
Scotland
Scotland has eight morning, nine evening and three Sunday papers. There are
also about 120 weeklies. The Scotsman, Edinburgh (founded in 1817), and the
Glasgow Herald (founded in 1783), published daily, have national reputations and
regular subscribers overseas. The average circulation (January to June 1954)
The Scotsman is 54,484 and of the Glasgow Herald 75,851. Dundee and Aberdeen
papers also have more than regional circulation. The largest group owners of
newspapers and periodicals are the Thomson-Leng group of Dundee, which
distributes about 10 million weekly periodicals and magazines to all parts of the
world. There are four monthly illustrated periodicals The Scottish Field, Scotland s
Magazine, The Scots Magazine (founded 1779) and Scotland-, and two weeklies,
devoted to farming interests—The Farming News and The Scottish Farmer.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has four mornings and one evening, all printed in Belfast. In
addition to three newspapers in Londonderry which are each published three times
a week, there are 4'8 weekly papers. The majority are published by individual
companies and all the counties have good coverage of local papers. Weekly,
monthly and quarterly publications cover farming, the linen industry, building,
motoring and politics. There are no Sunday newspapers.
THE PRESS
377
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
The Channel Islands have three evening papers, one twice-weekly and two
weeklies. The Isle of Man has one daily of which a special weekly edition comes
out on Saturday, and four other weeklies.
Periodicals
Weekly, monthly and quarterly journals cover an enormous field. A salient
feature of the last twenty-five years has been the development of periodicals with a
mass appeal on the one hand, and the growth of the trade press on the other.
There are over 3,500 periodical publications: general magazines with circulations
ranging up to over a million j women s magazines, which also have large circula¬
tions; numerous publications for children; religious periodicals of various
denominations; magazines dealing with sports, hobbies, fiction and humour,
periodicals specializing in various subjects such as politics, finance and economics,
science, the professions, the arts; the large body of trade and technical publications
whose circulations often are not confined to the United Kingdom; and lastly, the
journals of learned societies, trade unions, business houses, regiments, universities,
colleges, schools, and other associations.
At the high circulation end of the scale are the popular periodicals, of which five
have circulations of over a million: Illustrated, John Bull, Tit-Bits, Reveille for the
Week End and Week-End Mail. Three women’s weeklies {Woman, Woman’s Ozvn
and Woman’s Weekly) and one women’s monthly {Woman and Home) also have
circulations in the millions. . .
Of considerable influence, although their circulations are only in the tens ot
thousands, are the weeklies dealing with political, social and economic affairs.
The Economist, which covers topics of the day from a far wider angle than its title
would indicate and is politically independent; The New Statesman and Nation
a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist political
tendency; The Spectator, which covers much the same subjects and is non-party;
Time and Tide, which has a right wing tendency; Tribune, with a left wing but
strongly anti-communist bias; and Truth, which is extreme right wing in its political
outlook Other papers whose circulations are in the tens of thousands are the
illustrated weeklies such as The Illustrated London News, Sphere, Field and Country
Life, while Punch is the leading humour periodical. The readership of all these
weeklies is greater than is apparent from their circulation figures, since they are
widely read in libraries, clubs and other institutions.
Monthly and quarterly journals, generally speaking, appeal to the more serious
type of reader, particularly the literary and political journals and those specializing
in international and Commonwealth affairs.
News Agencies
There are three principal British news agencies: , . ,
Reuters Ltd., a world agency with offices in many countries which distributes
foreign and Commonwealth news to British newspapers and foreign and British
news to over 3,000 papers outside Britain. It is owned by the British I ress and
three Commonwealth news agencies. All profits are used to develop the service.
Press Association Ltd., which distributes home news. It is owned by British
provincial newspapers. All profits are used to develop the service
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd., which is a public company which distributes
home and foreign news, mainly to British papers.
Two other agencies supply a general service of oversea new®:
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
378
British United Press, which is a Canadian subsidiary of the United Press of
America.
There are more than 20 smaller agencies in London, specializing in commercial
or sports news, photographs, features, and so on.
Press Institutions
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organized. On the
employers’ side, the most important organizations are the Newspaper Proprietors’
Association, whose members are proprietors of London (national) daily and Sunday
newspapers, the Newspaper Society, whose members are proprietors of provincial
daily and weekly newspapers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Scottish
Daily Newspaper Society, the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors’ Association, and
the Periodical Proprietors’ Association. On the employees’ side there are the
National Union of Journalists and the Institute of Journalists. The National Union
of Journalists has a membership of about 12,650 working journalists; editors who
have powers of dismissal are excluded. The Institute of Journalists, which has
a membership of some 2,800, admits editors. Free-lance journalists may belong to
the NUJ or loj. The aims of these organizations are the improvement of wages
and working conditions of journalists and of the status of the Press.
The aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are, inter alia, to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of editors,
to protect the rights and freedom of the Press, and to improve the education and
training of junior journalists.
The largest of other organizations directly connected with the Press is the
National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants (NATSOPA), which has
a varied membership connected with the production of newspapers and periodicals;
in addition to the groups indicated by the title of the society, its membership
includes clerical workers, dispatch hands and similar personnel.
The General Council of the Press
Following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Press, a
Press Council representative of the various Press organizations was set up in
1953. Its aims are:
to preserve the established freedom of the British Press;
to maintain the character of the British Press in accordance with the highest
professional and commercial standards;
to keep under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of informa¬
tion of public interest and importance;
to promote and encourage methods of recruitment, education and training of
journalists;
to promote a proper functional relation among all sections of the profession;
to promote technical and other research;
to study developments in the British Press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly;
to publish periodical reports recording its own work and reviewing from time
to time the various developments in the British Press and the factors
affecting them.
The Council consists of eight editorial representatives, four nominees of the
National Union of Journalists, three nominees of the Institute of Journalists, and
ten managerial representatives.
