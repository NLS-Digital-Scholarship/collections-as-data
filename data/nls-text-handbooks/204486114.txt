The Office for National Statistics works in partnership with others in the Government Statistical
Service to provide Parliament, government and the wider community with the statistical
information, analysis and advice needed to improve decision-making, stimulate research and
inform debate. It also registers key life events. It aims to provide an authoritative and impartial
picture of society and a window on the work and performance of government, allowing the impact
of government policies and actions to be assessed.
Foreword
Britain 1998 is the 49th in the series of annual
Handbooks, which go back to the 1940s, but
the first to be prepared by the Office for
National Statistics (ONS). Up to 1997,
The Britain Handbook was produced by the
Central Office of Information, but the staff
working on it were transferred to the ONS in
April 1997 and have now settled into their new
home in Pimlico, central London. See opposite
for the new address.
Drawing on a wide range of official and
other authoritative sources, The Britain
Handbook provides a factual and up-to-date
overview of the state of Britain, while also
covering government policy in all the nation’s
spheres of activity. It is widely recognised as
an established work of reference, both in
Britain itself, and overseas, where it is an
important element of the information service
provided by British diplomatic posts. It is sold
by The Stationery Office and its agents
throughout the world.
Special features
As always, the text, charts, tables and graphs
have all been fully updated and revised. This
year has been a particularly interesting one
because of the historic General Election in
May 1997, which brought a Labour
Government to power—with its largest ever
majority—after 18 years of Conservative rule,
the longest period of administration by one
party since 1830. As a result, the policy
chariges now being implemented, or proposed,
are more fundamental and wide-ranging than
they have been for many years.
In this edition we celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the National Health Service
(NHS), a ground-breaking development in
British medicine which has since influenced
the organisation of health services all over the
world. The introductory essay by Alan
Langlands, Chief Executive of the NHS
Executive in England, describes the history
and evolution of this national institution, the
problems it has faced and overcome, its many
achievements, and what the future might have
in store. Within the main body of the book,
chapter 24 also gives comprehensive coverage
of the current organisation of the NHS.
In addition, we have included a special
feature on the Government Art Collection (see
photograph and caption opposite). This
comprises an eight-page colour section in the
centre of the book and three images on the
cover. The cover images are:
• front cover—Richard Ernst Eurich: ‘The
Rescue’ (1971—4) (detail);
• back cover—Barbara Hepworth: ‘Conoid
Sphere and Hollow III’ (1937); and
• spine—Robert Adams: ‘Tall Spike Form’
(1956).
Another innovation which we hope readers
will find useful is the inclusion of individual
country maps in the chapters on England,
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, which
give the county, district, council and unitary
authority boundaries at 1 April 1998. We have
also expanded the list of historical dates in
chapter 1.
Finally, we remember Diana, Princess of
Wales (see photographs between pp. 64 and
65, and obituary on p. 539).
Coverage
Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in The Britain Handbook is
accurate at the time of going to press. The text
is generally based on information available up
to September 1997.
As far as possible, the book applies to Britain
as a whole, as the title suggests. However, care
should be taken when using it to note whether
the information given refers to:
• Britain, formally the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland;
VI
• Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland;
• England and Wales, which are
still grouped together for many
administrative and other purposes; or, in
some instances,
• England alone.
Acknowledgments
Britain 1998 has been compiled with the full
co-operation of around 250 organisations,
including other government departments and
agencies. The editor would like to thank all
the people from these organisations who have
taken so much time and care to ensure that the
book’s high standards of accuracy have been
maintained. Their contributions and
comments have been extremely valuable.

Fifty Years of the National
Health Service in Britain
by Alan Langlands
Alan Langlands joined the National Health
Service (NHS) as a graduate trainee in 1974
and is now the Chief Executive of the NHS
Executive in England and Britain’s most
senior health service manager. As well as
managing major teaching hospitals in
London during his career, he has run a
Regional Health Authority and been
responsible for a major review of the top
management of the NHS. Today, in
recognition of his achievements, he is an
honorary Professor at the University of
Warwick Business School and an honorary
Fellow of the Faculty of Public Health
Medicine of the Royal College of
Physicians. What follows is his personal
account of the past, present and future of
the NHS as it celebrates its 50th
Anniversary in 1998.
Alan Langlands
Your new National Health Service begins on 5th July. It will provide you with all medical,
dental, and nursing care. Everyone-—rich or poor, man, woman or child—can use it or any part of it.
There are no charges, except for a few special items. There are no insurance qualifications. But it is not a
“charity”. You are all paying for it, mainly as taxpayers, and it will relieve your money worries
in time of illness.
—from a leaflet issued by the Ministry of Health, February 1948
On a typical day in Britain in 1998 nearly 700,000 people will visit their family doctor and about
130,000 people will visit their dentist. Over 130,000 people will be treated in hospital outpatient
clinics, pharmacists will dispense about one-and-a-half million items on prescription, and around
2,000 babies will be delivered.
In over 300 district general hospitals surgeons will perform around 220 hip replacement and
other arthroplasty of the hip operations, 750 operations on the heart and 2,100 kidney operations.
Ambulances will make 8,000 emergency journeys. And 10,000 people will donate blood.
viii
FIFTY YEARS OF THE NHS
In the community, around 540,000 people will receive help at home from the NHS. District
nurses will make over 100,000 visits and chiropodists will provide some 6,000 sessions each day in
patients’ homes.
Impressive as they are, statistics like these represent only a fraction of what is routinely
achieved every day by the National Health Service. It is the same routine, more or less, that has
been re-run twenty-four hours a day every day for the last fifty years. The scale on which the
NHS operates today, and the financial and technical resources at its disposal, may have been
undreamed of back in the 1940s, but its underlying principles have remained unchanged since the
day it was founded.
Since 5 July 1948 the NHS has been charged with providing comprehensive healthcare for
every person in the United Kingdom, young and old, men and women, rich and poor, and for
improving the nation’s health as a whole. Everyone born in this country has been, or will be,
touched by the NHS at some point in their lives. As an institution it is one of the nation’s greatest
assets and success stories.
Indeed, the NHS is such an integral part of life in this country that many of us now take it for
granted, until we need it and suddenly remember how reassuring its existence has become. But it
has not always been like this, and as we celebrate its first fifty years it is worth reminding
ourselves why the NHS began and what it set out to do.
Healthcare Before the NHS
The NHS was founded on the principle that healthcare should be provided according to a person’s
clinical need, not on their ability to pay. It is difficult today to imagine what life must have been like
without free healthcare, and the difference it must have made to people’s lives when it was first
introduced. Fifty years ago, healthcare was a luxury not everyone could afford. Poor people often
went without medical treatment, relying instead on often dubious (and sometimes dangerous) home
remedies, or on the charity of doctors who gave their services free to their poorest patients.
The need for free healthcare was widely recognised, but it was impossible to achieve without
the support or the resources of the state. Throughout the 19th century philanthropists and social
reformers working in isolation had tried to provide free medical care for the poor. One such was
William Marsden, a young surgeon, who in 1828 opened a ‘dispensary for advice and medicines’.
Marsden’s grandly named London General Institution for the Gratuitous Cure of Malignant
Diseases, an ordinary four-storey house in one of the poorest parts of the city, was conceived as ‘a
hospital to which the only passport should be poverty and disease’, and where treatment would be
provided free of charge to any destitute or sick person who asked for it.
1 he demand for Marsden’s free services was overwhelming. By 1844 his dispensary, now
renamed the Royal Free Hospital, was treating 30,000 patients a year. With consultant medical
staff giving their services free of charge, and with money from legacies, donations, subscriptions
and fund-raising events, the Royal Free (in much expanded premises) struggled to fulfil
Marsden’s vision until 1920 when, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, it, too, was finally forced
to ask patients to pay whatever they could towards their treatment, just like every other voluntary
hospital in the country.
The Role of the Local Authorities
Alongside the charitable and voluntary hospitals, which mainly dealt with serious illnesses, the
local authorities of large towns provided ‘municipal’ hospitals: maternity hospitals, hospitals for
infectious diseases like tuberculosis and smallpox, and hospitals for the elderly, mentally ill and
mentally handicapped. Many of these were a mixed blessing.
Mentally ill and mentally handicapped people were locked away in large forbidding
institutions, not always for their own benefit but to save other people from embarrassment.
Conditions were often so bad that many patients became worse, not better.
IX
BRITAIN 1998
Older people who were no longer able to look after themselves also fared badly. Many ended
their lives in the workhouse, a Victorian institution feared by everyone, where paupers did unpaid
work in return for food and shelter. Workhouses changed their name to Public Assistance
Institutions in 1929, but their character, and the stigma attached to them, remained.
The Birth of the NHS
With the voluntary hospitals permanently on the verge of financial collapse and the municipal
hospitals almost universally loathed, there was no shortage of pressure for change. The first call
for a national health service is usually attributed to Beatrice Webb, who argued the case for a
‘state medical service’ in a submission to the Royal Commission on the Poor Law in 1909. Over
the next thirty years the case for reform was taken up and developed in a succession of key reports
from the Ministry of Health, the British Medical Association and others, culminating in the
ground-breaking Beveridge report of 1942.
Sir William Beveridge had been appointed by the Government to chair an inter-departmental
committee to look into the existing national insurance schemes. He made no detailed
recommendations about how a national health service should be run, but by identifying
healthcare as one of the three basic prerequisites for a viable social security system, he laid the
foundations for the NHS as we know it today.
The Beveridge report was followed by a White Paper, A National Health Service, published in
1944, which stated: ‘Everybody, irrespective of means, age, sex or occupation, shall have equal
opportunity to benefit from the best and most up-to-date medical and allied services available.’ It
said the services should be comprehensive and free of charge, and should promote good health as
well as treating sickness and disease.
In 1945 came a second White Paper. The NHS Bill of March 1946 proposed the
nationalisation of all the voluntary and municipal hospitals and the creation of 14 regional hospital
boards to control them.
The National Health Service Act, steered through Parliament by Aneurin Bevan, the Minister
of Health, became law on 6 November 1946. It laid the ground rules for the modern NHS: it was
to be ‘a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvements in the physical and
mental health of the people of England and Wales and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
illness’, funded through general taxation rather than national insurance contributions.
Early Difficulties in Establishing the NHS
The NHS became reality on 5 July 1948. To appreciate the scale of the achievement it is worth
remembering that Britain was at war with the Axis powers throughout the final years in which the
organisation was being pieced together. (In fact, it was the Second World War which
demonstrated that a centrally controlled health service could be run effectively.)
The NHS brought hospital services, family practitioner services (doctors, pharmacists,
opticians, dentists) and community-based services into one organisation for the first time. But it
had not been easy. Holding everything together and keeping everyone on board continued to be
an administrative nightmare (Bevan described it as ‘the chief headache’) for years to come.
However, the difficulties of administering the new system paled in comparison to its financial
problems, which became apparent almost immediately. It was impossible to predict the day-to-
day costs of the new service, and public expectations rose. Spending in the first nine months was
two-thirds higher than anticipated. ‘The sea of unmet need’, as one commentator has described
it, threatened to engulf the new service. Other uncontrollable costs added to the burden: medical
and technological progress—in new therapies, diagnostic techniques and equipment—was
gathering pace all the time, and scarce new drugs, such as penicillin and other antibiotics, for
which there was a huge demand, were still disproportionately expensive.
FIFTY YEARS OF THE NHS
Within three years of its creation, the NHS, which had been conceived as being available to
everyone free of direct charges, was forced to introduce some modest fees. Prescription charges of
one shilling (5p), which had been legislated for as early as 1949 but had not been implemented,
were introduced in June 1952. A flat rate of £1 for ordinary dental treatment was also introduced
at that time.
Many of the difficulties that emerged in the early days of the NHS have challenged its senior
management, and successive governments, ever since. Today the NHS has a workforce of over
one million people and a budget of some £42 billion a year; it is a sophisticated modern
organisation with all the advantages of state-of-the-art technology at its disposal. Yet the
fundamental questions that tested Bevan and his colleagues—how best to organise and manage
the service, how to fund it adequately, how to keep the often conflicting demands and
expectations of patients, staff and taxpayers in check, how to ensure that finite resources are
targeted where they are most needed—exercise us all to this day. Bevan foresaw all this. ‘We
never shall have all we need,’ he said. ‘Expectations will always exceed capacity. The service must
always be changing, growing and improving: it must always appear inadequate.’
The Advantages to the Public of the New NHS System
Despite the problems that had been experienced in setting it up, the NHS transformed
healthcare. The new arrangements enabled health professionals to work as teams in hospitals,
health centres and people’s homes and offer a complete range of care for each patient. The level of
co-operation may have been rudimentary by today’s standards of multi-disciplinary care, but it
was revolutionary at the time.
The cornerstone of the new service was the family doctor or general practitioner (GP).
‘Everyone aged 16 and over can choose his or her own doctor,’ explained the Ministry of Health
in 1948. ‘You will visit his surgery, or he will call on you, as may be necessary. The difference is
that the doctor will be paid by the Government, out of funds provided by everybody.’
Then, as now, the family doctor acted as ‘gate-keeper’ to the rest of the NHS, referring
patients where appropriate to hospital or specialist treatment, and prescribing medicines, drugs
‘and all necessary appliances’. In addition, expectant mothers could have the services of ‘a doctor
who undertakes maternity work, and of a midwife, as well as general care before and after
confinement’. Today there are 29,000 GPs, mostly working in group practices and supported by a
team of practice nurses and other staff.
Some of the services the family doctor could arrange were provided by the local authorities 
county councils and county borough councils—who were charged with making special provision
for the care of expectant and nursing mothers and children under five, and for providing
midwifery services, home nursing, all necessary vaccination or immunisation, and a health visitor
service ‘to deal with problems of illness in the home, especially tuberculosis’.
The family doctor also arranged hospital care. Patients were entitled to all forms of in-patient
and out-patient treatment in general or special hospitals, including maternity care, sanatorium
treatment, care of mental health, and all surgical operations, plus the help of consultants and
specialists of all kinds, ‘whether at hospital, at special health centres, or at your home’.
Dental services consisted of check-ups and all necessary fillings and dentures. There was a
school dental service and a special priority service for expectant and nursing mothers and young
children which was organised by the local authorities. Eye tests were provided by ophthalmic
opticians on production of a GP referral note; if a person needed glasses, the NHS could provide
‘several kinds of spectacles of different types’.
A major innovation was the notion of the community health centre—‘special premises’ with
accommodation and equipment supplied from public funds to enable family doctors, dentists and
others to work together to provide a range of services on the spot. There were also specialist ear
clinics at which the patient would get ‘an expert opinion upon deafness’ and, if necessary, ‘a new
hearing aid invented by a special committee of the Medical Research Council’.

BRITAIN 1998
What the NHS has Achieved
In its first fifty years the NHS has ushered in dramatic improvements in healthcare: it has
introduced national immunisation programmes that have all but eradicated potentially fatal diseases
such as measles, polio, meningitis, diphtheria and tuberculosis; it has presided over the first
combined heart, lung, liver and kidney transplants, and operations to replace hips and other joints
that have given thousands of people a second lease of life; it has delivered the first babies born by in
vitro fertilisation. The list of major achievements in medicine and science goes on and on.
An equally important, though often overlooked, achievement has been the way the NHS has
provided much of that care; how its willingness and ability to adapt to the changing needs of the
population and changing attitudes in society have enabled it to find ways of keeping up with, for
example, an ageing population, advances in technology, and changes in clinical practice.
For some people the type of care they receive has changed beyond recognition under the NHS.
New drug regimes and the growth of networks of community-based health and Social services—
provided in collaboration with local authorities, housing associations and voluntary
organisations—have given people with a mental illness or learning disability the chance to live as
independently as possible in their own neighbourhoods, where they are able to make the kinds of
day-to-day choices and decisions that institutional life usually denied them. Older people have
benefited from the development of community-based services from district nurses,
physiotherapists, chiropodists and others who give them the care and support they need to live
with dignity in their own homes for as long as possible. Closing down the crumbling Victorian
asylums and long-stay hospitals—considered by many to be a national disgrace—is probably the
greatest legacy the NHS has made to future generations.
In surgery, developments such as shorter-acting anaesthetics and ‘keyhole’ or endoscopic
procedures have had a wide-ranging impact on the way hospital care is provided. Even ten years
ago, a three-week stay after a routine operation was common, adding to the traditional image of
the hospital as a dormitory or hotel as much as a provider of treatment.
Nowadays, shorter recovery times and shorter stays mean that people are able to resume their
everyday lives much more quickly. For most people, going into hospital no longer means taking
weeks off work or being away from friends and loved ones for extended periods. In 1994—95, 24
per cent of all people treated in hospital were day cases and the proportion is expected to increase
further. This year every health authority is expected to provide at least 60 per cent of all non¬
urgent (‘elective’) surgery on a day basis.
Developments such as these are encouraging the growing trend away from healthcare provided
in hospitals to primary care that is provided in the local community, closer to where people live or
in their own homes.
Health Promotion and Prevention of Illness
Treating ill-health and its consequences is only one part of what the NHS does. It is also charged
with promoting good health, and in recent years has introduced a wide range of initiatives to
encourage people to stay fit and healthy. Anti-smoking campaigns alone have saved thousands of
people from lung cancer, bronchitis, emphysema, strokes and heart disease, whilst campaigns
extolling the benefits of a well-balanced diet and plenty of exercise have led to a healthier lifestyle
for many. National screening programmes have been introduced to screen all women aged
between 20 and 64 for cervical cancer at least every five years, and all women aged between 50
and 64 for breast cancer every three years.
Preventing disease rather than waiting to cure people once they are ill makes good sense for
several reasons:
• it stops people becoming seriously ill, and so reduces the need for hospital services;
• it reduces the number of working days lost through sickness absence (estimated to cost
Britain some £13 billion a year);
xii
FIFTY YEARS OF THE NHS
• the cost of preventing illness is cheaper than treating it with drugs or surgery; and
• for some diseases, such as AIDS, there is no alternative to prevention.
Since 1992 NHS policy on disease prevention and health promotion has been driven by targets
laid down in The Health of the Nation, a strategy to improve health in England by the year 2000,
which the new Government has said it will extend and update radically. Similar strategies are in
place for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As we approach the Millennium it is clear that,
while excellent progress has been made towards many of the targets, there are still areas—such as
teenage smoking—where more work needs to be done.
The Cost of Healthcare
The medical advances which have taken place in the past fifty years have revolutionised
healthcare and greatly increased our understanding of the causes of illness and disease. Today, we
can treat more diseases than ever before, and in many cases prevent them occurring in the first
place. Men and women now live longer; more babies survive the critical period just before or just
after birth; and it is rare for people to catch diseases such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria and
tuberculosis, let alone die from them.
Future developments in healthcare look even more promising. Advances in cell and molecular
science and advanced bio-engineering foresee treatments for chronic conditions such as
psychiatric illness, multiple sclerosis and arthritis.
Today clinicians can do more, try more, than ever. And as each new breakthrough takes root,
the public s expectations of the NHS grow even greater. Pressure on services is rising inexorably.
In 1994—95 there were around 10.5 million new referrals to hospital and 18 million people were
treated at accident and emergency departments. Surgeons performed over 3.6 million operations
and hospitals provided around 13 million completed episodes of care. Last year in England
demand for non-elective services rose by 4.5 per cent, and demand for mental health services rose
by 5 per cent.
Statistics like these help to explain why the NHS is now the second largest spending
programme in the country. Over the past 20 years successive governments have raised NHS
expenditure in Britain by an average of 3 per cent per annum in real terms. In 1997-98 the total
cost of the NHS was £36 billion in England and £42 billion for Britain as a whole—more than
£1,700 for every household in the country. Ninety-four per cent of this money is raised from
direct taxation, through either income tax or National Insurance contributions. This ensures that
employers in Britain benefit from low direct costs, in contrast to schemes based on private
insurance (as in the USA) or social insurance (adopted in some countries in Europe).
Managers and senior clinicians in the NHS are responsible for ensuring that these huge
resources are spent as effectively and efficiently as possible whilst making sure that health services
are available to everyone on the basis of clinical need. Maintaining this delicate balance at a time
when people rightly expect high-quality services which are organised and run around their
individual needs rather than the convenience of the system is the enduring challenge of the NHS.
The fact that the NHS continues to meet the challenge is a tribute to the dedication and
professionalism of all those who work in it; in fact, in a recent report from the OECD the NHS
was recognised as ‘a remarkably cost-effective institution’. It achieves health outcomes
comparable to those achieved in other countries with similar or higher incomes, and at a cost in
terms of share of national income (5.5 per cent of UK Gross Domestic Product in 1996-97) that
is significantly lower than in most other countries. Furthermore, productivity across the NHS has
risen by more than 40 per cent over the past twenty years, broadly in line with trends across the
economy as a whole. In the 1990s the service has delivered average increases in efficiency of 2 per
cent a year including, since 1994-95, reductions in management costs of some £350 million.
Shortly after taking office the present Government announced a comprehensive spending
review. One of the things the review will consider is the contribution the NHS makes to the well¬
being of the economy as a whole, something that has never been fully investigated. This is
xiii
BRITAIN 1998
surprising, given that the NHS is responsible for helping to keep Britain at work literally. It is the
biggest single employer in Europe, one of the cornerstones of the British pharmaceutical industry,
has a huge capital investment programme, and spends some £440 million a year on research and
development. After fifty years in existence, the idea that the NHS is a giant sponge that simply
soaks up public money and gives nothing back to the economy looks like being laid to rest at last.
Two Decades of Change
One of the myths about the NHS is that it has been in a state of organisational turmoil since the
day it was created. In truth, there was relative stability for the first thirty years. But in the 1970s
two major reorganisations within a decade saw different administrative layers come and go.
The 1974 reorganisation introduced a three-tier management system to England, consisting of
regional health authorities, 90 area health authorities and 206 district management teams, each of
which would manage its affairs collectively (‘consensus management’). Community health
services that had previously been provided by local authorities—such as district nurses,
immunisation and vaccination, school health and ambulance services—were transferred to the
NHS. Five years later the Government decided to remove the area tier and create 192 new
district health authorities in its place.
In 1983 the Government asked a leading businessman, Sir Roy Griffiths, to scrutinise the NHS’s
management procedures. ‘If Florence Nightingale were carrying her lamp through the corridors of
the NHS today, she would almost certainly be searching for the people in charge,’ he wrote.
Griffiths recommended abandoning decision-making by consensus and replacing administrators
with general managers with clear performance targets. Doctors would be involved in running their
budgets, and treatments would be evaluated to make sure they were cost-efficient and clinically
effective. The ideas that emerged from Griffiths—the insistence on value for money, and on the
link between funding and the quality and quantity of healthcare—have guided the development of
the NHS ever since.
It was against this background that, in 1988, there began a fundamental review of every aspect
of the NHS, from the way services were delivered to the way they were paid for. The resulting
White Paper, Working for Patients, introduced the concept of the internal market whereby, from
1991, the ‘providers’ of healthcare were to be separated from the ‘purchasers’ of healthcare. The
idea was that by giving the purchasers the freedom to choose where to buy the best care,
including the private sector, the system would place competitive pressure on the providers to
offer greater quality, efficiency and value for money.
Fundamental changes had to be made to the traditional relationships between the various parts
of the NHS to make the new system work. Health authorities ceased to run the service directly
and became ‘purchasers’ of healthcare on behalf of their populations from a range of ‘providers’
(hospitals, community services, ambulance services) who, in turn, were given the opportunity of
becoming NHS Trusts—self-governing bodies with the freedom to decide things like staff
numbers, rates of pay and what to charge for their services. (Though independent of health
authority control, Trusts remain part of the NHS and are ultimately accountable to the Secretary
of State for Health.)
A central role in the new system was reserved for family doctors who, for the first time, were
offered budgets to buy a range of services for their own patients, such as elective (non-emergency)
surgery, out-patient treatment and specialist nursing care. Family doctors could become
‘fundholders’ and negotiate annual contracts with providers of healthcare, making them
competitors with health authorities as purchasers of healthcare.
To its supporters, like some of the fundholders themselves, this meant unprecedented freedom
to obtain the best for patients, control budgets and shape what hospitals did. Opponents believed
it was creating a two-tier system, in which patients of non-fundholders had to wait longer for
hospital treatment than patients of fundholders, and which placed fundholders under pressure to
buy cheap care before effective care.
xiv
FIFTY YEARS OF THE NHS
Looking to the Future: What Next?
The Government elected on 1 May 1997 pledged itself to ending the internal market and
developing an alternative organisational model. It has recommitted itself unequivocally to the
principle of universality in healthcare and has stated that, ‘if you are ill or injured there will be a
National Health Service there to help; and access to it will be based on need and need alone, not
on your ability to pay, or on who your GP happens to be, or on where you live.’ The new system
will reinforce the underlying values of equity, efficiency and responsiveness, and will take account
of the need to provide incentives that will ensure an integrated approach to health and social care,
with financial control systems that maintain clear lines of public and parliamentary accountability.
It will also be flexible enough to deal with changing circumstances and to encourage innovation at
local level.
The Government has also committed itself to increasing NHS spending every year, to
achieving higher-quality standards in the provision of care, and to maintaining a leading role for
primary care. These commitments will drive NHS policy for the next five years.
As Chief Executive of the NHS Executive in England, it is my job to make sure that the
Government’s objectives are met, so that during the next five to ten years the NHS will provide
genuinely integrated preventative care, treatment and after-care; that we will plan and deliver
healthcare which is more effective and responsive to people’s needs; that we will provide good
services at a local level, serving people in or as close as possible to their homes, but offering
treatment and care in more specialist centres where this is required. My colleagues in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland will be working towards the same ends. Our approach will be based
on the flexible working of health and social care professionals rather than one which revolves
around institutions.
The NHS has come a long way in its first fifty years. Its very existence is the mark of a
civilised society. Yet no society has the ability to provide every treatment that patients would
wish. How, and to what extent, the NHS will be funded in future is, as ever, a matter of ongoing
debate. One thing is clear: difficult choices will have to be made about patient and service
priorities, and ultimately they will have to carry public support. I am equally clear that the first
duty of the NHS is to respond to those in greatest need.
The NHS has retained the allegiance of the people to an extent that cannot be matched by
other public systems: a 1996 public opinion poll found that 86 per cent of people believed that the
NHS is the most important of our public services for them and their families. Furthermore,
throughout the world, no better model than the NHS has been found for adapting to change and
for making the best use of available resources to meet the demand for healthcare. As it celebrates
its fiftieth anniversary, that is probably the best tribute it could receive.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
1 Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England,
Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
and is one of the 15 member states of the
European Union (EU). Its full name is the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the British.
Isles. The largest of the islands is Great Britain.
The next largest comprises Northern Ireland,
and the Irish Republic. Western Scotland is
fringed by the large island chain known as the
Hebrides, and to the north east of the Scottish
mainland are the Orkney and Shetland Islands.
All these, along with the Isle of Wight, Anglesey
and the Isles of Scilly, have administrative ties
with the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the
Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between
Great Britain and France are largely self-
governing, and are not part of the United
Kingdom.
With an area of about 242,000 sq km (93,000
sq miles), Britain is just under 1,000 km (about
600 miles) from the south coast to the extreme
north of Scotland and just under 500 km
(around 300 miles) across at the widest point.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom,
they have a special relationship with it. The
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the 10th and 11th centuries and
remained subject to the English Crown after
the final loss of Normandy to the French in
the 15th century. The Isle of Man was under
the nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266,
and eventually came under the direct

Today the territories have their own legislative
assemblies and systems of law; the Isle of Man
also has its own system of taxation. The
British Government is responsible for their
international relations and external defence.
1
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Climate and Wildlife
The climate in Britain is generally mild and
temperate. Prevailing winds are south-westerly
and the weather from day to day is mainly
influenced by depressions moving eastwards
across the Atlantic. The weather is subject to
frequent changes. In general, there are few
extremes of temperature; it rarely rises above
32°C (90°F) or falls below -10°C (14°F).
Average annual rainfall is more than 1,600
mm (over 60 inches) in the mountainous areas
of the west and north but less than 800 mm
(30 inches) over central and eastern parts.
Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the
year but, on average, March to June are the
driest months and September to January the
wettest. During May, June and July (the
months of longest daylight) the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five hours in
northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight. During the months of shortest
daylight (November, December and January)
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of
an hour a day in northern Scotland and two
hours a day on the south coast of England.
As in much of the rest of the world, the
temperatures in Britain have been rising
over recent years. The 12-month period
from November 1994 to October 1995 was
the warmest in the 330-year temperature
record for central England; and the 24
months from May 1995 to April 1997 were
the driest two-year period in the 230-year
rainfall record for England and Wales.
These changes in climate may be arising
partly from increasing emissions of
greenhouse gases, although it is still too
early to be certain about this.
Meanwhile, there is some evidence to
suggest that the British spring is arriving
on average one week earlier in the 1990s
than it did in the 1970s. Certainly, some 20
bird species have been laying their eggs
earlier each year since 1971 (although the
stock dove is laying significantly later).
Britain is home to a great variety of
wildlife, with an estimated 30,000 animal
species, as well as marine and microscopic life;
about 2,800 species of ‘higher’ plants; and
many thousands of mosses, fungi and algae.
However, the unusual weather of recent
years—together with other factors, such as
changes in farming methods—has put
pressure on a number of species. There are
currently 116 separate biodiversity species
action plans being implemented by the
Government, with the aim of conserving species
and their habitats. In January 1997, the Joint
Nature Conservation Committee recommended
that a further 33 species—including the water
vole, basking shark, marsh fritillary butterfly,
bluebell and sandy stilt puffball—be given
added protection to ensure their continued
survival in Britain (see pp. 361-3).
Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a Celtic
original. Although in the prehistoric timescale
the Celts were relatively late arrivals in the
British Isles, only with them does Britain
emerge into recorded history. The term
‘Celtic’ is often used rather generally to
distinguish the early inhabitants of the British
Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in
55 and 54 BC, contact between Britain and the
Roman world grew, culminating in the Roman
invasion of AD 43. Roman rule was gradually
extended from south-east England to include
Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of
Scotland. The final Roman withdrawal in 409
followed a period of increasing disorder
during which the island began to be raided by
Angles, Saxons and Jutes from northern
Europe. It is from the Angles that the name
‘England’ derives. The raids turned into
settlement and a number of small English
kingdoms were established. The Britons
maintained an independent existence in the
areas now known as Wales and Cornwall.
Among these kingdoms more powerful ones
emerged, claiming overlordship over the
whole country, first in the north
(Northumbria), then in the midlands (Mercia)
and finally in the south (Wessex). However,
further raids and settlement by the Vikings
from Scandinavia occurred, although in the
10th century the Wessex dynasty defeated the
invading Danes and established a wide-ranging

invaded by the Normans (see p. 6), who then
settled along with others from France.

England is predominantly a lowland country, although there are upland regions
in the north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian mountains and the Yorkshire
moorlands) and in the South West, in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset. The
greatest concentrations of population are in London and the South East, South
and West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the West Midlands
conurbation, the north-east conurbations on the rivers Tyne and Tees, and
along parts of the Channel coast. England’s population is expected to rise from
48.9 million in 1995 to 51.2 million in 2016.
Early History
The name ‘England’ is derived from the Angles,
one of the Germanic tribes which established
monarchies in lowland Britain in the 5th
century, after the final withdrawal of the
Romans in 409. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms
were initially fairly small and numerous, but
gradually larger entities emerged. Eventually
Wessex came to dominate, following its leading
role in resisting the Danish invasions of the 9th
century. Athelstan (924—39) used the title of
‘King of all Britain’, and from 954 there was a
single Kingdom of England. The present Royal
Family is descended from the old royal house of
Wessex.
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle of
Hastings, and Normans and others from France
came to settle. French became the language of
the nobility for the next three centuries, and the
legal and social structures were influenced by
those prevailing across the Channel.
Almost all the English Crown’s possessions
in France were lost during the late Middle
Ages. The union of England and Scotland took
place in 1707, leaving England as the most
populous part of the British nation state.
Government
In contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, England has no government minister or
department exclusively responsible for its
central administration. Instead, there are a
number of government departments, whose
responsibilities in some cases also cover aspects
of affairs in Wales and Scotland (see Appendix
1). A network of ten Government Offices for
the Regions (GORs—see p. 9) is responsible for
the implementation of several government
programmes in the English regions.1
1 However, for statistical purposes, Merseyside and the.North
West are sometimes treated as one region. This is because of the
difficulties associated with obtaining the full range of data for
Merseyside alone, since it is a relatively small area.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
History Around Us
A large number of important archaeological
discoveries were made in England during
1997, of which the following are some of the
most notable:
• A royal Anglo-Saxon tomb in
Northamptonshire, dating from the
mid-7th century. Archaeologists have
unearthed a steel-surfaced iron sword,
a ceremonial bowl, and an iron helmet
with nose guard, crescent-shaped
cheek guards and a wild boar-shaped
crest. This ‘boar helmet’, of a type
often mentioned in Old English
literature, is only the second ever to
have been found in Europe.
• Two Roman villas near Swindon in
Wiltshire. One of them, to the north of
the town, may prove to be the largest
villa in Britain dating from the final
century of Roman occupation. The
other site, to the south of Swindon, has
already produced a double-handled jar,
probably for holding beer, and the
finely carved bone handle of a folding
razor.
• What appears to be a platform,
walkway or raft, over 6,400 years old,
in Hayling Bay, Hampshire. The same
diving team that located the Tudor
warship, the Mary Rose, 17 years ago
has discovered a large structure at the
edge of where the sea level was at the
time, by the ancient river Solent. The
structure is certainly worked timber
rather than natural wood. If it turns
out to be a raft, it would be one of the
oldest ships ever found anywhere in
the world, but either way it is a find of
great archaeological significance.
• The largest series of dinosaur
footprints ever found in Britain. The
footprints were discovered by chance
in a quarry in Dorset, on National
Trust land. The series is made up of 52
prints, the biggest of which is 1.13
metres (44 inches) in diameter. They
belong to sauropods, vegetarian
dinosaurs who lived in the area over
140 million years ago.
Following a boundary review in 1995,
there are now 529 English parliamentary
constituencies represented in the House of
Commons. After the General Election of
1 May 1997, England had 328 Labour
Members of Parliament (MPs), 165
Conservative, 34 Liberal Democrat and one
independent.2 Conservative support tends to
be strongest in suburban and rural areas, and
the party has a large number of parliamentary
seats in the southern half of England. The
Labour Party has tended in the past to derive
its main support from the big cities and areas
associated with traditional industry, but it won
many seats in the General Election that had
previously been considered safe Conservative
constituencies. The Liberal Democrats, who
are strong in the South West, have recently
been gaining greater support in other parts of
England, and the party now has a third of its
34 English seats in Greater London and the
South East.
Local government is mainly administered
through a two-tier system of counties
subdivided into districts. However, there are a
number of single-tier, or unitary, authorities
—especially in larger cities. The current
restructuring of local government in England,
now well advanced, will be completed in 1998
(see p. 80).
England elects 71 representatives (MEPs) to
the European Parliament (see p. 116), which
meets in full session in Strasbourg for about
one week every month, although its committee
work normally takes place in Brussels.
The English legal system comprises on the
one hand a historic body of conventions known
as ‘common law’ and ‘equity’, and, on the
other, parliamentary and European
Community (EC) legislation. In the
formulation of common law since the Norman
Conquest, great reliance has been placed on
precedent. Equity law—law outside the scope
of the common law or statute law—derives from
the practice of petitioning the Lord Chancellor
in cases not covered by common law.
2 The Speaker of the House of Commons, who presides over the
debates there (see pp. 59 and 64), traditionally does not vote along
party lines and so is not counted towards the strength of the party
for which he or she was originally elected. The independent MP is
the former journalist Martin Bell, who won what had been the safe
Conservative seat of Tatton in Cheshire.
8
ENGLAND
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church at
the time of the Reformation in the early 16th
century, is the Established Church (that is, the
official religion of England). The Sovereign
must always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops (see pp. 460-1).
The Regions of England Covered by the GORs
The Economy
Considerable changes in the economy of
England have occurred during the 20th
century. In the past 50 years, jobs in service
industries have grown and now account for
three-quarters of employees in employment,
with expansion having been particularly
noticeable in financial and business services.
Services account for three-quarters of gross
domestic product (GDP) in London and the
South East, and over a quarter of employees in
Greater London work in financial services.
London is one of the world’s leading centres
of banking, insurance and other financial
services.
Manufacturing, although declining as a
proportion of the employment base, remains
important in a number of areas. In terms of
GDP, it is most significant in the West
Midlands (where manufacturing accounted for
31 per cent of the region’s GDP in 1995, as
opposed to 22 per cent in the country as a
whole), the North and the East Midlands.
In agriculture, dairying is most common in
the west of England; sheep and cattle are
reared in the hilly and moorland areas of the
North and South West. Arable farming, pig
and poultry farming and horticulture are
concentrated in the east and south.
As part of its plans to devolve more power
to the regions, the new Government intends to
set up Regional Development Agencies which,

“Employees in employment only; figures do not include the self-employed.
among other things, would promote
regeneration, inward investment and small
businesses in their regions (see p. 371).
Transport
The motorway network comprises four long¬
distance routes linking London and the cities
of the Midlands, the North and North West,
and the South West; the London orbital route
(M25); and over 30 shorter motorways. In all,
there are about 2,800 km (1,750 miles) of
motorway in England, plus about 7,700 km
(4,800 miles) of other trunk roads.
Virtually the entire railway system has now
been privatised. The Government plans to
strengthen regulation of the private train-
operating companies, and of the infrastructure
company, Railtrack, which was floated on the
Stock Exchange in May 1996.
Cultural and Social Affairs
London and the other large cities have a
wealth of cultural centres, including major art
galleries, many renowned museums, theatres,
ballet and opera houses, and concert halls.
Many theatres outside London are used for
touring by the national theatre, dance and
opera companies. Popular culture also thrives
in England, as elsewhere in Britain: there are
numerous kinds of pop music, theatre styles
such as pantomime and musicals, jazz festivals
and performances by comedians. Safari,
wildlife and theme parks all offer family
activities and entertainment. Some of the
proceeds from the National Lottery (see p. 47)
are allocated to arts projects.
Many regions and towns have associations
with great English writers, artists and
musicians: such as Stratford-upon-Avon
(William Shakespeare), the Lake District
(William Wordsworth), Stoke-on-Trent
(Arnold Bennett), Haworth (the Bronte
sisters), Dorset (Thomas Hardy), and the
Cotswolds (Laurie Lee); Essex and Suffolk
(John Constable) and Salford (L.S. Lowry);
and Worcestershire (Edward Elgar) and
Aldeburgh (Benjamin Britten).
The Environment
Despite its relatively high population density
and degree of urbanisation, England still has
many unspoilt rural and coastal areas. There
are now nine National Parks, six forest parks,
36 designated ‘areas of outstanding natural
beauty’, 22 environmentally sensitive areas,
over 200 country parks approved by the
Countryside Commission, more than 1,000
km (625 miles) of designated heritage
coastline, and about 2,000 historic buildings
and some 3,600 gardens open to the public.
There are also nearly 200 National Nature
Reserves.

About half of the 1.6 million people in Northern Ireland are settled in the
eastern coastal region, the centre of which is the capital, Belfast. Most industry
is sited in this part of the Province. Northern Ireland is at its nearest point only
21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a 488-km (303-mile) border with the
Irish Republic.
According to the 1991 Census, 50.6 per cent
of the people regarded themselves as
Protestants and 38.4 per cent as Roman
Catholics. Most of the Protestants are
descendants of Scots or English settlers who
crossed to north-eastern Ireland; they are
British by culture and tradition and
committed to remaining part of Britain. The
Roman Catholic population is mainly Irish by
culture and history, and the majority of them
favour a united Ireland. Northern Ireland has
a younger population with proportionately
more children and fewer pensioners than any
other region in Britain.
History
During the tenth century Ireland was
dominated by the Vikings. In 1169 Henry II of
England launched an invasion of Ireland. He
had been granted its overlordship by the
English Pope Adrian IV, who was anxious to
bring the Irish church into full obedience to
Rome. Although a large part of the country
came under the control of Anglo-Norman
nobles, little direct authority was exercised
from England during the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish insurgents.
The main focus of resistance was the northern
province of Ulster. After the collapse of this
resistance in 1607 and the flight of its leaders,
Ulster was settled by immigrants from
Scotland and England.
The English civil wars (1642-51) led to
further risings in Ireland, which were crushed
by Oliver Cromwell. More fighting took place
after the overthrow of the Roman Catholic
James II in 1688. During the Battle of the
Boyne in Ireland in 1690 the forces of James II,
who was trying to regain the throne, starting in
Ireland, were defeated by those of the
Protestant William of Orange (William III).
Throughout most of the 18th century there
was uneasy peace. In 1782 the Irish Parliament
(dating from medieval times) was given
legislative independence; the only constitutional
tie with Great Britain was the Crown. The
Parliament, however, represented only the
privileged Anglo-Irish minority, and Roman
Catholics were excluded from it. In 1798 an
abortive rebellion took place, led by Wolfe
12
NORTHERN IRELAND

Tone’s United Irishmen movement. Three
years later Ireland was unified with Great
Britain; under the 1801 Act of Union the Irish
Parliament was abolished and Irish members
sat in both Houses of the Westminster
Parliament in London.
The Irish question was one of the major
issues of British politics during the 19th
century. In 1886 the Liberal Government
introduced a Home Rule Bill designed to give
a new Irish Parliament devolved authority
over most internal matters while Britain
maintained control over foreign and defence
policy. This led to a split in the Liberal Party
and the failure of the Bill. In 1893 a second
Home Rule Bill was approved by the House of
Commons but rejected by the House of Lords.
The issue returned to the political agenda
in 1910 because Asquith’s Liberal
administration was dependent, for its political
survival, on support from the pro-Home Rule
Irish Parliamentary Party. The controversy
intensified as unionists and nationalists in
Ireland formed private armies. In 1914 Home
Rule was approved in the Government of
Ireland Act. Implementation, however, was
delayed by the outbreak of the First World
War.
A nationalist rising in Dublin in 1916 was
suppressed and its leaders executed. Two
years later the nationalist Sinn Fein party won
a large majority of the Irish seats in elections
to the Westminster Parliament. Its members
refused to attend the House of Commons and,
instead, formed the Dail Eireann in Dublin.
A nationalist guerrilla force called the Irish
Republican Army began operations against the
British administration in 1919.
The 1920 Government of Ireland Act
provided for the establishment of two Home
Rule parliaments, one in Dublin and the other
in Belfast. The Act was implemented in 1921
in Northern Ireland, when six of the nine
counties of the province of Ulster received
their own Parliament and remained
represented in, and subject to the supreme
authority of, the British Parliament.
In the South the guerrillas continued to
fight for independence. A truce was agreed in
June 1921, followed by negotiations between
the British Government and Sinn Fein. These
were concluded in December 1921 with the

signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty establishing
the Irish Free State, which became a republic
in 1949.
From its creation in 1921, Northern
Ireland’s Parliament had a consistent unionist
majority from which government ministers
were drawn. The nationalist minority resented
this persistent domination and their effective
exclusion from political office and influence.
An active and articulate civil rights
movement emerged during the 1960s.
Although reforms were made in response,
sectarian disturbances developed. This led to
the introduction in 1969 of British Army
support for the police. These sectarian
divisions were subsequently exploited by
terrorists from both sides, most notably by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA),
which claimed to be protecting the Roman
Catholic minority.
Because of increased terrorism and inter-
communal violence, the British Government
took over responsibility for law and order in
1972. The Northern Ireland unionist /
Government resigned in protest at this
decision and direct rule from London began.
Government
Under the system of direct rule, the United
Kingdom Parliament approves all laws, and
Northern Ireland’s government departments
are controlled by the Secretary of State-—a
Cabinet minister—and a ministerial team.
Northern Ireland elects 18 Members of
Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons.
In the most recent general election in May
1997 the Ulster Unionists won 10 seats, the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour
Party (SDLP) 3, the Democratic Unionists 2,
Sinn Fein 2,' and the United Kingdom
Unionist 1. The Alliance Party, offering an
alternative to Unionists and Nationalists,
received 8 per cent of the vote but no seats.
(See Table 3.1 for a full breakdown of the
results.) Northern Ireland elects three
representatives to the European Parliament.
Local Government
In Northern Ireland government departments
and a range of public bodies provide
important services which are normally the
responsibility of local authorities elsewhere in
Britain. The Province’s 26 district councils
have limited executive functions together with
certain consultative and representational roles.
Various statutory bodies administer regional
services, such as education and libraries,
14

health and personal social services, housing,
drainage and fire services. In June 1997 the
Government announced a number of
initiatives to strengthen local government in
the Province. They included the possibility of
legislation to give councils ‘a power of general
competence’ to do what they consider
appropriate in the interests of their district
and its people; proposals to increase the
representation of councillors on public bodies;
and a fuller consultation between district
councils and central government, particularly
in planning.
Efforts to Achieve Devolved Government
Throughout the period of direct rule,
successive British Governments have favoured
a devolved administration widely acceptable to
both unionist and nationalist political
traditions. In 1974 a unionist-nationalist
coalition Executive was formed but soon
collapsed as a result of a protest strike by those
unionists opposed to power sharing. In 1982
an Assembly was elected by proportional
representation but was dissolved four years
later because no agreement could be reached
between the parties on a devolved
administration.
In 1991 and 1992 the four main
constitutional parties (Ulster Unionists,
Democratic Unionists, Alliance Party, and
Social Democratic and Labour Party) held a
series of talks with the Government and,
where appropriate, the Irish Government, to
see whether they could reach an agreement
taking into account the three sets of
relationships relevant to the Northern Ireland
problem—within Northern Ireland itself;
within the island of Ireland; and between the
British and Irish Governments. The talks
ended without agreement.
Since then, the British Government has
been engaged in a series of bilateral talks with
the Northern Ireland parties in order to
explore the basis on which they might come
together for further discussions. This work led
to the launch of the negotiations which started
in June 1996 (see p. 16). The aim of all these
discussions was to produce a settlement
attracting widespread agreement among the
two political traditions in the North.
Relations with the Irish Republic
The British and Irish Governments have
worked closely together in order to bring
peace to Northern Ireland. The 1985 Anglo-
Irish Agreement created an Intergovernmental
Conference in which both governments
discuss issues such as improved cross-border
co-operation and security. Under the
Agreement, the Irish Government can put
forward views and proposals on matters
related to Northern Ireland provided that
these are not the responsibility of a devolved
administration in Belfast.
Recent Developments
• The Downing Street Declaration, signed
by the British and Irish Governments in 1993,
set out the views of the two Governments on
ways towards a future settlement based on the
fundamental principles that the consent of a
majority of people in Northern Ireland would
be required before any constitutional change
could come about.
• In August 1994 the IRA announced a
ceasefire; this was followed in October 1994 by
a similar ceasefire on the part of the loyalist
paramilitary organisations. Shortly afterwards
the British Government began separate
exploratory talks with Sinn Fein and with the
Progressive Unionist and Ulster Democratic
parties, in order to explore the basis on which
they could be admitted to the talks process
and stressing the need for the
decommissioning of illegally held weapons
before these parties could take part in multi¬
party negotiations.
• In February 1995 the British and Irish
Governments published two documents,
together called Frameworks for the Future,
outlining what an overall settlement might
look like. Their aim was to serve as an aid to
discussion and negotiation between the
parties.
• In November 1995 the two Governments
established an independent International Body
to assess the issue of decommissioning illegal
weapons. Chaired by former US Senator
George Mitchell, the International Body
reported in January 1996. It concluded that
there should be some decommissioning during
15
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
the talks and set out six principles of
democracy and non-violence to which it said
all parties should adhere. It also proposed an
elected body for further negotiations to
‘contribute to the building of confidence’.
• The IRA announced the end of its ceasefire
in February 1996 and subsequently carried out
bomb attacks both on mainland Britain and in
Northern Ireland. At the end of February the
British and Irish Governments agreed that all¬
party negotiations should begin in June 1996
and that there could be no question of
ministerial meetings with Sinn Fein or of Sinn
Fein’s participation in the negotiations until
there was an unequivocal restoration of the
IRA ceasefire.
• Following an election in Northern Ireland
on 30 May 1996 to provide delegates from
whom participants in all-party negotiations
could be chosen, 110 representatives were
returned: 5 from each of the 18 parliamentary
constituencies and 2 from each of the 10 most
successful parties across the Province. The
representatives took their seats in a
deliberative forum whose purpose is to discuss
issues relevant to promoting dialogue and
understanding within Northern Ireland. Sinn
Fein were entitled to attend the forum but
have never done so. The parties represented in
the forum—except for Sinn Fein—were
invited to select negotiating teams to
participate in the all-party talks which had
begun on 10 June. As agreed between the
Governments in February 1996, Sinn Fein’s
participation required an unequivocal
restoration of the IRA ceasefire.
• The two Governments invited members of
the independent International Body which
examined the decommissioning issue to chair
those aspects of the talks requiring
independent chairmanship. The all-party talks
and the forum were temporarily suspended in
March 1997, following the announcement of
the British General Election in May and local
government elections in Northern Ireland.
• The Government which took office in May
1997 is seeking to secure a political settlement
acceptable to all sections of the community. It
is pursuing this objective through all-party
talks (see below). The Government has stated
that it considers the key elements of a political
settlement would be: devolution in Northern
Ireland, including an Assembly elected and
operating on a widely acceptable basis; sensible
cross-border arrangements between Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic; and new
arrangements between Britain and the Irish
Republic, including formal constitutional
acceptance of the principle of consent and a new
more broadly based Anglo-Irish Agreement.
• In June 1997 the British and Irish
Governments jointly put forward proposals
for resolving the decommissioning of illegal
weapons. By September 1997 these had so far
failed to secure sufficient consensus, but the
two Governments have stated that they
believe the proposals represent a broadly
acceptable way forward, reflecting the
approach set out in the Mitchell Report. They
have been extensively clarified and the two
Governments have stated that they consider
they meet the concerns of all sides. An
Independent Commission to make proposals
for decommissioning and to monitor its
implementation has since been established.
• On 19 July 1997 the IRA announced a
restoration of its ceasefire. After careful
consideration of all the circumstances
following the IRA announcement, the
Secretary of State announced on 29 August
1997 that she had decided to invite Sinn Fein
to enter the talks. Sinn Fein would be
required to make their commitment to the
principles of democracy and non-violence set
out in the Mitchell Report. The talks resumed
on 9 September when Sinn Fein reaffirmed
their commitment to the six Mitchell
principles of democracy and non-violence.
• A major breakthrough occurred on 24
September 1997 when the participants in the
all-party negotiations, meeting in plenary
session, launched the three strands of
substantive political negotiations. They also
agreed to establish means to help make further
progress on decommissioning and other
confidence-building measures.
• The Government has proposed that
substantive talks conclude by May 1998. Any
agreement reached would have to command a
broad measure of support among the parties
representing each of the main communities.
16
NORTHERN IRELAND
It would also be put to a referendum of all
people in Northern Ireland alongside a
concurrent referendum in the Irish Republic.
The settlement would also require the
approval of Parliament at Westminster.
Human Rights
Economic and social deprivation persists on
both sides of the Northern Ireland
community. However, on all major social and
economic indicators, Roman Catholics
generally experience higher levels of
disadvantage than Protestants, leading to
feelings of discrimination and alienation which
in turn influence attitudes to political and
security issues. Government guidelines aim to
promote fair treatment by ensuring that
policies and programmes do not discriminate
unjustifiably against, for example, people of
different religious beliefs or political opinion,
women, disabled people, ethnic minorities and
people of different sexual orientation. The
Government also provides grant aid to local
government programmes designed to
encourage mutual understanding and
appreciation of cultural diversity; support is
also given to the Cultural Traditions
Programme, which attempts to show that
different cultures do not have to lead to
division. The aim of these initiatives is to
encourage a more pluralistic and tolerant
society with equal esteem for unionist and
nationalist traditions.
The Standing Advisory Commission on
Human Rights advises the Secretary of State
on the effectiveness of anti-discrimination
laws and measures. The Commission
published a report on employment equality in
June 1997. It finds that the fair employment
legislation passed in 1989 has had a positive
impact on employment equality and makes
radical proposals for changes to policies and
procedures in education, training, and the
government initiatives on targeting social
need. The Government is studying its
recommendations.
Direct or indirect discrimination in
employment on grounds of religious belief or
political opinion is unlawful. All public
authorities and all private employers with
more than ten employees are required to
register with the Fair Employment
Commission. There is also compulsory
monitoring of the religious composition of
workforces, continual review of recruitment,
training and promotion procedures, and
affirmative action if fair employment is not
provided. Criminal penalties and economic
sanctions exist for defaulting employers. The
Fair Employment Tribunal deals with
individual complaints about discrimination.
An independent Chief Electoral Officer
maintains the accuracy of the electoral
register, while electoral boundaries for
parliamentary constituencies are determined
by impartial statutory procedures conducted
by the Boundary Commission for Northern
Ireland. The Northern Ireland Ombudsman
and Commissioner for Complaints deal with
complaints by the public against government
departments and local authorities. An
independent commission supervises police
investigations into the more serious
complaints against police officers and, at its
discretion, the investigation of other matters
(see p. 95).
The Parades Commission
The Parades Commission is an independent
body whose role is to help resolve disputes
over contentious parades in Northern Ireland.
It was established in March 1997 in response
to the recommendations of an independent
review,2 appointed to examine the whole
question of parades and associated public
order issues. The Government is to introduce
legislation later in 1997 to provide a statutory
role for the Commission and to give it specific
functions, in particular, the power to make
decisions on contentious parades.
Over 75 per cent of parades each year are
organised by the Protestant/Unionist
community, especially the ‘Loyal Orders’.
Most take place during the ‘marching season’,
which runs from around Easter to the end of
September.
2 Report of the Independent Review of Parades and Marches (the
North Report), 1997.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Security Policy
In order to protect the public, legislation gives
the authorities exceptional powers to deal with
and prevent terrorist activities. These include
special powers of arrest for those suspected of
certain serious terrorist offences, non-jury
courts to try terrorist offences (see p. 98) and
the banning of terrorist organisations. The
legislation is subject to annual independent
review and to annual approval by Parliament.
The Government has stated that, once a
lasting peace is established, there will be no
need for these exceptional powers and is
keeping the requirement for them under
continuing review.
An Independent Commissioner observes
and reports on the conditions under which
terrorist suspects are detained by the security
forces in police offices known as Holding
Centres. The Commissioner submits an
annual report to the Secretary of State which
is published.
Statutory codes of practice apply to the
detention, treatment, questioning and
identification of suspects. A breach of any of
the codes’ provisions by a police officer is a
disciplinary offence.
The Economy
Trends in output and employment tend to
reflect those in Britain. In 1996 Northern
Ireland lost 35 days for every 1,000 employees
because of labour disputes, a better record
than in any other region of Britain.
Some 74 per cent of employees work in
service industries and 17.7 per cent in
manufacturing. The largest industrial
employer is Short Brothers, owned by the
Canadian company Bombardier, with some
6,000 employees engaged on the manufacture
of aircraft and their components, guided
missiles and related products and services.
The shipbuilder Harland and Wolff employs
1,768 people.
In 1995-96 the value of exports increased
by 18 per cent to £3,100 million. Exports
account for 77 per cent of product sales. The
Irish Republic is the most important market
outside Britain, taking 8 per cent of exports in
1995-96.
Agriculture accounts for 4.9 per cent of
gross domestic product or 8 per cent if
ancillary industries are included—higher
percentages than in any other region in
Britain. Some 10 per cent of the workforce is
employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing and
ancillary industries.
Tourism, which is promoted throughout
the world by the Northern Ireland Tourist
Board, sustains about 12,500 jobs. In 1996,
1.4 million people visited Northern Ireland,
generating £206 million in revenue.
Overseas and other companies are
important investors. Northern Ireland
attracted almost 5 per cent of all new
investment jobs in Britain in 1996—97 even
though it accounted for only 3 per cent of the
British population. Around 200 externally
owned companies employ around 45,000
people, nearly half the manufacturing labour
force. US-owned companies, for example,
employ over 14,000 people in the Province.
Many overseas companies use the region as a
base for operations in the ever-increasing
European market. In June 1997, for example,
Seagate Technology, a US computer software
manufacturer, announced a further
investment of £149 million in its operations at
Londonderry in a project expected to provide
1,125 new jobs by the year 2002. This brings
the total amount committed by Seagate to
Londonderry to some £323 million.
The Industrial Development Board (IDB)
encourages industrial development and new
international investment. In 1996-97, 6,000
new jobs were created by new and established
companies. In the same year the IDB
successfully negotiated 35 new investments or
expansions by externally owned companies;
these are expected to result in 4,640 new jobs.
The Local Enterprise Development Unit
and local enterprise agencies run by people
with business skills and expertise assist the
establishment and growth of small businesses
as well as expertise. In 1996-97 the Unit
recorded an 11 per cent increase in
employment among its small business clients.
In the same year 42 per cent of its financial
commitment—£14 million—was directed
towards disadvantaged areas.
Considerable public expenditure has been
devoted to improving conditions in urban and
18
NORTHERN IRELAND
rural areas. Since 1974 there has been a 92 per
cent reduction in housing unfitness levels in
Belfast.
The recently completed cross-harbour road
and rail bridges have transformed Belfast’s
infrastructure at a cost of £89 million. The
telecommunications firm BT has started work
on its new £30 million riverside Laganside
headquarters. Other important Laganside
developments include Belfast City Council’s
new concert hall and conference centre, and a
182-bedroom Hilton International hotel, a £24
million project on which construction work
began in 1996. Over 250 economic, social and
environmental projects in the city’s
disadvantaged areas have been supported in a
bid to improve education, training for adults,
and job-finding services for unemployed people.
Northern Ireland currently receives around
£1,300 million under the EU Structural
Funds Programme (see p. 199). Over the
period 1995-99 some £200 million of this
comes from the Special Support Programme
for Peace and Reconciliation. The five areas
eligible for funding are: employment; urban
and rural regeneration; cross-border
development; social inclusion; and productive
investment and industrial development.
Under the Programme up to 80 per cent of
funds are allocated to Northern Ireland, and
the remainder to the border counties of the
Irish Republic. At least 15 per cent of the total
must be spent on cross-border activities.
The Government makes a contribution of
over £3,000 million a year to maintain social
services at the level of those in Great Britain,
to meet the cost of security measures and to
compensate for the natural disadvantages of
geography and lack of resources.
In 1986 the British and Irish Governments
established the International Fund for Ireland.
Some three-quarters is spent in Northern
Ireland, the rest going to border areas in the
Republic. Programmes cover business
enterprise, tourism, community relations, urban
development, agriculture and rural
development. Donors include the United States,
the European Union, Canada and New Zealand.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Northern Ireland’s cultural heritage is
preserved and portrayed by the Ulster
Museum in Belfast, the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down and the
Ulster-American Folk Park in Omagh, which
specialises in the history of Irish emigration to
America. Plans to merge these three museums
into a single National Museum of Northern
Ireland are in progress. The merger is expected
to take effect by April 1998. There are also
several local museums and heritage centres,
mainly funded by local district councils.
Local arts festivals are an important feature
of the arts calendar, the highlight being the
Belfast festival, based at Queen’s University.
The Ulster Orchestra has a notable reputation.
Government support for the arts is channelled
through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland,
which gives financial help and advice to opera
and drama companies, orchestras and festivals,
arts centres, galleries, theatres, writers and
artistic groups.
Local district councils provide leisure
facilities, including leisure centres and
swimming pools. The Government finances
the Sports Council for Northern Ireland,
which promotes sport and physical recreation.
Proceeds from the National Lottery
provide an additional source of funding for
arts and sport in Northern Ireland.
Health and personal social services
correspond fairly closely to those in the rest of
Britain. Although the figures have been falling
in recent years, Northern Ireland still has a
high birth rate relative to the rest of Britain,
imposing heavy demands on maternity and
child care expenditure. Northern Ireland’s
elderly population is also increasing and the
demands made on geriatric services are
growing. On average over a fifth of the income
of households comes from social security
benefits, a higher proportion than in any other
region of Britain.
Although publicly financed schools must be
open to children from all religions, in practice
Roman Catholic and Protestant children are
mainly educated in separate schools. There are
now 33 integrated schools for both Protestant
and Roman Catholic children out of a total of
1,158 publicly financed primary, secondary
and grammar schools, and this process of
integration is being encouraged by the
Government (see p. 438.)

public housing to those in greatest need.

Three-quarters of the population of Scotland and most of the industrial towns
are in the central lowlands. The chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital), Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Dundee. Scotland contains large areas of unspoilt and wild
landscape, and the majority of Britain’s highest mountains, including Ben Nevis
(1,343 m, 4,406 ft), the highest peak in Britain. Scotland is to have its own
Parliament, while remaining part of the United Kingdom and having continued
representation in the Parliament at Westminster (London). A referendum in
September 1997 approved this by a substantial majority.
Early History
At the time of the Roman invasion of Britain,
what is now Scotland was mainly inhabited by
the Piets. Despite a long campaign, Roman
rule was never permanently extended to most
of Scotland. In the sixth century, the Scots
from Ireland settled in what is now Argyll,
giving their name to the present-day Scotland.
War between the kingdoms of England and
Scotland was frequent in the Middle Ages.
There were, though, strong links between the
kingdoms: several Scottish kings held land and
titles in England and there was intermarriage
between the Scottish and English royal
families. Despite reverses such as the defeat of
William Wallace’s uprising in 1298, Robert
the Bruce’s victory over Edward II of England
at Bannockburn in 1314 ensured the survival
of a separate kingdom of Scotland.
The two crowns were eventually united
when Elizabeth I of England was succeeded in
1603 by James VI of Scotland (James I of
England), who was her nearest heir. Even so,
England and Scotland remained separate
political entities during the 17th century, apart
from an enforced period of unification under
Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s. In 1707 both
countries, opting for closer political and
economic union, agreed on a single parliament
for Great Britain.
Devolution
Devolution in Scotland (and Wales) is an
important part of the Government’s

programme of constitutional reform (see
chapter 7). The Government’s proposals were
set out in a White Paper—-Scotland's
Parliament—in July 1997. The new Parliament
will have significantly greater powers than
those envisaged in the 1979 Scottish Assembly,1
including powers over economic development
and assistance to industry.
A referendum in September 1997 endorsed
the Parliament by 1,775,045 votes (74.3 per
cent) to 614,400 (25.7 per cent). A second
question in the referendum on the
Parliament’s tax-raising powers (see p. 23) was
also supported, by 1,512,889 votes (63.5 per
cent) to 870,263 (36.5 per cent).
1 Proposals to establish a Scottish Assembly were endorsed in a
referendum in 1979, but the proportion of the total electorate voting
in favour of the Assembly was below the required level of 40 per cent.
Scottish Parliament
Legislation to establish a Scottish Parliament
is to be introduced as soon as possible.
Elections will be held in the first half of 1999,
and it is expected that the Parliament will
become fully operational in 2000.
Electoral Arrangements
There will be 129 Members of the Scottish
Parliament (MSPs), who will be elected for a
fixed four-year period:
• 73 MSPs representing single-member
constituencies, which will be the same as
the parliamentary constituencies (except
that Orkney and Shetland will be split
into two seats); and

• 56 MSPs from party lists elected on the
additional member system of
proportional representation—seven from
each of the eight European parliamentary
constituencies.
Each elector will have two votes: one for a
constituency MSP and one for a party list.
Functions
Responsibilities to be transferred to the
Scottish Parliament include: health; education
and training; local government; housing;
economic development; the law and home
affairs; transport; the environment;
agriculture, fisheries and forestry; and sport
and the arts.
Where it has responsibility, the Scottish
Parliament will be able to amend or repeal
existing Acts of Parliament and to pass new
legislation. Among the areas where
responsibility will remain with the
Government in Westminster are overseas
affairs, defence and national security, overall
economic and monetary policy, employment
legislation, social security, and most aspects of
transport safety and regulation.
The Parliament will be located in Edinburgh.
There will be a Scottish Executive, headed by a
First Minister who will normally be the leader
of the party able to command majority support
in the Parliament. The Secretary of State for
Scotland will represent Scottish interests within
the British Government.
The Scottish Parliament and Executive will
have an important role in scrutinising those
aspects of European Union (EU) business
which affect the devolved responsibilities.
Like other regional governments in the EU,
Scotland will be able to have its own
representative office in Brussels.
The Scottish Executive will have
responsibility for all public bodies whose
functions and services will be devolved—
around 95 organisations—and will be
accountable to the Parliament for them. An
independent review will examine how to build
the most effective relationship between the
Parliament/Executive and local authorities.
Financial Arrangements
The Scottish Parliament will have a budget
broadly equivalent to that currently controlled
by the Secretary of State—£14,274 million in
1997-98. Once the amount of the budget has
been determined, the Parliament will be free
to allocate resources across the expenditure
programmes.
The Parliament will have the power to
increase or decrease the basic rate of income
23
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
tax—currently 23 pence in the pound—by a
maximum of 3 pence. Liability will be based
on residence. A person will be resident in
Scotland if he or she is a British resident for
tax purposes and either spends 50 per cent or
more of the tax year in Scotland or has his or
her only or principal home in Scotland.
The Parliament will be responsible for
determining the form of local taxation and, if
it considers it wise to do so, will be able to
alter both the council tax and business rates.
Current Government Arrangements
Scottish administration is at present the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, working through the Scottish
Office. Separate Acts of Parliament are passed
for Scotland where appropriate.
There are 72 Scottish seats in the House
of Commons. At the May 1997 General
Election, Labour strengthened its position as
the largest party, gaining six seats, while the
Conservative Party lost all its 10 seats. In
October 1997 Labour had 55 Members of
Parliament (MPs), Liberal Democrats 10 and
the Scottish National Party 6, with one
vacant seat following the death of a Labour
MP. The Government announced in the
White Paper Scotland's Parliament that there
would be a statutory requirement for a
minimum number of Scottish seats in the
House of Commons. The Parliamentary
Boundary Commission (see p. 59) will take
this into account in its next full review of
constituency boundaries; any change would
affect the number of constituencies in the
Scottish Parliament.
In 1996 a single-tier structure of 29 local
authorities replaced 62 regional and district
councils (see map on p. 22).
The principles and procedures of the
Scottish legal system differ in many respects
from those of England and Wales. These
differences stem, in part, from the adoption
of elements from other European legal
systems, based on Roman law, during the
16th century. For example, a Scottish jury
can give a verdict of ‘not proven’ as an
alternative to ‘not guilty’ when the accused is
acquitted. Scotland has its own prosecution,
prison and police services.
Industry
As traditional industries such as coal, steel and
shipbuilding have declined, there has been
growth in high-technology industries, such as
chemicals, electronic engineering and
information technology, and in the service
industries. Scotland has one of the biggest
concentrations of the electronics industry in
Western Europe, with around 200 plants
employing some 39,000 workers. The industry
accounts for around 18 per cent of
manufacturing output in Scotland and is the
biggest export sector.
Some traditional industries, such as high-
quality tweeds and other textiles, and food and
drink products, remain important. There are
92 whisky distilleries in operation, mostly in
the north east, employing 10,700 people.
Whisky exports, valued at £2,300 million in
1996, are Scotland’s second largest export
trade.
Services
Services now employ over 70 per cent of the
workforce. The Scottish financial sector is the
sixth largest in Europe in terms of equity funds
under management, with the total funds
managed being £172,000 million in 1995. There
are four Scottish-based clearing banks, which
have limited rights to issue their own banknotes.
Tourism and leisure make a significant
contribution to the economy, accounting in
1996 for around 177,000 tourism-related jobs.
In 1996 expenditure by tourists was valued at
£2,400 million; there were 12.5 million tourist
trips, including those originating in Scotland.
Industrial Development
Government support for enterprise and
training is channelled through Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, which both have general functions
in economic development, training and
environmental improvement in the Scottish
lowlands and the Highlands and Islands
respectively. They contract with 22 Local
Enterprise Companies (LECs, led by the
private sector), which arrange the provision of
training and business support.
24
SCOTLAND
Investment by overseas companies has
made a significant contribution to the growth
of modern industry. In 1996-97, Locate in
Scotland and the Scottish Office helped to
attract 86 inward investment projects to
Scotland, involving planned investment of over
£3,100 million. The projects are expected to
create or safeguard nearly 14,300 jobs.
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing
About 80 per cent of the land area of Scotland
is devoted to agriculture. Output of Scottish
agriculture in 1996 was over £2,000 million, of
which two-thirds came from livestock and
livestock products. The principal crop is
barley, which is used in the making of whisky.
Scotland accounts for over half of Britain’s
forest area and for just under half of timber
production. Forestry is continuing to expand
and many new woodlands are being created,
including native pine forests. In the last ten
years there has been significant international
and local investment in timber panel
production and in pulp and paper processing.
Fishing is important, particularly in the
north east and the islands. Scotland accounts
for over 60 per cent by value of the fish landed
in Britain by British vessels.
Energy and Water Resources
Offshore oil and gas production continues to
make a significant contribution to the
economy, and production has been increasing.
Nuclear and hydro-electric generation supply
a higher proportion of electricity than in any
other part of Britain.
With abundant rainfall, there is an
extensive supply of water from upland
sources. Three public water authorities are
responsible for water and sewerage services.
A review of the structure of the industry is in
progress, examining a range of options
designed to strengthen local democratic
control and improve efficiency.
Transport
The roads programme is being reviewed as
part of the Government’s plans to develop an
integrated transport policy (see chapter 19). A
White Paper on transport in Scotland is
planned for early 1998.
The current road construction programme
includes completion of the Central Scotland
motorway network and of the upgrading to
motorway standard of the A74 from Carlisle to
Glasgow. A bridge linking the Scottish
mainland to the island of Skye was opened in
1995 and is one of the world’s longest span
balanced cantilever bridges.
Natural Heritage
Scotland’s countryside contains a rich variety of
wildlife, with some species not found elsewhere
in Britain. There are 70 National Nature
Reserves and 1,400 Sites of Special Scientific
Interest. Four regional parks and 40 National
Scenic Areas cover 13 per cent of the land
surface. Five of the 17 forest parks in Great
Britain are in Scotland, and a sixth spans the
border between Scotland and England.
Over 100 sites have been identified as
possible Special Areas of Conservation under
the European Community (EC) Habitats
Directive. Under the EC’s Wild Birds
Directive, 77 sites have been classified as
Special Protection Areas because of their
importance to rare and migratory birds.
Housing and Urban Regeneration
In Scotland a much higher proportion of
housing is rented from the public sector—
around 30 per cent—than in Britain as a
whole (19 per cent). Home ownership is
increasing but, at just under 60 per cent, is
still lower than in most other areas of Britain.
In 12 Priority Partnership Areas and 11
Regeneration Programme Areas regeneration
partnerships have been set up to tackle the
causes of social and economic decline:
unemployment, crime, poor housing and a
degraded environment. Each partnership
comprises the local council, Scottish Homes,
the appropriate LEG, other relevant agencies
and representatives from the private sector,
the community and the voluntary sector (see
p. 375).

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Health
Although life expectancy has increased,
Scotland’s health record is not as good as
elsewhere in Britain or other industrialised
countries. A range of initiatives has been
introduced to improve the situation, such as
reducing smoking and alcohol misuse, and
improving diet and exercise levels. In July
1997 three priority areas were set for the
National Health Service in Scotland in
1997-98: mental health, cancer, and coronary
heart disease/strokes.
Education
The Scottish education system has a number
of distinctive features (see chapter 26). Three
of the 13 universities—St Andrews, Glasgow
and Aberdeen—were established in the 15th
century, and Edinburgh was founded in the
16th century. Record numbers of students are
now entering higher education.
A new University of the Highlands and
Islands is planned, bringing together a
network of further education colleges. A grant
of £33 million from the Millennium
Commission (see p. 47), together with
government funding of over £15 million, is
contributing towards the project’s
development.
Raising education standards in schools is a
key government priority. In June 1997 the
Early Intervention Programme, a series of
measures costing £24 million, was announced
with the intention of improving standards of
reading, writing and numeracy for children
aged 5 and 6. A new system of courses and
awards for education after 16, ‘Higher Still’,
is to be introduced in 1999.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin, is
spoken by some 70,000 people, many of whom
live in the islands of the Hebrides. Government
support for Gaelic covers three main areas:
education, Gaelic organisations and television
broadcasting.
The annual Edinburgh International
Festival is one of the world’s leading cultural
events. Held in August, it brings about £70
million into the Scottish economy each year,
and is the largest arts festival in Britain.
Scotland possesses several major collections of
the fine and applied arts, such as the Burrell
Collection in Glasgow and the Scottish
National Gallery of Modern Art, in Edinburgh.
A new Museum of Scotland is being built in
Edinburgh to house the National Museums’
Scottish collection. Each spring, Edinburgh
hosts the International Science Festival, the
world’s biggest science festival in a single city.
The predominant Church of Scotland is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in
form. It is governed by a hierarchy of church
courts, each of which includes lay people.
The sport of golf originated in Scotland, and
there are over 400 golf courses, including St
Andrews, Gleneagles, Turnberry, Muirfield,
Troon and Prestwick, which are internationally
renowned. Many other outdoor activities, such
as mountaineering, hill walking and fishing, are
also pursued. Winter sports are increasingly
popular in the Cairngorm Mountains, Glencoe
and elsewhere.

Two-thirds of the population of Wales live in the southern valleys and the
lower-lying coastal areas. The chief urban centres are Cardiff (with a
population of 315,000), Swansea and Newport in the south and Wrexham in the
north. Much of Wales is hilly or mountainous. The highest peak is Snowdon
(1,085 m, 3,560 ft). The Welsh name of the country is Cymru.
The Government is proposing to create a new democratically elected
Assembly for Wales. A referendum in September 1997 approved this by a
majority of 6,700. Wales will continue to have full representation in the
Parliament at Westminster in London.
Early History
After the collapse of Roman rule in Britain
(see p. 2), Wales remained a Celtic stronghold,
although often during Norman times within
the English sphere of influence. In 1282
Edward I completed a successful campaign to
bring Wales under English rule. The series of
great castles that he built in north Wales
remain among Britain’s finest historic
monuments (see p. 369). Edward Ps eldest
son—later Edward II—was born at
Caernarfon in 1284 and was given the title
Prince of Wales, which continues to be borne
by the eldest son of the reigning monarch.
Continued strong Welsh national feeling
culminated in the unsuccessful rising led by
Owain Glyndwr at the beginning of the 15th
century. The Tudor dynasty, which ruled
England from 1485 to 1603, was of Welsh
ancestry. The Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542
united England and Wales administratively,
politically and legally.
Devolution
Since the mid-1960s, when the Welsh Office
and the office of Secretary of State for
Wales were established, greater
administrative responsibility has been
devolved to Wales. The Secretary of State
has responsibility for a range of public
services, which are funded from an annual
budget of nearly £7,000 million. Services
are run by the Welsh Office and through
local authorities, health authorities and non-
departmental public bodies.
The Government’s view is that the
people of Wales will benefit by having an
elected body and that this will be better
placed to promote economic prosperity and

an improved quality of life across Wales. A
White Paper published in July 1997 set out
the Government’s proposals for devolution,
involving the creation of a directly elected
Assembly for Wales.
A referendum in September 1997 endorsed
the Government’s proposals by 559,419 (50.3
per cent) to 552,698 (49.7 per cent).
Assembly for Wales
The Government intends to introduce a Bill
before the end of 1997, which would provide
for the establishment of the Assembly.
Electoral System
Elections to the Assembly will be held every
four years, with the first election expected in
May 1999. Electors will have two votes: one
for a candidate in their local constituency and
one for a party list. The Assembly will have 60
elected members, of whom 40 will be elected
from local constituencies (which will be the
same as the House of Commons
constituencies). The remaining 20—four for
each of the five European parliamentary
constituencies—will be elected by the
additional member system of proportional
representation.
Functions
The Assembly will take over virtually all the
functions currently exercised by the Secretary
of State for Wales, in areas such as: economic
28
WALES
development; agriculture, forestry, fisheries
and food; industry and training; education;
local government; health and personal social
services; housing; the environment; planning;
transport and roads; arts, culture and the
Welsh language; the built heritage; and sport
and recreation.
Among the functions that will remain the
sole responsibility of the Government in
London are foreign affairs, defence,
taxation, overall economic policy, social
security and broadcasting. The office of
Secretary of State for Wales will continue,
with a seat in the Cabinet.
The headquarters of the Assembly will be
in Cardiff. It will have powers to make
secondary legislation (see p. 67), be
responsible for setting the policy within which
Welsh public bodies operate, and be able to
issue guidance and directions, for example, to
local authorities and the National Health
Service.
The working arrangements of the Assembly
will comply with the principles of maximum
openness and public accountability. It will
treat the English and Welsh languages equally
in all its work.
The leadership of the Assembly will be
provided by an Executive Committee, made
up of the leaders of each of its subject
committees. It will operate in a way similar to
the Cabinet (see p. 72) and will normally be
formed by members of the Assembly’s
majority party. Regional committees will be
established to ensure the involvement of all
parts of Wales.
The Assembly will work in partnership
with local authorities and other public bodies.
It will be expected to respect the powers of
local government, with the emphasis on local
decisions being taken at a local level. The
Assembly will control non-departmental
public bodies—there are over 80 in Wales,
spending more than £2,000 million a year. In
most cases, it will have powers to reform or
merge them, or to transfer their functions to
itself, or to local authorities.
Economic Development
The Assembly will provide a new economic
agenda for Wales, with distinct policies to
meet the economy’s particular needs. A new
economic development agency will be
established in advance of the Assembly. This
will be an expanded Welsh Development
Agency (see p. 31), incorporating the
Development Board for Rural Wales (see p.
375) and the Land Authority for Wales (see p.
375). The new body will develop partnerships
with the Assembly, local authorities, industry,
Training and Enterprise Councils, further and
higher education bodies, the voluntary sector
and other organisations, and will have a
strengthened regional structure. Business
Connect, the advice and support network for
small and medium-size enterprises in Wales,
will also be strengthened.
Current Government Arrangements
Wales elects 40 Members of Parliament (MPs)
to the House of Commons. Labour has usually
had a majority of seats. In the General
Election in May 1997 it gained seven seats
from the Conservative Party, so that it now
has 34 MPs, with four seats being held by
Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalist) and two by
the Liberal Democrats.
Arrangements for consideration of Welsh
affairs in Parliament include a House of
Commons Select Committee (see p. 68) on
Welsh Affairs and the Welsh Grand
Committee, whose function is to consider
matters relating exclusively to Wales.
Following the creation of the Assembly, the
future of the Committees is likely to be
considered by the House of Commons.
Local government has been reorganised,
and 22 unitary authorities succeeded the two-
tier structure of eight county councils and 37
district councils in 1996.
The legal system is identical to that in
England.
Language
At the time of the 1991 census 19 per cent of
the population said that they spoke Welsh. In
much of the rural north and west, Welsh
remains the first language of most of the
population.
The Government has reaffirmed its
commitment to enhancing Welsh culture and
29
4
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
developing greater use of the Welsh language.
Welsh is compulsory in the National
Curriculum for Wales, and this arrangement
will be fully implemented by 1999. Bilingual
education in schools is encouraged (see p. 32).
Welsh is now more widely used for official
purposes and in broadcasting, while most road
signs are bilingual.
The Welsh Language Act 1993 established
the principle that, in the context of public
business and the administration of justice in
Wales, Welsh and English should be treated
on the basis of equality. The Welsh Language
Board aims to promote and facilitate the use of
the Welsh language; in 1997-98 its gross
expenditure will be over £5.7 million.
In December 1996 the Board published its
strategy for the future of the Welsh language.
Its main priorities include:
• increasing the number of people able to
speak Welsh;
• providing more opportunities to use the
language; and
• strengthening Welsh as a community
language.
Economy
Recent decades have seen fundamental
changes in the Welsh economy. It is now
much less dependent on heavy industry—
coalmining and steelmaking—although
steelmaking remains important, with Wales
accounting for over a third of Britain’s steel

output. The most notable features have been
expansion in service industries and the
development of a more diverse range of
manufacturing industries, including many at
the forefront of technology.
Wales is an important centre for
consumer electronics, information
technology, automotive components,
chemicals and materials, and food and drink.
Around 35,000 people are employed in the
manufacture of optical and electrical
equipment, and over 20,000 in the
automotive components sector, where
annual sales are about £1,700 million.
In the service sector the most marked
growth has been in financial and business
services, and leisure services. Expenditure
by tourists was about £1,900 million in
1996, and the industry employs directly or
indirectly about 100,000 people. The Wales
Tourist Board seeks to develop tourism in
ways which will yield the optimum
economic benefit for the people of Wales.
Although south Wales remains the
principal industrial area, new industries and
firms have been introduced in north-east
Wales and light industry attracted to the
towns in rural mid- and north Wales.
LG of Korea is undertaking a £1,700
million project at Newport, the largest
inward investment scheme into Europe.
It involves the construction of two
factories—one producing
semiconductors and the other wide¬
screen television sets and components.
The first phase should be operational by
the end of 1997. Over 6,100 new jobs are
being directly created, with many
thousands more expected in supporting
industries.
Inward Investment
Wales has been particularly successful in
attracting investment from overseas
companies and from elsewhere in Britain.
Since 1983 the Welsh Development Agency
(WDA) has recorded 1,680 projects,
bringing in total investment of £11,000
million and the creation or safeguarding of
over 160,000 jobs. Overseas-owned
manufacturing companies employ more than
75,000 people.
Economic Development
The economic programmes of the Welsh
Office are complemented by the work of the
WDA and the Development Board for Rural
Wales, which have wide powers to promote
economic, industrial and environmental
change. In 1997—98 these bodies plan to
undertake programmes involving expenditure
of £130 million and £20 million respectively.
One of the main areas of activity is providing
accommodation for business.
The south Wales valleys have been
particularly affected by the decline in
traditional industries. A second five-year
Programme for the Valleys was launched in
1993 to improve the economic, social and
environmental conditions in the area.
The redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay area
is one of the biggest regeneration projects in
Britain. A new bafrage being built across the
harbour mouth should be completed in
October 1998. It is expected that about 29,000
new jobs will be created in the Cardiff Bay
area, 5,900 new homes built, 1.15 million sq m
of business space created and over £1,500
million of private sector investment attracted.
Agriculture and Forestry
Agriculture occupies about 81 per cent of the
land area. The main activities are sheep and
cattle rearing in the hill regions and dairy
farming in the lowlands. About 12 per cent of
Wales is covered by woodland.
Transport
Motorway links to England and the rest of
Europe were considerably improved when the
second motorway bridge crossing the Severn
and associated motorway links were opened in
1996. The bridge, which cost £300 million,
was built and is operated by a private sector
company, Severn River Crossing pic. A
review of the roads programme in Wales is in
31
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
progress, in conjunction with the
development of an integrated transport
policy (see chapter 19).
Ferry services to Ireland operate from
Fishguard, Pembroke Dock and Swansea in
south Wales, and from Holyhead in north
Wales. More than 3.8 million passengers
travelled through these ports in 1996.
Passenger traffic at Cardiff International
Airport has increased from 624,000 in
1990-91 to just over 1 million in 1996-97.
Environment
Wales has a rich and diverse natural heritage.
About one-quarter of Wales is designated as a
National Park or Area of Outstanding Natural
Beauty (see p. 364). As well as three National
Parks—Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and
the Pembrokeshire Coast—and five Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty, there are two
national trails, 31 country parks and large
stretches of heritage coast. There are 56
National Nature Reserves and over 900 Sites of
Special Scientific Interest. In addition, there
are a number of internationally important
nature conservation sites in Wales. There are
36 sites proposed for designation as Special
Areas of Conservation under the European
Community (EC) Habitat Directive, 12 Special
Protection Areas classified under the EC Wild
Birds Directive and eight Ramsar Wetlands of
international importance designated under the
Ramsar Convention (see p. 366).
Cultural and Social Affairs
Welsh literature is one of the oldest in Europe.
The Welsh people have strong musical
traditions and Wales is well known for its
choral singing, while the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation.
Special festivals, known as eisteddfodau,
encourage Welsh literature and music. The
largest is the annual Royal National
Eisteddfod, consisting of competitions in
music, singing, prose and poetry entirely in
Welsh. Artists from all over the world come
to Llangollen for the annual International
Musical Eisteddfod.
An active local press includes several
Welsh language publications. The fourth
television channel, Sianel Pedwar Cymru
(S4C), broadcasts in Welsh during peak
viewing hours and is required to ensure that
a significant proportion of its output is in
Welsh.
A White Paper setting out the
Government’s proposals for raising
standards in schools in Wales was published
in July 1997. In schools Welsh is taught—as
a first or second language—to most pupils
between the ages of 5 and 16. In addition,
subjects are taught in Welsh in about 500
schools, in both the primary and secondary
sectors. The majority of these are in the
traditionally Welsh-speaking, largely rural
areas. However, in recent years there has
also been a significant growth in Welsh-
medium education in other areas where the
dominant language of the community is
English. There are 14 higher education
institutions, of which eight form the
collegiate University of Wales (founded in
1893), and 26 further education colleges.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game. A new national rugby
stadium, costing some j£l 14 million, is being
built in Cardiff. It will host the final of the
1999 Rugby World Cup.

6 The Social Framework
Population 33 Ethnic and National Minorities 38
Language 38 The Economic and Social Pattern 41
Among the main social changes during the second half of the 20th century are
longer life expectancy and a lower birth rate, reflected in a growing proportion of
elderly people; a higher divorce rate; much greater participation by women in the
workforce; wider educational opportunities; and a higher standard of living.
POPULATION
Britain’s population in mid-1996 was
estimated at 58.8 million, the 18th largest in
the world. The population has increased by
over 2.4 million since 1981. On mid-1994-
based projections, it is forecast to rise to 59.5
million in 2001 and 60.5 million in 2011,
reaching a peak of around 61.2 million in the
2020s. Population is likely to start falling from
about 2025, owing to fewer births and an
increase in the number of deaths in the elderly
population—reflecting a peak in births in the
post-war ‘baby boom’.
Birth Rates
In 1996 there were 733,300 live births in
Britain. The total period fertility rate (an
indication of average family size) remains
below 2.1, the level leading to the long-term
replacement of the population, although it is
projected that it will increase from 1.71 in
1995 to 1.8 for women born in or after 1980.
Contributory factors to the relatively low
birth rate in recent years (12.5 live births per
1,000 population in 1996) include:
• the trends towards later marriage and
postponing having children, which have
led to an increase in the average age of
women giving birth—28.6 years in
England and Wales in 1996, compared
with 26.8 in 1981;
• a preference for smaller families than in
the past, which has led to a significant
decline in the proportion of families with
four or more children; and
• more widespread and effective
contraception, making it easier to plan
families, and the greater prevalence of
voluntary sterilisation for both men and
women.
Mortality
At birth the expectation of life for a man in
Britain is now over 74 years and for a woman
nearly 80 years, compared with 49 years for
men and 52 years for women in 1901.
There were 638,900 deaths in 1996, a death
rate of just under 11 per 1,000 population.
There has been a decline in mortality at most
ages, particularly among children. The infant
mortality rate (deaths of children under one
year old per 1,000 live births) was 6.1 in 1996;
neonatal mortality (deaths of infants under
four weeks old per 1,000 live births) was 4.1;
and maternal mortality is about 0.07 per 1,000
total births. The decline in the mortality rate
33
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
reflects many factors, including better
nutrition, rising standards of living, advances
in medical science, better working conditions,
and the smaller size of families.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases
(including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for over two-fifths of all deaths, and
mortality from heart disease remains high
compared with that of other developed
countries. The next largest cause of death is
cancer, which is responsible for around a
quarter of deaths.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest single
cause of preventable illness and death in
Britain, and is associated with around 120,000
deaths each year (nearly a fifth of all deaths).
Smoking has declined among adults—around
29 per cent of adult males and 28 per cent of
adult females smoked cigarettes in 1996,
compared with 52 and 41 per cent respectively
in 1972—although recently there has been an
increase in smoking among children. A survey
conducted in December 1996 for the
Department of Health found that 69 per cent
of smokers would like to stop smoking.
Government action to tackle smoking includes
a proposed ban on tobacco advertising (see
p. 408).
The level of good health varies quite
significantly in some parts of the country
and sections of the community. The
Government is planning to reduce such
inequality and to tackle the underlying
causes of ill health, and it is developing a
new public health strategy (see chapter
24). In addition, an independent review of
the latest available information on health
inequalities and expectation of life in
England will identify priority areas for
future policy development.
Households and Families
The number of households in Great Britain
rose by more than 7 million between 1961 and
1995-96, to 23.5 million. Average household
size fell during this period from 3.1 to 2.4, and
has nearly halved during the 20th century.
Fewer people are living in the traditional
family of a married couple with dependent
children (see Table 6.1), while many more
people are living on their own—12 per cent of
adults-—and 28 per cent of households in
1995-96 comprised one person. The declining
average household size also reflects growth in
the elderly and in lone-parent families, and the
preference for smaller families. Other features
are a big increase in cohabitation, fewer
marriages and higher levels of divorce.

Marriage, Divorce and Cohabitation
Fewer people are getting married, and the
number of marriages—322,200 in 1995 (the
latest year for which information is
available)—has been falling. First marriages,
of which there were 201,000 in 1994, have
declined by nearly a half compared with the
peak reached in 1970. A significant proportion
of marriages—over a third—represent
remarriages of one or both parties.
Separation and divorce have become much
more common in recent decades, and Britain
has the highest divorce rate in the European
Union (EU). In 1995, 170,000 divorces were
granted in Britain. There were 13.4 divorces
for every 1,000 married couples in England
and Wales; divorce rates for Scotland and
Northern Ireland are lower. Nearly three-
34
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
quarters of divorces are granted to wives. The
average age at the time of divorce in England
and Wales is now about 39.6 for men and 37.0
for women. Many divorced people do
eventually remarry, with men more likely than
women to remarry following separation.
As in many other Western European
countries, cohabitation has become much
more common. Between 1981 and 1995-96 the
proportion of non-married women aged 18-49
who were cohabiting doubled, to 25 per cent.
Cohabitation before marriage is increasingly
widespread—around two-thirds of women
who first married in 1993 had cohabited with
their future husband before marriage,
compared with 4 per cent of those first
married in 1966.
Age and Sex Structure
The most significant changes in the age
structure of the population have been the
growing numbers of elderly people and the
decline in the proportion of young people.
Between 1971 and 1995 the proportion of
young people aged under 15 fell from 24.1 per
cent of the population to 19.4 per cent. The
proportion of elderly people (those aged 65
and over) increased from 13.2 to 15.7 per cent,
and the proportion over the normal retirement
ages (60 or 65 years and over for women and
men respectively) grew to 18.2 per cent in
1995. Among the elderly the number aged
over 85 has more than doubled since 1971 and
now exceeds 1 million.
There is a ratio of about 104 females to
every 100 males in the population as a whole.
There are about 3 per cent more male than
female births every year. However, because of
the higher mortality of men at all ages, there is
a turning-point, at about 50 years of age,
beyond which the number of women exceeds
the number of men.
Distribution of Population
The population density is about 243
inhabitants per sq km, which is well above the
EU average of about 116 per sq km. Of the
four lands, England is by far the most densely
populated, with 376 people per sq km.
Scotland is the least densely populated, with
66 people per sq km. Wales and Northern
Ireland have 141 and 123 people per sq km
respectively.
Since the 19th century there has been a
trend for people to move away from congested
urban centres into the suburbs. Between 1981
and 1995 a number of the large urban areas,
such as Manchester, Merseyside, Sheffield,
Glasgow and Dundee, experienced decreases
in population, one of the largest being in
Glasgow (13 per cent). Among the cities
where the population rose in this period were
London, Cardiff and Belfast. The regions with
the highest rates of increase in population
between 1981 and 1995, all in England, were
the South West (10 per cent), South East
(excluding London) and Eastern (8 per cent).
Retirement migration is also a feature of
population movement, the main recipient
areas being the south coast of England and
East Anglia.
International Migration
From 1991 to 1995 some 1.06 million people
left Britain (excluding the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man) to live abroad. About 1.19
million came from overseas to live in Britain, so
that net immigration increased the population
by about 130,000. These figures exclude
migration to and from the Irish Republic, and
are also likely to exclude people admitted as
visitors who were subsequently granted an
extension of stay for a year or more.
In 1995 the total inflow of people intending
to stay in Britain for one year or more was
245,000, while the outflow of people leaving to
live abroad was 192,000 (see Table 6.2).
Nationality
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with Britain;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (see p. 121); and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and

Colonies who did not acquire either of
the other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired automatically
at birth by a child born in Britain if his or her
mother or, if born legitimate, father is a
British citizen or is settled in Britain. A child
adopted in Britain by a British citizen is also a
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in Britain is generally a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the
citizenship of a child born abroad to a British
citizen in Crown service, certain related
services, or in service under a European
Union institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration for certain children,
including those born in Britain who do
not automatically acquire such
citizenship at birth, or who have been
born abroad to a parent who is a citizen
by descent;
• by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in Britain, except for people
from Gibraltar, who may be registered
without residence;
• by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality; and
• by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. Requirements include five years’
residence, or three years if the applicant’s
spouse is a British citizen. Those who are not
married to a British citizen are also required to
have a sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh
or Scottish Gaelic; they must also intend to
have their main home in Britain or be
employed by the Crown, or by an
international organisation of which Britain is a
member, or by a company or association
established in Britain.
Special arrangements covering certain
Hong Kong residents have been made:
• the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act
1990 made provision for the registration
as British citizens before 30 June 1997
(when the territory returned to the
People’s Republic of China—see p. 131)
of up to 50,000 people who were able to
meet certain criteria, together with their
spouses and any children who were still
- minors; and
• the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act
1997 provided for the registration of
solely British nationals after 1 July 1997.
In 1996, 43,154 people were granted British
citizenship.
Immigration
Immigration into Britain is largely governed
by the Immigration Act 1971 and the
Immigration Rules made under it. The Rules
set out the requirements to be met by those
36
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
who are subject to immigration control and
seek entry to, or leave to remain in, Britain.
New Immigration Rules came into effect in
1994. British citizens and those Commonwealth
citizens who had the right of abode before
January 1983 maintain the right of abode and
are not subject to immigration control.
In 1996, 10.3 million foreign and
Commonwealth nationals (excluding nationals
of the European Economic Area—see below)
were admitted to Britain. Some 61,700 people
were accepted for settlement.
Under the Immigration Rules nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial
entities must obtain a visa before they can
enter Britain. Other nationals subject to
immigration control require entry clearance
when coming to work or settle in Britain.
Visas and other entry clearances are normally
obtained from the nearest or other specified
British diplomatic post in a person’s home
country.
Nationals of the European Economic Area
(EEA)—EU member states plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein—are not subject to

New Government Changes
With the intention of making the immigration
system fairer for marriage partners of British
citizens, the new Government has abolished
the ‘primary purpose’ immigration rule
introduced in 1980. Under this, a person
wanting to marry a British citizen was refused
entry to Britain if it was judged by an
immigration officer that the primary purpose
of the marriage was to settle in Britain. The
rule was abolished in June 1997. The
Government has stated that it considers that
the rule penalised genuine marriages, divided
families, and unnecessarily increased the
administrative burden on the immigration
system, and that its abolition will enable
resources to be better focused on the other
requirements regulating the entry of spouses
to Britain.
In addition, work is in progress for a scheme
to control unscrupulous immigration advisers.
Asylum
Britain has traditionally granted asylum to
those fleeing persecution and respects its
obligations under the United Nations
Convention and Protocol relating to the Status
of Refugees. These provide that refugees
lawfully resident should enjoy treatment at
least as favourable as that accorded to the
indigenous population. In recent years there
has been a significant change in both the
numbers and the motivation of those seeking
asylum in Britain, with many asylum seekers
apparently motivated by economic rather than
political factors. Between 1984 and 1995 the
number of asylum seekers rose from 4,000 to
55,000 (including dependants); of whom only
6 per cent were accepted as being genuine
refugees. However, in 1996 the total fell to
3,700, following the withdrawal of entitlement
to social welfare benefits from those who claim
asylum after entering Britain (see chapter 25).
In common with other European countries,
37
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Britain has also reviewed its procedures. The
Asylum and Immigration Act 1996,
introduced under the previous Government,
created the power to designate countries of
destination as not generally giving rise to a
serious risk of persecution. It made appeals
against return to EU, and certain other, safe
third countries exercisable only after removal
from Britain; and made it a criminal offence
for an employer to employ someone who does
not have permission to reside or work in
Britain.
In 1996, 38,960 asylum decisions were made,
of which around 6 per cent were grants of
asylum. The main nationalities applying for .
asylum were people from Nigeria, India,
Somalia, Pakistan, Turkey, and countries
formerly part of the Soviet Union.
In August 1997 the new Government
announced details of an inter-departmental
study of the asylum process. The study will look
at all aspects of the process across government,
including the provision of accommodation and
support to asylum seekers. The aim is to
identify more effective arrangements for
handling asylum claims and the provision of
support consistent with the Government’s
commitment to ensure swift and fair decisions
on asylum cases and to meet its obligations
under the United Nations Convention. In
addition, a Special Immigration Appeals Bill is
before Parliament. Its main provisions are to
provide a right of appeal for individuals liable to
deportation on grounds of national security; and
to set up a new body with decision-making
powers to consider such appeals.
LANGUAGE
English is the main language spoken in
Britain, and is also one of the most widely
used in the world.'Recent estimates suggest
that 310 million people speak it as their first
language, with a similar number speaking it as
a second language. It is an official language in
a large number of overseas countries, and is
widely used internationally as the main
language for purposes such as air traffic
control, international maritime
communications and academic gatherings.
1 For the Welsh language see p. 29; for Gaelic see p. 26.
Modern English derives primarily from one
of the dialects of Old English (or Anglo-
Saxon), itself made up of several Western
Germanic dialects taken to Britain in the early
5th century. However, it has been very greatly
influenced by other languages, particularly
Latin, the language of learning and religion
from the time of Old English and, following
the Norman conquest, by French, the
language of court, government and the
nobility for many years after 1066. The re-
emergence of English as the standard language
of England was signified by such events as the
Statute of Pleading in 1362, which laid down
that English was to replace French as the
language of law. The 14th century saw the
first major English literature since Anglo-
Saxon days, with works such as Piers Plowman
by William Langland and the Canterbury Tales
by Geoffrey Chaucer. However, there
remained great regional variations in the
language, and spellings were not always
standardised.
Following the introduction of the printing
press to England by William Caxton in the late
15th century, there was a considerable
flowering of English literature in the 16th and
early 17th centuries. William Shakespeare,
Edmund Spenser and Christopher Marlowe
produced work that is still famous today.
Cranmer’s prayerbook and the Authorised
(‘King James’) Version of the Bible, which
have had a profound effect on literature down
to modern times, also date from this period.
About this time, too, translations of Latin,
Italian and other European works into English
vastly expanded the English language. The
work of early lexicographers, of whom the
most famous was Samuel Johnson (1709-84),
led to greater standardisation in matters such
as spelling.
ETHNIC AND NATIONAL
MINORITIES
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in Britain, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities.
The Irish have long formed a large section
of the population. Jewish refugees who came
to Britain towards the end of the 19th century
38
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
and in the 1930s were followed by other
European refugees after 1945. Substantial
immigration from the Caribbean and the
South Asian subcontinent date principally
from the 1950s and 1960s, while many people
of Asian descent moved to this country from
eastern Africa. In recent years, the number of
people coming from the South Asian
subcontinent has remained roughly stable, but
there has been a rise in immigration from
some African countries, such as Ghana,
Nigeria and Somalia (see Table 6.3).
The 1991 census included for the first time a
question on ethnic grouping. This found that
94.5 per cent of the population belonged to the
‘White’ group, while just over 3 million people
(5.5 per cent) described themselves as belonging
to another ethnic group (see Table 6.4).
Overall, just under half of the ethnic
minority population was born in Britain. A
higher proportion was under 16 than for the
White group (respectively 33 per cent and 19
per cent), but a much lower proportion was
over pensionable age (respectively 3 per cent
and about 17 per cent).
Members of ethnic minority groups were
heavily concentrated in industrial and urban
areas, and over half lived in the South East,
especially in London. The highest proportion
was in the London borough of Brent: nearly 45
per cent of the local population. Ethnic

minority groups also accounted for over a third
of the population in the London boroughs of
Newham, Tower Hamlets and Hackney.
Outside London the main concentrations were
in Leicester, Slough, Luton, Bradford, the
West Midlands and the Pennine conurbation.
Regional concentrations varied among the
ethnic groups. About three-fifths (60 per cent)
of people from black ethnic groups lived in
London, compared with about two-fifths (41
per cent) of Indians and just under one fifth
(18 per cent) of Pakistanis, who were
concentrated in other metropolitan areas such
as the West Midlands and West Yorkshire.
According to the Labour Force Survey (see
chapter 12), in 1996:
• 2.1 million people of working age (6 per
cent) belonged to ethnic minority groups.
• Economic activity rates varied widely
between ethnic groups; these variations
were greatest among women. In 1996,
working age White and Black Caribbean
women had economic activity rates of 73
per cent compared with 22-24 per cent
for Bangladeshi and Pakistani women
(who also had the lowest employment
rates at 17 per cent).
• Ethnic minority groups had lower
employment rates than the White
population and higher unemployment rates
for both men and women but the variation
between rates for minority groups was
greater than that between White rates and
the closest minority groups.
• The unemployment rates for Black
African (28 per cent) and Pakistani men
(27 per cent) were three times that for
White men (9 per cent). Black African
(24 per cent) and Pakistani (30 per cent)
women had unemployment rates four
times that of White women (6 per cent).
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the Black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made over the last 20 years in tackling
racial disadvantage in Britain.
39
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Many individuals have achieved distinction
in their careers and in public life, and the
proportion of ethnic minority members
occupying professional and managerial
positions is increasing. There are at present
nine Black and Asian Members of Parliament,
and the number of ethnic minority councillors
in local government is growing. There has also
been an expansion of commercial enterprise,
and there are numerous self-help projects in
ethnic minority communities. Black
competitors have represented Britain in a
range of sports (such as athletics, cricket and
football), and ethnic minority talents in the
arts and in entertainment have increasingly
been recognised.
Economic, environmental, educational and
health programmes of central government and
local authorities exist to combat disadvantage.
There are also special allocations, mainly
through grants from the Home Office and
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions, which channel extra
resources into projects of specific benefit to
ethnic minorities. These include, for example,
the provision of specialist teachers for children
needing English language tuition. Cultural
and recreational schemes and the health and
personal social services also take account of the
particular needs of ethnic minorities.
The Government is promoting equal
opportunities for ethnic minorities through
training programmes, including greater
provision for unemployed people who need
training in English as a second language. A
Race Relations Forum is to be set up to advise
on the issues affecting ethnic minority
communities.
Race Relations Legislation
The Race Relations Act 1976, which applies to
England, Scotland and Wales, strengthened
previous legislation passed in the 1960s. It
makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national
origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, in housing, in
education and in advertising. The 1976 Act
also gave complainants direct access to civil
courts and, for employment complaints, to
industrial tribunals. It is a criminal offence to
incite racial hatred under the provisions of the
Public Order Act 1986.
Parallel legislation was introduced for
Northern Ireland in August 1997.
In order to protect ethnic minority
communities from intimidation, the
Government proposes to create a new offence
of racial harassment and a new crime of
racially motivated violence. It also proposes to
introduce court orders which prohibit named
individuals from harassing the community at
large, including racially motivated harassment.
A consultation paper is to be issued shortly
and a Crime and Disorder Bill will be
published later in 1997.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality was
established by the 1976 Act. It has power to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices
and to issue non-discrimination notices
requiring such practices to cease. It has an
important educational role and has issued
codes of practice in employment, education,
healthcare, maternity services and housing. It
also provides advice to the general public
about the Race Relations Act and may help
individuals with their complaints about racial
discrimination. In 1996 the Commission
registered 1,750 applications for assistance and
successfully handled 142 litigation cases (this
includes 101 cases settled on terms, and 41
successful after hearing). It can also undertake
or fund research.
The Commission supports the work of 84
racial equality councils. These are autonomous
voluntary bodies set up in most areas with a
significant ethnic minority population to
promote equality of opportunity and good
relations at the local level. The Commission
helps pay the salaries of officers employed by
the racial equality councils, most of whom also
receive funds from their local authorities. It
also gives grants to ethnic minority self-help
groups and to other projects run by or for the
benefit of the minority communities.
A Commission for Racial Equality for
Northern Ireland was established in August
1997, with powers similar to that for England,
Wales and Scotland.

THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
PATTERN
Marked improvements in the standard of
living have taken place during the 20th
century. According to a United Nations report
on human development published in 1997,
Britain ranked 15th out of 175 countries on a
human development index that combines life
expectancy, education levels and basic
purchasing power. Britain’s gross domestic
product (GDP) per head is around the average
for the 15 EU nations.
Income and Wealth
Wages and salaries remain the main source of
household income for most people, although
the proportion they contribute has declined,
from 68 per cent in 1971 to 56 per cent in
1995. During this period income from private
Despite the rise in real wealth, inequalities
remain in income and in areas such as
health. The gap between those with high
and low incomes has tended to grow over
time, especially during the 1980s, although
during the 1990s this gap has stabilised. In
August 1997 the Government announced
the establishment of a Social Exclusion
Unit in the Cabinet Office to draw up a
strategy for tackling problems of poverty,
homelessness, public health and crime.
pensions and annuities has more than
doubled, to 11 per cent of household income
in 1995, partly as a result of the growing
number of elderly people and the increased
likelihood of them having occupational
pensions. In 1995 other main sources of
household income included self-employment

1996-97
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
(10 per cent), rent, dividend and interest
payments (7 per cent) and social security
benefits (13 per cent). Direct taxes and social
security contributions consume a lower
proportion of personal income than in most
other G7 countries.
The value of wealth held by the personal
sector in Britain was £2,830,000 million in
1995. Investment in life assurance and pension
funds accounted for 34 per cent, double the
proportion in 1981. The proportion of wealth
in dwellings declined rapidly during the
1990s, to 26 per cent in 1995, reflecting
substantial falls in house prices. Nevertheless,
a large proportion of households—67 per
cent—own their own homes. About two-fifths
of these households own their property
outright, while the remainder have a
mortgage.
Wealth is less evenly distributed than
income, with the richest 10 per cent of the
population having 48 per cent of marketable
wealth in 1993. The inclusion of‘non-
marketable’ wealth, such as rights in
occupational and state pension schemes,
reduces this share substantially, to 33 per cent.
The proportion of net wealth held in

of the adult population in Great Britain—
owned shares, but this has increased
considerably during 1997 as a result of the
conversion of five large building societies to
banks (see chapter 16).
Eating and Drinking Habits
The general level of nutrition remains high.
There has been a significant shift in eating
patterns over the last decade, reflecting greater
emphasis on health, frozen and convenience
foods. Changes in household consumption of
selected foods between 1986 and 1996 are
shown in the diagram on p. 42. Consumption
of several items, such as sugar, eggs, fresh
potatoes and fresh green vegetables, has
declined substantially. Other changes include:
• a long-term decline in consumption of
red meats—beef, lamb and pork—while
at the same time consumption of poultry
has been rising;
• a rise in fish consumption, accompanied
by a switch away from fresh white fish
towards fat fish, canned fish and
shellfish;
• an increase in purchases of semi-
skimmed milks, with skimmed milk now
constituting more than half of the total
household consumption of liquid milk;
• a decline in the total consumption of
cooking and spreading fats, with large
falls in butter and lard usage being partly
offset by rapid rises in the consumption
of vegetable and salad oils and low and
reduced-fat spreads;
• a long-term rise in consumption of fresh
fruit, such as bananas; and
• a large increase in fruit juice
consumption.
In 1996 there was a particularly large fall in
beef and veal consumption, of over 16 per
cent, reflecting concern over the safety of
eating beef (see p. 280).
Average mineral and nutrient intakes are
generally above the daily amounts
recommended by the Department of Health.
Health considerations appear to be influencing
food consumption, for example, in the fall in
red meat sales, the move away from whole
milk and the growth in low fat spread
consumption.
There has been an increase in the number
of meals eaten away from home, for example,
in restaurants or at work, and a growth in the
consumption of food from ‘take-away’ and
‘fast food’ shops.
Alcohol consumption has changed little in
recent years, although it rose by about 5 per
cent in 1996. Beer is the most popular drink
among male drinkers, whose overall
consumption is significantly higher than that
of women. A high proportion of beer is drunk
in public houses (‘pubs’), traditional social
centres for many people, and in clubs. Lager is
estimated to account for over half of all beer
sales. The largest consumers of alcohol are
those aged 18 to 24, with consumption
generally declining with age. Consumption of
table wine has grown, although there has been
a slight decline in the consumption of higher
strength wines such as sherry and port.
Women
The economic and domestic lives of women
have been transformed in the 20th century,
partly as a result of women obtaining many
political and legal rights previously open only to
men. The growth of part-time and flexible
working patterns has allowed more women to
combine raising a family with paid employment.
Women now make up around 46 per cent of the
workforce in employment, with about 850,000
running their own businesses. However, women
are still under-represented in some occupations
and at senior levels. For example, fewer than 5
per cent of company directors are-women.
The Government supports ‘Opportunity
2000’, an employer-led initiative to increase
the participation of women in the workforce
and to promote family-friendly employment
policies. Membership stands at over 300
employers, with organisations employing
about a quarter of the workforce being
committed to the campaign.
Responsibility for co-ordinating
government policy lies with the two Ministers
for Women (one of whom is the Secretary of
State for Social Security) and a Cabinet Sub¬
committee on Women’s Issues. This is chaired
by the Secretary of State for Social Security.
43
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
At the May 1997 General Election the
number of women MPs nearly doubled to
120: 101 Labour, 13 Conservative, three
Liberal Democrat, two Scottish National
Party and the Speaker. Women’s
representation at ministerial level in the
Government is now at a record level, with
five women in the Cabinet and 17 other
women ministers.
The Government is seeking to improve
communications with women’s organisations.
It has launched a review of the Women’s
National Commission, which has traditionally
been the mechanism for consultation and
communication between the Government and
women’s organisations. About 50 of the main
national women’s organisations are
represented on the Commission. The review
aims to ensure that there is a strong,
independent organisation suitable for the 21st
century.
The Government wants women to make
their full contribution to the economy and to
improve the living standards and quality of life
of their families. It is taking action in a
number of areas to enable more women to join
or rejoin the labour force, including:
• launching the New Deal for Lone
Parents in a number of areas in July
1997—it will be available throughout the
country in October 1998. It is part of the
Welfare-to-Work programme (see p.173),
and is intended to help more lone parents
(the vast majority of whom are women)
to get back to work by giving them
jobsearch help and advice and training,
and help with childcare. Lone parents
whose youngest child has reached school
age will get help and advice on jobsearch,
training and childcare from a personal
adviser;
• promoting family-friendly employment
policies, which enable women to balance
successfully their home and work
commitments;
• changing the benefits system to help
those in work who are on low incomes to
pay for childcare (see p. 429);
• providing funding through the National
Lottery for out-of-school activities for
children; and
• helping to increase the supply of
childcare, through voluntary
organisations training more people under
the New Deal for young people (see p.
173).
The Government is developing a National
Childcare Strategy, which will help to ensure
that sufficient childcare places are available to
match the requirements of the labour market.
This will extend the Out of School Childcare
Initiative, which offers parents with children
of school age the chance to participate more
fully in the labour market; around 74,000
childcare places in Great Britain are available
under the initiative
The Ministers for Women are also co¬
ordinating work on tackling violence against
women.
The Government is also taking steps to
ensure that women’s concerns are at the centre
of policy-making, and that women’s
perspectives are automatically considered
when policy is formulated.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination between men and women
unlawful, with certain limited exceptions, in
employment, education, training and the
provision of housing, goods, facilities and
services. Discriminatory job recruitment
advertisements are unlawful. Complaints of
discrimination concerning employment are
dealt with by industrial tribunals; other
complaints are taken before county courts in
England and Wales or the Sheriff Court in
Scotland. Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, as
amended in 1984, women in Great Britain are
entitled to equal pay with men when doing
work that is the same or broadly similar, work
which is rated as equivalent, or work which is
of equal value. Parallel legislation on sex
discrimination and equal pay applies in
Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC), an independent statutory body, has
the duties of working towards the elimination
44
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
of sex discrimination and promoting equality
of opportunity. The EOC may advise people
of their rights under the Acts and may give
assistance to help individuals conduct a case.
It is empowered to carry out formal
investigations and issue notices requiring
discriminatory practices to stop. The EOC
runs an ‘Equality Exchange’, with around 500
members, which enables employers to
exchange information on good practice.
The Voluntary Sector
There is a long tradition in Britain of
voluntary service to the community.
Hundreds of thousands of voluntary
organisations exist, ranging from national
bodies to small local groups. Voluntary
organisations may be staffed by professional
workers, but most rely on the efforts of
volunteers at some level. It has been estimated
that up to half of all adults take part in some
form of organised voluntary work in the
course of a year. Many volunteers are involved
in work which improves the quality of life in
their local communities or, more widely, give
their time to help organise events or groups in
areas as diverse as social welfare, education,
sport, heritage and the arts. A very large
number of volunteers are involved in activities
to protect or improve the environment,
working, for example, for the National Trust,
which has over 2 million members (see p. 368).
The Government greatly values the
voluntary sector’s contribution to society and,
as a result, is keen to encourage productive
partnerships between the statutory and
voluntary sectors. For example, voluntary
organisations are important providers of
government-supported employment and
training services for unemployed people.
‘Make a Difference’ Initiative
The Voluntary and Community Unit within
the Home Office2 co-ordinates government
policy towards the voluntary sector
throughout Britain. It also aims to support a
! In May 1997 responsibility for the voluntary sector was
transferred from the former Department of National Heritage to
the Home Office.
healthy and cost-effective voluntary sector and
to promote volunteering throughout the
community. The ‘Make a Difference’ initiative,
launched in 1994, brought together the
business, voluntary and public sectors to
promote volunteering.
Government funding in 1996-97 has
included grants of £2.3 million to help
existing volunteer bureaux increase their
effectiveness, while £2.5 million has been
given to complete a network of local volunteer
development agencies. These agencies provide
a focus for volunteering in localities where
there is at present no volunteer bureau.
Funding
Voluntary organisations receive income from
several sources, including
• contributions from individuals,
businesses and trusts;
• central and local government grants;
• earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
• fees from central and local government
for those services which are provided on
a contractual basis.
In 1994—95 direct grants to voluntary
organisations from government amounted to
£957 million.
Charities currently benefit from tax reliefs
worth £1,700 million. These consist of about
£1,000 million direct tax relief, £200 million
VAT relief, and the balance on relief from
business rates. Tax changes in recent budgets
have helped the voluntary sector secure more
funds from industry and individuals. The Gift
Aid scheme provides tax relief on single cash
donations of at least £250. Under the Payroll
Giving scheme, employees can also make tax-
free donations to charity from their earnings.
A review of the taxation of charities was
announced in July 1997. A consultation paper
will be published in spring 1998.
Charities
In England and Wales over 181,800 charities
are registered with the Charity Commission, a
non-ministerial government department.
Their combined income is around £18,000
45
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
million. Over 70 per cent of those registered
had a recorded income of under £10,000. The
Commission also gives advice to trustees of
charities on their administration and checks
abuse. Organisations may qualify for
charitable status if they are established for
exclusively charitable purposes such as the
relief of poverty, the advancement of
education or religion, or the promotion of
certain other purposes of public benefit.
These may include good community relations,
the prevention of racial discrimination, the
protection of health and the promotion of
equal opportunity. The Charity Commission
also has a statutory responsibility to ensure
that charities make effective use of their
resources.
Recent legislation has strengthened the
Commissioners’ power to investigate and
supervise charities. For example, new
measures to protect charities and donors from
bogus fund-raisers came into force in 1995,
while a new framework for charity accounts
and reports came into force in 1996.
The introduction of the National Lottery
(see p. 47) has given charities and voluntary
organisations new opportunities to secure
substantial new funding for projects across a
range of activities. By October 1997 the
National Lottery Charities Board, which
distributes the portion of the proceeds of the
National Lottery allocated to charities, had
made over 11,000 grants totalling over £680
million. The Board’s aim is to give grants to
support organisations which help meet the
needs of those in society at greatest
disadvantage, and to improve the quality of
life in the community.
The Charities Aid Foundation, an
independent body, is one of the main
organisations aiding the flow of funds to
charity from individuals, companies and
grant-making trusts.
Umbrella Organisations
The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations is one of the main co-ordinating
bodies in England, providing close links
between voluntary organisations, government
departments, local authorities, the European
Commission and the private sector; around
1,000 national voluntary organisations are
members. It also protects the interests and
independence of voluntary agencies, and
provides them with advice, information and

and Northern Ireland perform similar
functions. The National Association of
Councils for Voluntary Service is another
umbrella organisation, which has a
membership of over 230 local Councils for
Voluntary Service (CVS), covering both urban
and rural areas of England. CVS are local
voluntary organisations set up and run by local
groups to support, promote and develop local
voluntary action.
National Lottery
Launched in 1994, the National Lottery has
become the biggest lottery in the world. About
95 per cent of adults have participated and
nearly 70 per cent regularly buy tickets.
Lottery ticket sales amounted to £4,720
million in 1996—97. Tickets or scratchcards
are available from almost 35,500 retail outlets.
In February 1997 a new mid-week draw
was introduced, supplementing the weekly
draw on Saturdays. Ticket sales have
subsequently risen by around 30 per cent.
Saturday sales are now running at between
£60 million and £70 million, while the mid¬
week draw attracts sales of between £27
million and £30 million. Weekly sales of
scratchcards are over £16 million.
Camelot Group pic, a private sector
consortium, has the franchise to run the
Lottery until 2001. The Lottery is regulated
by the Director General of the National
Lottery, who heads the Office of the National
Lottery (‘OFLOT’).
Large sums have already been raised for
good causes by the Lottery—£3,065 million
up to February 1997. By 2001 it is expected to
have generated at least £10,000 million for
good causes, around £1,000 million more than
originally forecast. The proceeds from the
Lottery are distributed as follows:
• 50 per cent for prizes;
• 28 per cent for good causes, one of the
highest proportions allocated for this
purpose by any national lottery;
• 12 per cent for National Lottery duty;
• 5 per cent for retailers’ commission; and
• 5 per cent for operating costs and profit.
Awards
Nearly 28,000 projects have received awards
since the launch of the Lottery. Awards are
distributed to five good causes: sport,
charities, the arts, heritage and projects to
mark the millennium. Each receives one-fifth
of the money generated for good causes.
There are a number of large-value schemes,
but over half the awards have been for less
than £50,000.
Millennium Projects
The Millennium Commission is supporting
projects which mark the end of the second
millennium and the start of the third. By July
1997 the Commission had awarded £993
million to 111 capital projects. It is also
supporting the New Millennium Experience at
Greenwich in London (see p. 371), a
Millennium Festival in 2000, and a Millennium
Awards scheme designed to help individuals—
13 voluntary and other organisations have
become partners under the scheme and up to
8,000 individuals are expected to benefit from
projects announced so far.
Among the 14 ‘landmark’ projects
supported are:
• the Odyssey Project, providing a mixture
of education, entertainment and sporting
activities in Belfast;
• the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff (see
p. 527);
• the Millennium Seed Bank, at the Royal
Botanic Gardens (see p. 342);
• a National Space Science Centre, in
Leicester; and
• a new Tate Gallery of Modern Art in
London (see p. 483).
Planned Changes
In July 1997 the Government issued a White
Paper containing its plans to reform the
Lottery. A Bill will be introduced into
Parliament later in 1997.
A sixth good cause—the New Opportunities
Fund—will support spending on initiatives to
improve education, health and the environment.
47
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
The first three initiatives will involve:
• training and support for Britain’s 500,000
teachers and some 10,000 library staff in
information and communications
technology;
• out-of-school activities, including
homework clubs and creative activities;
and
• a network of healthy living centres.
The Bill will also provide for the
establishment of NESTA—the National
Endowment for Science, Technology and the
Arts. NESTA, an independent trust, will help
talented individuals to develop their full
potential in the creative industries, science and
technology; help to turn ideas into products or
services which are effectively exploited; and
contribute to the advance of public education
about, and awareness and appreciation of,
these subjects. The Government believes that
NESTA should have a particular focus on
multimedia and other areas where the arts and
science and technology meet.
Various measures are proposed to improve
the distribution of Lottery funding to good
causes, for example, by ensuring a more
strategic approach and that money is allocated
fairly across all regions of Britain and among
different groups in society.
The Government wishes to introduce a new
system for operating the Lottery when the
current licence expires in 2001. It is inviting
proposals for a system based on the objectives
of maximising the return to good causes and
removing unnecessary profit margins. A
new panel will assist the Director General
of OFLOT in selecting the Lottery
operator.
Leisure Trends
Nearly 16 per cent of total household
expenditure went on leisure goods and services
in 1996-97. The most common leisure
activities are home-based, or social, such as
visiting relatives or friends. Television viewing
is by far the most popular leisure pastime, and
nearly all households have one television set or
more. Average viewing time is over 25 hours a
week. Around 82 per cent of households now
have at least one video recorder, compared
with 30 per cent in 1985.
Listening to radio has been increasing, and
averages over 10 hours a week. Purchases of
compact discs have risen very rapidly, and since
1992 have exceeded the sales of audio cassettes.
The proportion of households with a compact
disc player has grown considerably, from 15 per
cent in 1989 to 59 per cent in 1996-97.
Ownership of some other consumer durable
goods, such as microwave ovens and home
computers, has also been rising significantly.
Other popular pursuits include: reading,
do-it-yourself home improvements, gardening
and going out for a meal, for a drink or to the
cinema. About half of households have a pet.
Cats have overtaken dogs to become the most
popular type of pet—the latest estimates being
7.2 million and 6.6 million respectively.
Holidays
In 1996, 58 per cent of the adult population
took at least one long holiday of four or more
nights away from home. The number of long
holidays taken by British residents was 54
million, of which 31 million were taken in
Britain. The most frequented free attraction
was Blackpool Pleasure Beach (Lancashire),
with an estimated 7.5 million visitors in 1996.
The most popular holiday destinations are the
West Country, Scotland, the south of England
and Wales.
In 1996 the most visited destinations for
overseas holidays of one night or more by
British residents were:
• Spain (28 per cent);
• France (9 per cent);
• the United States (8 per cent); and
• Greece (6 per cent).
British residents took 23 million long
holidays overseas in 1996, of which 57 per cent
involved ‘package’ arrangements. About 70
per cent of all holidays abroad are taken in
Europe, although many people take holidays
further afield, for example to the United
States, the Far East or Australia. The
proportion of adults taking two or more
holidays of four or more nights in 1996 was 24
per cent.

The system of parliamentary government in Britain is not based on a written
constitution, but is the result of gradual evolution over many centuries. The
Monarchy is the oldest institution of government, dating back to at least the
ninth century. Parliament is one of the oldest representative assemblies in the
world, the House of Lords and the House of Commons both having medieval
origins. The new Labour administration has held referendums in Scotland and
Wales which have confirmed popular demand for devolving power from the
Westminster Parliament to a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly; and a
referendum in London on setting up a city-wide authority and directly elected
mayor is planned. Other major proposals include incorporating the European
Convention on Human Rights into domestic law; increasing the openness of
government through a Freedom of Information Act; modernising the procedures
of the House of Commons; and reforming the House of Lords.
The Constitution
The British constitution, unlike that of most
other countries, is not set out in any single
document. Instead it is made up of statute law,
common law and conventions. (Conventions
are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as
indispensable to the working of government.)
The constitution can be altered by Act of
Parliament, or by general agreement, and is
thus adaptable to changing political conditions.
The organs of government overlap but can
be clearly distinguished:
Parliament is the legislature and the supreme
authority. The executive consists of: the
Government—the Cabinet and other ministers
responsible for national policies; government
departments and agencies, responsible for
national administration; local authorities,
responsible for many local services; public
corporations, responsible for operating
particular nationalised industries; independent
bodies responsible for regulating the privatised
industries; or other bodies, subject to
ministerial control.
The judiciary (see chapter 8) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
Origins of Government
The origins of government in Britain are to be
found in each of its four component parts:
50
GOVERNMENT
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. England was united as a kingdom
over a thousand years ago, and Wales became
part of the kingdom during the Middle Ages
(see p. 27). The thrones of England and
Scotland were dynastically united in 1603, and
in 1707 legislation passed in the two countries
provided for the establishment of a single
Parliament of Great Britain with supreme
authority both in England and Wales and in
Scotland (see p. 21). Ireland had had links
with the kingdom of England since the 13th
century, and in 1800 the creation of the
United Kingdom was completed by a union
joining the Irish Parliament to that of Great
Britain (see p. 13). In 1922 Southern Ireland
(now the Irish Republic) became an entirely
separate and self-governing country. The six
counties of Northern Ireland had been given
their own subordinate Parliament in 1920, and
voted to remain within the United Kingdom.
The British Parliament at Westminster in
London—with an elected chamber comprising
members from English, Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland constituencies—thus
represents people sharing very varied
backgrounds and traditions. It has ultimate
authority for government and law-making, but
administrative arrangements have developed
in such a way as to take account of the
particular needs of different areas.
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and Northern
Ireland Affairs
England and Wales on the one hand and
Scotland on the other have different systems
of law, a different judiciary, different
education systems, different systems of local
government and, for most domestic matters,
different government departments. Wales has
its own language and cultural traditions. In
Scotland, departments are grouped under a
Secretary of State—a Cabinet minister with a
ministerial team—who has responsibility in
Scotland for a wide range of policy matters.
He is head of The Scottish Office, with
headquarters in Edinburgh and an office in
London (see p. 536). The distinctive
conditions and needs of Scotland and its
people are also reflected in separate Scottish
legislation on many domestic matters. In the
administration of Welsh affairs there is already
a considerable measure of devolution under a
Secretary of State, who is also a member of the
Cabinet, with a ministerial team (for further
details see p. 537.) The Secretary of State’s
department, the Welsh Office, is based in
Cardiff with branches throughout Wales and a
small ministerial office in London.
The British Government assumed direct
responsibility for Northern Ireland from the
Northern Ireland Parliament in 1972 (see p.
14), and since then the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, with a seat in the Cabinet,
has been in charge of the Northern Ireland
Office. Assisted by a ministerial team, the
Secretary of State has overall responsibility for
the government of Northern Ireland and is
directly responsible for political and
constitutional matters, security policy and
broad economic questions and other major
policy issues.
Proposals for Devolution
Legislation was passed in July 1997 to allow
the people of Scotland and Wales to vote in
separate referendums (held in September
1997), on proposals to devolve power from
Parliament at Westminster to a Scottish
Parliament (see p. 22) and a Welsh Assembly
(see p. 28). Following the endorsement of the
proposals in each referendum, the
Government is to introduce legislation before
the end of 1997 to implement the devolution
settlements.
The Scottish Parliament would have law¬
making powers, including defined and limited
financial powers to vary revenue. It would
extend democratic control over the
responsibilities currently exercised by the
Scottish Office. The Welsh Assembly would
provide democratic control over the existing
Welsh Office functions. It would have
secondary legislative powers and would be able
to reform and control the non-departmental
public bodies (NDPBs—see p. 74) in Wales.
The Scottish and Welsh bodies would each be
elected by both a simple majority system and a
form of proportional representation.
The responsibilities of the Westminster
Parliament would remain unchanged over
economic, defence and foreign policy.

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
Proposed Code of Human Rights
The Government is to publish a White Paper
in autumn 1997 on proposals to enact a Code
of Rights which would incorporate the
European Convention on Human Rights into
domestic law. This would enable people in
Britain to secure decisions on their human
rights from British courts and not just from
the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg.
At present Britain is virtually alone among
the major nations of Western Europe in that
there is no direct means for its citizens to assert
their Convention rights through their national
courts. British courts can only take the
Convention into account in certain limited
circumstances, and when any breach of the
Convention is found by the European Court in
Strasbourg, courts in Britain are bound to
amend domestic laws and procedures to make
good the breach and to prevent a recurrence. In
the Government’s view, incorporation of the
Convention would increase the judges’ powers
to protect the individual against the abuse of
power by the State.
For the first time judges would be given a
framework by Parliament within which to
interpret the law. Incorporation would make
Convention rights accessible in British courts
at every level, making them British rights and
not just European rights.
The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. Queen Elizabeth II is herself
directly descended from King Egbert, who
united England under his rule in 829. The only
interruption in the history of the Monarchy was
the republic, which lasted from 1649 to 1660.
Today the Queen is not only Head of State,
but also a symbol of national unity. The
Queen’s title in Britain is: ‘Elizabeth the
Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland and of Her other Realms and
Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man
the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor.
The Commonwealth
Although the seat of the Monarchy is in
Britain, the Queen is also head of state of a
number of Commonwealth states.1 In each
such state the Queen is represented by a
Governor-General, appointed by her on the
advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and completely independent of the
British Government.
In British Dependent Territories (see
p. 121) the Queen is usually represented by
governors, who are responsible to the British
Government for the administration of the
countries concerned.
Succession
The title to the Crown is derived partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has always been
preserved.
Sons of the Sovereign have precedence over
daughters in succeeding to the throne. When a
daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen
Regnant, and has the same powers as a king.
The consort of a king takes her husband’s rank
and style, becoming Queen. The constitution
does not give any special rank or privileges to
the husband of a Queen Regnant.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700, only
Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia, the
Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of
James I of England and VI of Scotland) are
eligible to succeed. The order of succession
can be altered only by common consent of the
countries of the Commonwealth of which the
Queen is Sovereign.
Accession
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as soon
as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interregnum. He or she is at once proclaimed
at an Accession Council, to which all members
1 The other Commonwealth states of which the Queen is head of
state are: Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; Bahamas; Barbados;
Belize; Canada; Grenada; Jamaica; New Zealand; Papua New
Guinea; St Christopher and Nevis; Saint Lucia; St Vincent and
the Grenadines; Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.

of the Privy Council (see p. 55) are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and
Temporal (see p. 58), the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen and other leading citizens of the
City of London are also invited.
Coronation
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony takes place at Westminster Abbey in
London, in the presence of representatives of
the Houses of Parliament and of all the great
public organisations in Britain. The Prime
Ministers and leading members of the other
Commonwealth nations and representatives of
other countries also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she is
head of the executive, an integral part of the
legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of
the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of the
established Church of England. As a result of
a long process of evolution, during which the
Monarchy’s absolute power has been
progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the
advice of her ministers. Britain is governed by
Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the
Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to ministers, the Queen
still takes part in some important acts of
government. These include summoning,
proroguing (discontinuing until the next
session without dissolution) and dissolving
Parliament; and giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by Parliament. The Queen also
formally appoints many important office
holders, including the Prime Minister and
other government ministers (see p. 63),
judges, officers in the armed forces,
governors, diplomats, bishops and some other
senior clergy of the Church of England. She is
also involved in pardoning people convicted of
crimes; and in conferring peerages,
knighthoods and other honours.2 In
international affairs the Queen, as Head of
State, has the power to declare war and make
peace, to recognise foreign states and
governments, to conclude treaties and to
annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use of
‘royal prerogative’ powers are now performed
by government ministers, who are responsible
to Parliament and can be questioned about
particular policies. Parliamentary authority is
not required for the exercise of these
prerogative powers, although Parliament may
restrict or abolish such rights.
The Queen continues to play a role in the
working of government. She holds Privy
Council meetings, gives audiences to her
ministers and officials in Britain and overseas,
receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She must be
consulted on every aspect of national life, and
must show complete impartiality.
Provision has been made to appoint a
regent to perform these royal functions should
the Queen be totally incapacitated. The regent
would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
Wales, then those, in order of succession to
the throne, aged 18 or over. In the event of her
partial incapacity or absence abroad, the
Queen may delegate certain royal functions to
the Counsellors of State (her husband, the
Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in
line of succession, and the Queen Mother).
However, Counsellors of State may not, for
instance, dissolve Parliament (except on the
Queen’s instructions), or create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with
the British monarchy, and many traditional
ceremonies continue to take place. Royal
marriages and funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch
2 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice
of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her personally—the
Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit
and the Royal Victorian Order.
54
GOVERNMENT
or head of state visits Britain and investitures
are held at Buckingham Palace and the Palace
of Holyroodhouse in Scotland to bestow
honours.
Each year the Queen and other members of
the Royal Family visit many parts of Britain.
They are also closely involved in the work of
many charities. For example, the Prince of
Wales is actively involved in The Prince’s
Trust, set up to encourage small firms and
self-employment in inner cities, while the
Princess Royal is President of the Save the
Children Fund. The Queen pays state visits to
foreign governments, accompanied by the
Duke of Edinburgh. She also tours the other
countries of the Commonwealth. Other
members of the Royal Family pay official
visits overseas, occasionally representing the
Queen.
Royal Income and Expenditure
Until 1760 the Sovereign had to provide for
payment of all government expenses,
including the salaries of officials and the
expenses of the royal palaces and households.
These were met from hereditary revenues,
mainly income from Crown lands, and income
from some other sources granted to the
Monarch by Parliament. The income from
these sources eventually proved inadequate
and in 1760 George III turned over to the
Government most of the hereditary revenue.
In return he received an annual grant (Civil
List), from which he continued to pay royal
expenditure of a personal character, the
salaries of government officials, the costs of
royal palaces, and certain pensions. The last
three categories were removed from the Civil
List in 1830.
Present Arrangements
Today the expenditure incurred by the
Queen in carrying out her public duties is
financed from the Civil List and from
government departments, which meet the cost
of, for example, the Royal Yacht and the
aircraft of No 32 (The Royal) Squadron. All
such expenditure is approved by Parliament.
In 1991 Civil List payments were fixed at
£7.9 million a year for ten years. About three-
quarters of the Queen’s Civil List provision is
required to meet the cost of staff. The Queen’s
private expenditure as Sovereign is met from
the Privy Purse, which is financed mainly
from the revenue of the Duchy of Lancaster;3
her expenditure as a private individual is met
from her own personal resources.
Under the Civil List Acts, other members
of the Royal Family also receive annual
parliamentary allowances to enable them to
carry out their public duties. The Prince of
Wales, however, receives no such allowance,
since as Duke of Cornwall he is entitled to the
income of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall.
Each year the Queen refunds the Government
for all parliamentary allowances paid to
members of the royal family except the Queen
Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid
income tax on all personal income and on that
part of the Privy Purse income which is used
for private purposes. The Queen also pays tax
on any realised capital gains on her private
investments and on the private proportion of
assets in the Privy Purse. Inheritance tax will
not, however, apply to transfers from one
sovereign to his or her successor, although any
personal bequests other than to the successor
will be subject to inheritance tax. In line with
these changes the Prince of Wales pays income
tax on the income from the Duchy of
Cornwall so far as it is used for private
purposes.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins can be traced back to the King’s Court,
which assisted the Norman monarchs in
running the government. As the system of
Cabinet government developed in the 18th
century, however, much of the role of the
Privy Council was assumed by the Cabinet,
although the Council retained certain
executive functions. Some government
3 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has
always been enjoyed by the reigning sovereign. It is kept quite
apart from his or her other possessions and is separately
administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
55
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
departments originated as committees of the
Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen on the approval
of Orders in Council, which are made both
under prerogative powers, such as Orders
approving the grant of Royal Charters of
incorporation and under statutory powers.
Responsibility for each Order, however, rests
with the minister answerable for the policy
concerned, regardless of whether he or she is
present at the meeting where approval is
given.
The Privy Council also advises the
Sovereign on the issue of royal proclamations,
such as those summoning or dissolving
Parliament. The Council’s own statutory
responsibilities, which are independent of the
powers of the Sovereign in Council, include
supervising the registration authorities of the
medical and allied professions.
Membership of the Council, with the style
of‘Right Honourable’, is retained for life,
except for very occasional removals. It is
accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister to
people eminent in public life—mainly
politicians and judges—in Britain and the
Commonwealth realms. Cabinet ministers
must be Privy Counsellors and, if not already
members, are admitted to membership before
taking their oath of office at a meeting of the
Council. There are about 470 Privy
Counsellors. A full Council is summoned only
on the accession of a new Sovereign or when
the Sovereign announces his or her intention
to marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees. These include prerogative
committees, such as those dealing with
legislation from the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man, and with applications for charters
of incorporation. Committees may also be
provided for by statute, such as those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the
Scottish universities. Membership of such
committees is confined to members of the
current administration. The only exceptions
are the members of the Judicial Committee
and the members of any committee for which
specific provision authorises a wider
membership.
Administrative work is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the President of
the Council, a Cabinet minister.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is primarily the final court of appeal
for British dependent territories and those
independent Commonwealth countries which
have retained this avenue of appeal after
independence. The Committee also hears
appeals from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, and from the disciplinary and health
committees of the medical and allied
professions. It has a limited jurisdiction to
hear certain ecclesiastical appeals. In 1996 the
Judicial Committee heard 85 appeals and 99
petitions for special leave to appeal.
The members of the Judicial Committee
include the Lord Chancellor, the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, other Privy Counsellors
who hold or have held high judicial office and
certain judges from the Commonwealth.
Parliament
Origins of Parliament
The medieval kings were expected to meet all
royal expenses, private and public, out of their
own revenue. If extra resources were needed
for an emergency, such as a war, the Sovereign
would seek to persuade his barons, in the
Great Council—a gathering of leading men
which met several times a year—to grant aid.
During the 13th century several English kings
found the private revenues and baronial aids
insufficient to meet the expenses of
government. They therefore summoned not
only the great feudal magnates but also
representatives of counties, cities and towns,
primarily to get their assent to extraordinary
taxation. In this way the Great Council came
to include those who were summoned by
name (those who, broadly speaking, were to
form the House of Lords) and those who were
representatives of communities—the
commons. The two parts, together with the
Sovereign, became known as ‘Parliament’ (the
term originally meant a meeting for parley or
discussion).
56
GOVERNMENT
Over the course of time the commons began
to realise the strength of their position. By the
middle of the 14th century the formula had
appeared which in substance was the same as
that used nowadays in voting supplies to the
Crown—that is, money to the government—
namely, ‘by the Commons with the advice of the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal’. In 1407 Henry
IV pledged that henceforth all money grants
should be approved by the House of Commons
before being considered by the Lords.
A similar advance was made in the
legislative field. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the assent of his
councillors. Starting with the right of
individual commoners to present petitions, the
Commons gained the right to submit
collective petitions. During the 15th century
they gained the right to participate in giving
their requests—their ‘Bills’—the form of law.
The subsequent development of the power
of the House of Commons was built upon
these foundations. The constitutional
developments of the 17th century led to
Parliament securing its position as the
supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three elements which make up Parliament
—the Sovereign, the House of Lords and the
elected House of Commons—are constituted
on different principles. They meet together
only on occasions of symbolic significance
such as the State opening of Parliament, when
the Commons are summoned by the
Sovereign to the House of Lords. The
agreement of all three elements is normally
required for legislation, but that of the
Sovereign is given as a matter of course.
Parliament can legislate for Britain as a whole,
or for any part of the country. It can also
legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, which are Crown dependencies and
not part of Britain. They have local
legislatures which make laws on island affairs
(see p. 1).
As there are no legal restraints imposed by
a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases, subject to Britain’s
obligations as a member of the European
Union. It can make or change any law, and
overturn established conventions or turn them
into law. It can even prolong its own life
beyond the normal period without consulting
the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The House
of Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and in this century the House of
Lords has recognised the supremacy of the
elected chamber. The system of party
government helps to ensure that Parliament
legislates with its responsibility to the
electorate in mind.
The European Union
As a member of the European Union, Britain
recognises the various types of Community
legislation and wider policies. It sends 87
elected members to the European Parliament
(see chapter 9).
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide, by voting for taxation, the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is
also informed before important international
treaties and agreements are ratified. The
making of treaties is, however, a royal
prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but in practice General Elections are
57
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
usually held before the end of this term. The
maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Parliament is dissolved and
writs for a General Election are ordered by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime
Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
sessions. Each usually lasts for one year—
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ at night,
at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and the late
Spring Bank Holiday, and during a long
summer break usually starting in late July.
The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a
session is about 157 in the House of Commons
and about 140 in the House of Lords. At the
start of each session the Sovereign’s speech to
Parliament outlines the Government’s policies
and proposed legislative programme. Each
session is ended by prorogation. Parliament
then ‘stands prorogued’ for about a week until
the new session opens. Prorogation brings to
an end nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The Lords
Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, the Bishops of London, Durham
and Winchester, and the 21 next most senior
diocesan bishops of the Church of England.
The Lords Temporal consist of:
• all hereditary peers of England, Scotland,
Great Britain and the United Kingdom
(but not peers of Ireland);
• life peers created to assist the House in its
judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or ‘law
lords);4 and
• all other life peers.
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in the
House provided holders establish their claim
and are aged 21 years or over. However, anyone
4 The House of Lords is the final court of appeal for civil cases in
Britain and for criminal cases in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months
of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or
her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to sit
in the House but gain the right to vote and
stand as candidates at parliamentary elections.
When a disclaimant dies, the peerage passes on
down the family in the usual way.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other walks
of life or because one of the political parties
wishes to have the recipient in the House of
Lords. The House also provides a place in
Parliament for people who offer useful advice,
but do not wish to be involved in party politics.
Peers who attend the House (the average
daily attendance is about 380) receive no salary
for their parliamentary work, but can claim for
expenses incurred in attending the House (for
which there are maximum daily rates) and
certain travelling expenses.
In August 1997 there were 1,223 members
of the House of Lords, including the two
archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords
Temporal consisted of 752 hereditary peers
who had succeeded to their titles, 10
hereditary peers who had had their titles
conferred on them (including the Prince of
Wales), and 435 life peers, of whom 26 were
‘law lords’. There were 86 women peers.
The total potential membership of the
House is reduced by about 60 by a scheme
which allows peers who do not wish to attend
to apply for leave of absence for the duration of
a Parliament. In addition some hereditary peers
do not receive a writ of summons entitling
them to sit in the House, for example, because
they have not established their claim to succeed
or because they are minors; there were 74 such
peers in August 1997.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his or her place on the
woolsack5 as ex-officio Speaker of the House.
• The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion stuffed with
wool from several Commonwealth countries; it is a tradition
dating from the medieval period, when wool was the chief source
of the country’s wealth.
58
GOVERNMENT
In the Lord Chancellor’s absence, his or her
place is taken by a deputy. The first of the
deputy speakers is the Chairman of
Committees, who is appointed at the
beginning of each session and normally chairs
Committees of the Whole House and some
domestic committees.
As Clerk of the House of Lords, the Clerk
of the Parliaments is responsible for the
records of proceedings of the House of Lords
and for the text of Acts of Parliament. He or
she is the accounting officer for the House,
and is in charge of the administrative staff of
the House, known as the Parliament Office.
The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,
usually known as ‘Black Rod’, is responsible
for security, accommodation and services in
the House of Lords’ part of the Palace of
Westminster.
Proposals for Reform
The new Government intends to introduce
legislation to end the right of hereditary peers
to sit and vote in the House of Lords. This is
intended to be the first stage in a process of
reform to make the House of Lords more
democratic and representative. The legislative
powers of the Lords will remain unaltered.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage (see below) and
consists of 659 Members of Parliament (MPs).
In June 1997 there were 120 women and 9
MPs from ethnic minorities. Of the 659 seats,
529 are for England, 40 for Wales, 72 for
Scotland, and 18 for Northern Ireland.
General Elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Sovereign. When an MP
dies or resigns,6 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary (from 1 April 1997 to 31 March
1998) of £43,860 and an office costs allowance
(from April 1997) of up to £47,568. Other
allowances include travel allowances, a

applying for an office under the Crown as Crown Steward or Bailiff
of the Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of the Manor of Northstead.
supplement for London members and, for
provincial members, subsistence allowances
and allowances for second homes. (For
ministers’ salaries see p. 72.)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is
the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside over
the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two deputy
chairmen, who act as Deputy Speakers. They
are elected by the House on the nomination of
the Government but are drawn from the
Opposition as well as the government party.
They, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote
other than in their official capacity.
Responsibility for the administration of the
House rests with the House of Commons
Commission, a statutory body chaired by the
Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker on
the House’s privileges and procedures. The
Clerk’s other responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant at Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
certain orders of the House. He is also the
official housekeeper of the Commons’ part of
the building, and is responsible for security.
Other officers serve the House in the Library,
the Department of the Official Report
{Hansard), the Finance and Administration
Department, and the Refreshment
Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes Britain is divided into
constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons. To ensure
that constituency electorates are kept roughly
equal, four permanent Parliamentary
Boundary Commissions, one each for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, keep constituencies under review.
They recommend any adjustment of seats that
may seem necessary in the light of population
59
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
movements or other changes. Reviews are
conducted every 8 to 12 years. The
recommendations in the Commissions’ last
general reviews were approved by Parliament
in 1995.
Voters
British citizens, together with citizens of other
Commonwealth countries and citizens of the
Irish Republic resident in Britain, may vote
provided they are:
• aged 18 or over;
• included in the annual register of electors
for the constituency; and
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote.
People not entitled to vote include young
people under 18, members of the House of
Lords, foreign nationals (other than
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of the Irish
Republic), some patients detained under
mental health legislation, sentenced prisoners
and people convicted within the previous five
years of corrupt or illegal election practices.
Members of the armed forces, Crown servants
and staff of the British Council employed
overseas (together with their wives or
husbands if accompanying them) may be
registered for an address in the constituency
where they would live but for their service.
British citizens living abroad may apply to
register as electors for a period of up to 20
years after they have left Britain.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. Electors whose
circumstances on polling day are such that they
cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person
at their local polling station—for example,
electors away on holiday—may apply for an
absent vote at a particular election. Electors
who are physically incapacitated or unable to
vote in person because of the nature of their
work or because they have moved to a new area
may apply for an indefinite absent vote. People
entitled to an absent vote may vote by post or
by proxy, although postal ballot papers cannot
be sent to addresses outside Britain.
Voting is not compulsory; 71.5 per cent of a
total electorate of 44.2 million people voted in
the General Election in May 1997. The simple
majority system of voting is used. Candidates
are elected if they have more votes than any of
the other candidates (although not necessarily
an absolute majority over all other candidates).
The Government which took office in May
1997 proposes to hold a referendum on the
voting system for the House of Commons. It
plans to appoint an independent commission
to recommend a proportional representation
alternative to the present first-past-the-post
system.
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts;
people who have been sentenced to more than
one year’s imprisonment; clergy of the Church
of England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church; peers;
and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act
1975.
A candidate’s nomination for election must
be proposed and seconded by two electors
registered as voters in the constituency and
signed by eight other electors. Candidates do
not have to be backed by a political party. A
candidate must also deposit £500, which is
returned if he or she receives 5 per cent or
more of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend
on a general election campaign is £4,965 plus
4.2 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 5.6 pence for each elector in a
county constituency. Higher limits have been
set for by-elections in order to reflect the fact
that they are often regarded as tests of national
opinion in the period between General
Elections. The maximum sum is £19,863 plus
16.9 pence for each elector in borough seats,
and 22.2 pence for each elector in county
seats. A candidate may post an election
communication to each elector in the
constituency, free of charge. All election

expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to the statutory
maximum.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is an
essential element in the working of the
constitution. The present system depends
upon the existence of organised political
parties, each of which presents its policies to
the electorate for approval. The parties are not
registered nor formally recognised in law, but
in practice most candidates in elections, and
almost all winning candidates, belong to one of
the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly two-
party system has existed. Since 1945 either the
Conservative Party, whose origins go back to
the 18th century, or the Labour Party, which
emerged in the last decade of the 19th century,
has held power. A new party—the Liberal
Democrats—was formed in 1988 when the
Liberal Party, which traced its origins to the
18th century, merged with the Social
Democratic Party, formed in 1981. Other
parties include two nationalist parties, Plaid
Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the
Scottish National Party (founded in 1934).

The General Election of 1 May 1997
The May 1997 general election was
notable in a number of ways:
• The Labour Party’s 13.5 million
votes have been exceeded only in
1951, and the party’s share of 43.2 per
cent of the vote is its highest since
1966. The 418 seats won are the
party’s largest number ever, and
compare with 393 won in 1945.
• The Conservative Party’s 9.6 million
votes are its fewest since 1929, and its
share of 30.7 per cent of the vote, the
lowest since 1832. The 165 seats won
are its smallest number since 1906.
The Conservatives won no seats in
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
• The Liberal Democrats’ 5.2 million
votes are fewer than in 1992, as is the
party’s share of the total vote, but the
46 seats won represents the party’s
highest number since 1929, when it
won 56 as the Liberal Party.
• Turnout at the election was relatively
low, at 71.5 per cent—the lowest
national level of turnout since 1935
(see Table 7.2).
• A record number of women were
elected in 1997. In all 120 women
MPs were returned, double the
number in 1992. Of the new women
MPs, 101 are Labour, 13
Conservative, 3 Liberal Democrat,
twro SNP and one is the Speaker.
62
- GOVERNMENT
Northern Ireland has a number of parties.
They include the Ulster Unionist Party,
formed in the early part of this century; the
Democratic Unionist Party, founded in 1971
by a group which broke away from the Ulster
Unionists; Social Democratic and Labour
Party, founded in 1970, and Sinn Fein.7
Since 1945 eight General Elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and seven
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a General
Election, or which has the support of a
majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually forms the Government. By
tradition, the leader of the majority party is
asked by the Sovereign to form a government.
About 100 of its members in the House of
Commons and the House of Lords receive
ministerial appointments (including
appointment to the Cabinet—see p. 72) on the
advice of the Prime Minister. The largest
minority party becomes the official
Opposition, with its own leader and ‘shadow
cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons with
their supporters (the backbenchers) sitting
behind them. Similar arrangements for the
parties also apply to the House of Lords;
however, a significant number of Lords do not
wish to be associated with any political party,
and sit on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths of
the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however, its
aims are to contribute to the formulation of
policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA.
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
to Government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances of
winning the next General Election.
The detailed arrangements of government
business are settled, under the direction of the
Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two
Houses, by the Government Chief Whips of
each House in consultation with the
Opposition Chief Whips. The Chief Whips
together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often
referred to when the question of finding time
for a particular item of business, is discussed.
The Leaders of the two Houses are
responsible for enabling the Houses to debate
matters about which they are concerned.
Parliamentary party control is exercised by
the Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of backbench
members. Party discipline tends to be less
strong in the Lords than in the Commons,
since Lords have less hope of high office and
no need of party support in elections.
The formal title of the Government Chief
Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury. Of the other
Government Whips, three are officers of the
Royal Household (one of these is Deputy
Chief Whip), five hold titular posts as Lords .
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are
Assistant Whips. The Government Whips in
the Lords hold offices in the Royal
Household; they also act as government
spokesmen.
Financial Assistance to Parties
Annual assistance from public funds helps
opposition parties carry out parliamentary
work at Westminster. In the House of
Commons it is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the previous
General Election or one member elected and a
minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The amount
for the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998
is £3,254 for every seat won at the 1997
63
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
General Election, plus £7.04 f°r every 200
votes. Financial assistance has been provided
to the two main opposition parties in the
House of Lords since 1 October 1996. For the
period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998 the
Conservative Party will receive £102,600 and
the Liberal Democrats £30,780.
The Government intends to introduce
legislation to prohibit foreign donations to
political parties and to oblige political parties
to declare all donations above a minimum
figure.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent, partly codified by each House
in its Standing Orders. The system of debate
is similar in both Houses. Every subject starts
off as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member.
After debate, in which each member may
speak only once, the motion may be
withdrawn: if it is not, the Speaker or
Chairman ‘puts the question’ whether to agree
with the motion or not. The question may be
decided without voting, or by a simple
majority vote. The main difference of
procedure between the two Houses is that the
Speaker or Chairman in the Lords has no
powers of order; instead such matters are
decided by the general feeling of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House and
must guard against the abuse of procedure and
protect minority rights. The Speaker has
discretion on whether to allow a motion to end
discussion so that a matter may be put to the
vote, and has powers to put a stop to
irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to
save time in other ways. In cases of grave
disorder the Speaker can adjourn or suspend
the sitting. The Speaker may order members
who have broken the rules of behaviour of the
House to leave the Chamber or can initiate
their suspension for a period of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In a
tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
without expressing an opinion on the merits of
the question. Voting procedure in the House
of Lords is broadly similar, although the Lord
Chancellor does not have a casting vote.
Modernisation of the House of Commons
A Select Committee on Modernisation of the
House of Commons was set up in June 1997 to
consider how the practices and procedures
should be modernised. Its First Report on the
Legislative Process, issued in July 1997, called
for greater flexibility in the way legislation is
handled, including pre- and post-legislative
scrutiny; proposed that a number of Bills
should be programmed on an experimental
basis, and suggested that it should be possible
in defined circumstances to carry forward Bills
from one session to the next. The Committee
has also modernised the contents and layout of
the Order Paper (the agenda of the House of
Commons). It will now look at other issues,
including the structure of the parliamentary
year, the process for scrutinising European
legislative proposals, and the ability of MPs to
make the Government accountable for its
actions.
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial (and some non-financial) interests.
Members with a financial interest must
declare it when speaking in the House or in
Committee and must indicate it when giving
notice of a question or motion. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings with
other members, ministers or civil servants,
MPs must also disclose any relevant financial
interest. In 1995 the House agreed that
members cannot advocate matters in the
House which are related to the source of any
personal financial interest.
Also in 1995 the House of Lords passed a
Resolution to establish a Register of Lords’
Interests, on lines similar to that for MPs. The
most recent Register was published in February
1997 and is open to public inspection.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
Following recommendations of the Committee
on Standards in Public Life (the Nolan
Committee—see p. 76), the post of
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
was created in 1995. The Commissioner, who
is independent of government, can advise MPs

on matters of standards, and conduct a
preliminary investigation into complaints
about alleged breaches of the rules. The
Commissioner reports to the House of
Commons Select Committee on Standards
and Privileges.
In a report published by the Select
Committee in June 1997,8 the Commissioner,
Sir Gordon Downey, presented his findings
on a number of serious allegations of
misconduct, including the ‘cash for questions’
case, in which a number of MPs and former
ministers in the previous administration were
accused of accepting secret payments in return
for providing lobbying services in the House
of Commons. The report found that the
conduct of five former MPs, three of whom
had been ministers, fell below the standards
expected of Members of Parliament to varying
degrees. It also recommended that the rules
governing the registration of election
donations should be reviewed.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches (transcribed
verbatim in Hansard, the official report) are
published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of
the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of a number
of former members of both Houses, are
available to the public through the House of
Lords Record Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television and
radio, either live or, more usually, in recorded
or edited form. Complete coverage is available
on cable television.
The Law-making Process
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament and
delegated legislation made by ministers under
powers given to them by Act (see p. 67).
While the interpretation of the law undergoes
* Committee on Standards and Privileges: First Report:
Complaints from Mr Mohamed Al Fayed, The Guardian and Others
against 25 Members and Former Members. HC 30-1, The Stationery
Office, 1997.
constant refinement in the courts (see p. 87),
changes to statute law are made by
Parliament.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Proposals for legislation affecting the
powers of particular bodies (such as individual
local authorities) or the rights of individuals
(such as certain proposals relating to railways,
roads and harbours) are known as Private
Bills, and are subject to a special form of
parliamentary procedure. Bills which change
the general law and which constitute the more
significant part of the parliamentary legislative
process are Public Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either
House, by a government minister or by an '
ordinary (‘private’ or ‘backbench’) member.
Most public Bills that become Acts of
Parliament are introduced by a government
minister and are known as ‘Government Bills’.
Bills introduced by other MPs or Lords are
known as ‘Private Members’ Bills’.
The main Bills which constitute the
Government’s legislative programme are
announced in the Queen’s Speech at the State
Opening of Parliament, which usually takes
place in November, and the Bills themselves
are introduced into one or other of the Houses
over the succeeding weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and other agencies
interested in the subject, and with interest and
pressure groups which seek to promote
specific causes. ‘White Papers’, which are
government statements of policy, often
contain proposals for legislative changes; these
may be debated in Parliament before a Bill is
introduced. From time to time consultation
papers, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, set
out government proposals which are still
taking shape and seek comments from the
public.
Passage of Public Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Bills relating mainly to financial
matters are almost invariably introduced in the
Commons. Under the provisions of the
Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of
the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are very
65
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
restricted. The Parliament Acts also provide
for a Bill to be passed by the Commons
without consent of the Lords in certain (very
rare) circumstances.
The process of passing a Public Bill is
similar in each House. On presentation the
Bill is considered, without debate, to have
been read for a first time and is printed. After
an interval, which may be between one day
and several weeks, a Government Bill will
receive its second reading debate, during
which the general principles of the Bill are
discussed.
If it obtains a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill will normally be committed
to a standing committee (see p. 67) for detailed
examination and amendment. In the Lords,
the committee stage usually takes place on the
floor of the House, and this procedure may
also be followed in the Commons if that
House so decides (usually in cases where there
is a need to pass the Bill quickly or where it
raises matters of constitutional importance).
The Commons may also decide to divide the
committee stage of a Bill between a standing
committee and a committee of the whole
House (which is commonly the case with the
annual Finance Bill).
The committee stage is followed by the
report stage (‘consideration’) on the floor of
the House, during which further amendments
may be made. In the Commons, the report
stage is usually followed immediately by the
third reading debate, where the Bill is
reviewed in its final form. In the Lords, a Bill
may be further amended at third reading.
After passing its third reading in one
House, a Bill is sent to the other House, where
it passes through all its stages once more and
where it is, more often than not, further .
amended. Amendments made by the second
House must be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can go for
Royal Assent.
In the Commons the House may vote to
limit the time available for consideration of a
Bill. This is done by passing a ‘timetable’
motion proposed by the Government,
commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. There
are special procedures for Public Bills which
consolidate existing legislation or which enact
private legislation relating to Scotland.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and known as an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been
refused since 1707. In the 1996-97 session 58
Pubic Bills were enacted. (A list of the main
Public Bills receiving Royal Assent since
autumn 1996 is given on p. 538.)
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
Most Government Bills introduced and passed
in the Lords pass through the Commons
without difficulty, but a Lords Bill which was
unacceptable to the Commons would not
become law. The Lords, on the other hand, do
not generally prevent Bills insisted upon by the
Commons from becoming law, though they will
often amend them and return them for further
consideration by the Commons.
By convention, the Lords pass Bills
authorising taxation or national expenditure
without amendment. Under the Parliament
Acts 1911 and 1949, a Bill that deals only with
taxation or expenditure must become law
within one month of being sent to the Lords,
whether or not they agree to it, unless the
Commons directs otherwise. If no agreement
is reached between the two Houses on a non-
financial Commons Bill, the Lords can delay
the Bill for a period which, in practice,
amounts to at least 13 months. Following this
the Bill may be submitted to the Queen for
Royal Assent, provided it has been passed a
second time by the Commons. The Parliament
Acts make one important exception: any Bill
to lengthen the life of a Parliament requires
the full assent of both Houses.
The limits to the power of the Lords,
contained in the Parliament Acts, are based on
the belief that nowadays the main legislative
function of the non-elected House is to act as a
chamber of revision, complementing but not
rivalling the elected House.
Private Members’ Bills
Early in each session backbench members of
the Commons ballot (draw lots) for the
66
GOVERNMENT
opportunity to introduce a Bill on one of the
Fridays during the session on which such Bills
have precedence over government business.
The first 20 members whose names are drawn
win this privilege, but it does not guarantee
that their Bills will pass into law. Members
may also present a Bill on any day without
debate, and on most Tuesdays and
Wednesdays on which the Commons is sitting
there is also an opportunity to seek leave to
present a Bill under the ‘ten minute rule’.
This provides an opportunity for a brief
speech by the member proposing the Bill (and
by one who opposes it).
Few of these Bills make further progress or
receive any debate, but in most sessions some
do become law (22 in the 1996-97 session).
Recent examples include the Proceeds of Crime
(Scotland) Act 1995, the Energy Conservation
Act 1996 and the Confiscation of Alcohol
(Young Persons) Act 1997. Private Members’
Bills do not often call for the expenditure of
public money; but if they do they cannot
proceed to committee stage unless the
Government decides to provide the necessary
money. Peers may introduce Private Members’
Bills in the Plouse of Lords at any time. A
Private Member’s Bill passed by either House
will not proceed in the other House unless
taken up by a member of that House.
Private and Hybrid Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to Public
Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. Hybrid Bills are Public Bills
which may affect private rights, for example,
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill which was
passed in 1996. As with Private Bills, the
passage of Hybrid Bills through Parliament is
governed by special procedures which allow
those affected to put their case.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation often
gives ministers or other authorities the power
to regulate administrative details by means of
secondary or ‘delegated’ legislation. To
minimise any risk that delegating powers to
the executive might undermine the authority
of Parliament, such powers are normally
delegated only to authorities directly
accountable to Parliament. Moreover, Acts of
Parliament which delegate such powers usually
provide for some measure of direct
parliamentary control over proposed delegated
legislation, by giving Parliament the
opportunity to affirm or annul it. Certain Acts
also require that organisations affected must be
consulted before rules and orders can be made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House as a whole. The House of Lords has
appointed a delegated powers scrutiny
committee which examines the
appropriateness of the powers to make
secondary legislation in Bills.
Parliamentary Committees
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a Committee of the Whole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or Lord may
speak only once on each motion does not apply
in committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider Public Bills at the
committee stage. The committee considers the
Bill clause by clause, and may amend it before
reporting it back to the House. Ordinary
standing committees do not have names but
are referred to simply as Standing Committee
A, B, C, and so on; a new set of members is
appointed to them to consider each Bill. Each
committee has between 16 and 50 members,
with a party balance reflecting as far as
possible that in the House as a whole. The
Committees of the Whole House
67
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
standing committees include two Scottish
standing committees, and the Scottish, Welsh
and Northern Ireland Grand Committees.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish MPs (and may be convened
anywhere in Scotland as well as at
Westminster). It may consider the principle of
any Scottish Bills at the second and third
reading stages, where such a Bill has been
referred to the Committee by the House for
that purpose. It also debates other matters
concerning Scotland. In addition, its business
includes questions tabled for oral answer,
ministerial statements and other debates,
including those on statutory instruments
referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, consisting
of all 40 Welsh MPs and up to five others who
may be added from time to time, considers
Bills referred to it at second reading stage,
questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements, and other matters relating
exclusively to Wales.
The Northern Ireland Grand Committee
considers Bills in relation to their principle at
the second and third stages, takes oral
questions and ministerial statements, and
debates matters relating specifically to
Northern Ireland. It includes all 18 Northern
Ireland MPs and up to 25 others who may be
added from time to time.
In addition there is a Standing Committee on
Regional Affairs, consisting of all Members
sitting for consitituencies in England, plus up to
5 others. It has not met, however, since 1977.
There are also standing committees to
debate proposed European legislation, and to
scrutinise statutory instruments and draft
statutory instruments brought forward by the
Government.
In the Lords, various sorts of committees
on Bills may be used instead of, or as well as, a
Committee of the Whole House. Such
committees include Public Bill Committees,
Special Public Bill Committees, Grand
Committees, Select Committees and Scottish
Select Committees.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed for a
particular task, generally one of enquiry,
investigation and scrutiny. They report their
conclusions and recommendations to the
House as a whole; in many cases their
recommendations invite a response from the
Government, which is also reported to the
House. A select committee may be appointed
for a Parliament, or for a session, or for as long
as it takes to complete its task. To help
Parliament with the control of the executive
by examining aspects of public policy,
expenditure and administration, 16
committees, established by the House of
Commons, examine the work of the main
government departments and their associated
public bodies. The Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, for example, ‘shadows’ the work
of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. The
committees are constituted on a basis which is
in approximate proportion to party strength in
the House.
Other regular Commons select committees
include those on Public Accounts, Standards
and Privileges and European Legislation.
‘Domestic’ select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
To keep the two Houses informed of EU
developments, and to enable them to
scrutinise and debate Union policies and
proposals, there is a select committee in each
House, and two Commons standing
committees debate specific European
legislative proposals. Ministers also make
regular statements about EU business.
In their examination of government
policies, expenditure and administration,
committees may question ministers, civil
servants and interested bodies and individuals.
Through hearings and published reports, they
bring before Parliament and the public an
extensive body of fact and informed opinion
on many issues, and build up considerable
expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees in which the bulk
of the House’s judicial work is transacted,
there are two major select committees: on the
European Community and on Science and
Technology. Ad hoc committees may also be
set up to consider particular issues (or,
sometimes, a particular Bill), and ‘domestic’
committees—as in the Commons—cover the
internal workings of the House.
68
GOVERNMENT
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills1' and
statutory instruments (see p. 67). The two
Houses may also agree to set up joint select
committees on other subjects.
Unofficial Party Committees
The Parliamentary Labour Party comprises all
members of the party in both Houses. When
the Labour Party is in office, a parliamentary
committee, half of whose members are elected
and half of whom are government
representatives, acts as a channel of
communication between the Government and
its backbenchers in both Houses. When the
party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the direction
of an elected parliamentary committee, which
acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in the
House of Commons. When the Conservative
Party is in office, ministers attend its meetings
by invitation and not by right. When the party
is in opposition, the whole membership of the
party may attend meetings. The then leader
appoints a consultative committee, which acts
as the party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
In addition to the system of scrutiny by select
committees, both Houses offer a number of
opportunities for the examination of
government policy by both the Opposition
and the Government’s own backbenchers. In
the House of Commons, the opportunities
include:
1. Question Time, when for 55 minutes on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’
questions. The Prime Minister’s Question
Time takes place for one half hour every
Wednesday when the House is sitting.
A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts into
one, with the aim of simplifying the statutes.
Parliamentary questions are one means of
seeking information about the
Government’s intentions. They are also a
way of raising grievances brought to MPs’
notice by constituents. MPs may also put
questions to ministers for written answer;
the questions and answers are published
in Hansard. There are some 50,000
questions every year.
2. Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the House
to raise constituency cases or matters of
public concern. There is a half-hour
adjournment period at the end of the
business of the day, and opportunities for
several adjournment debates on
Wednesday mornings. In addition, an MP
wishing to discuss a ‘specific and
important matter that should have urgent
consideration’ may, at the end of Question
Time, seek leave to move the
adjournment of the House. On the very
few occasions when leave is obtained, the
matter is debated for three hours in what
is known as an emergency debate, usually
on the following day.
3. Early day motions (EDMs) provide a
further opportunity for backbench MPs to
express their views on particular issues. A
number of EDMs are tabled each sitting-
day; they are very rarely debated but can
be useful in gauging the degree of support
for the topic by the number of signatures
of other MPs which the motion attracts.
4. The 20 Opposition days each session,
when the Opposition can choose subjects
for debate. Of these days, 17 are at the
disposal of the Leader of the Opposition
and three at the disposal of the second
largest opposition party.
5. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government
expenditure, chosen by the Liaison
Committee (a select committee largely
made up of select committee chairmen,
which considers general matters relating
to the work of select committees).
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the
Government also arise during the debate on
the Queen’s Speech at the beginning of each
session; during debates on motions of censure
69
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
for which the Government provides time; and
during debates on the Government’s
legislative and other proposals.
House of Lords
Similar opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
Question Time, during debates and by means
of questions for written answer.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons,
in overseeing the revenue of the State and
public expenditure, are to authorise the raising
of taxes and duties, and the various objects of
expenditure and the sum to be spent on each.
It also has to satisfy itself that the sums
granted are spent only for the purposes which
Parliament intended. No payment out of the
central government’s public funds can be
made, and no taxation or loans authorised,
except by Act of Parliament. However, limited
interim payments can be made from the
Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important of
the annual statutes, and authorises the raising
of revenue. The legislation is based on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement. This includes a review of the public
finances of the previous year, and proposals
for future expenditure (see p. 157). Scrutiny
of public expenditure is carried out by House
of Commons select committees (see p. 68).
The Commons' Ability to Force the Government
to Resign
The final control is the ability of the House of
Commons to force the Government to resign
by passing a resolution of‘no confidence’. The
Government must also resign if the House
rejects a proposal which the Government
considers so vital to its policy that it has
declared it a ‘matter of confidence’ or if the
House refuses to vote the money required for
the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Ombudsman—officially
known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—investigates complaints from
members of the public (referred through MPs)
alleging that they have suffered injustice
arising from maladministration. The
Ombudsman is independent of government
and reports to a Select Committee of the
House of Commons. The Ombudsman’s
jurisdiction covers central government
departments and agencies and a large number
of non-departmental public bodies. He or she
cannot investigate complaints about
government policy, the content of legislation
or relations with other countries.
In making his investigations, the
Commissioner has access to all departmental
papers, and has powers to summon those from
whom he wishes to take evidence. When an
investigation is completed, he sends a report
with his findings to the MP who referred the
complaint (with a copy report for the
complainant). In reports of justified cases, the
Ombudsman normally recommends that the
department provides redress (which can
include a financial remedy for the complainant
in appropriate cases). There is no appeal
against the Ombudsman’s decision. He
submits an annual report to Parliament, and
also publishes selected cases three times a
year.
In 1996 the Ombudsman received a record
1,920 new complaints (an increase of 12.5 per
cent over the previous year). He completed
260 investigations; of these he found 246
wholly or partly justified and 14 unjustified.
Complaints against the Department of Social
Security accounted for over 47 per cent of the
total received.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman also
monitors the Code of Practice on Access to
Official Information (see p. 75).
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from obstruction
in carrying out its duties. The rights apply
collectively to each House and to its staff and
individually to each member.
70
GOVERNMENT
For the Commons the Speaker formally
claims from the Queen ‘their ancient and
undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; first call on the attendance
of its members, who are therefore free from
arrest in civil actions and exempt from serving
on juries, or being compelled to attend court as
witnesses; and the right of access to the Crown,
which is a collective privilege of the House.
Further privileges include the rights of the
House to control its own proceedings (so that it
is able, for instance, to exclude ‘strangers’10 if it
wishes); to decide upon legal disqualifications
for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and to punish for breach of its
privileges and for contempt. Parliament has the
right to punish anybody, inside or outside the
House, who commits a breach of privilege—
that is, offends against the rights of the House.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the House of
Commons. The law of privilege is to be
examined by a Joint Committee of both Houses
of Parliament.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the conduct of national
affairs. The Prime Minister is appointed by the
Queen, and all other ministers are appointed by
the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime
Minister. Most ministers are members of the
Commons, although the Government is also
fully represented by ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First
Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The Prime Minister’s unique
10 All those who are not members or officials of either House.
position of authority derives from majority
support in the House of Commons and from
the power to appoint and dismiss ministers.
By modern convention, the Prime Minister
always sits in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet (see p. 72), is responsible for the
allocation of functions among ministers and
informs the Queen at regular meetings of the
general business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
Church of England archbishops, bishops and
deans and some 200 other clergy in Crown
‘livings’; senior judges, such as the Lord Chief
Justice; Privy Counsellors; and Lord-
Lieutenants. He or she also recommends
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable
of the Tower, and some university posts; and
appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the BBC (British
Broadcasting Corporation), as well as various
royal and statutory commissions.
Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (to people who have
achieved eminence in science or the arts and
are in financial need). The Prime Minister also
selects the trustees of certain national
museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10
Downing Street (the official residence in
London) has a staff of civil servants who assist
the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister may
also appoint special advisers to the Office to
assist in the formation of policies.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’,
or may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the President of the Council, the
71
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General and,
from time to time, Ministers without
Portfolio, may have few or no departmental
duties. They are thus available to perform any
duties the Prime Minister may wish to give
them. In the present administration, for
example, the President of the Council is
Leader of the House of Commons and the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is
Minister of the Public Service.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, as
both a minister with departmental functions and
the head of the judiciary (see p. 88). The four
Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and
Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor
General; and for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State and Junior Ministers
Ministers of State usually work with ministers
in charge of departments. They normally have
specific responsibilities, and are sometimes
given titles which reflect these functions.
More than- one may work in a department. A
Minister of State may be given a seat in the
Cabinet and be paid accordingly.
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State or, where the
senior minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries) share in
parliamentary and departmental duties. They
may also be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work.
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons range from £23,623 a year for
junior ministers to £60,000 for Cabinet
ministers. In the House of Lords salaries range
from £43,632 for junior ministers to £77,693
for Cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister is
entitled to a salary of 100,000." The Lord
Chancellor receives £140,665.
In addition to their ministerial salaries,
ministers in the Commons, including the
Prime Minister, receive a full parliamentary
salary of £43,860 a year in recognition of their
constituency responsibilities and can claim the
other allowances which are paid to all MPs.
The Leader of the Opposition in the
Commons receives a salary of £55,000 (and in
addition, the full parliamentary salary of
£43,860); two Opposition whips in the
Commons and the Opposition Leader and
Chief Whip in the Lords also receive salaries.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by the
Prime Minister and may include departmental
and non-departmental ministers.
The functions of the Cabinet are to initiate
and decide on policy, the supreme control of
government and the co-ordination of
government departments. The exercise of
these functions is vitally affected by the fact
that the Cabinet is a group of party
representatives, depending upon majority
support in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential. Its members are
bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not
to disclose information about its proceedings,
although after 30 years Cabinet papers may be
made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few hours
each week during parliamentary sittings, and
less often when Parliament is not sitting. To
keep its workload within manageable limits, a
great deal of work is carried on through the
committee system. This involves referring
issues either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee of the ministers
directly concerned. The committee then
considers the matter in detail and either
disposes of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet
with recommendations for action.
11 The Prime Minister has declined the full salary to which he is
entitled; he draws instead a salary of £58,557. Similarly, Cabinet
Ministers have decided to accept salaries of £43,991 (Commons)
and £58,876 (Lords) rather than the full entitlement.
72
GOVERNMENT
There are standing committees dealing
with defence and overseas policy, economic
affairs, home and social affairs, the
environment and local government. Following
the election of the new Government in May
1997, two new committees have been set up:
on devolution to Scotland and Wales and the
English regions; and on constitutional reform
policy. Three committees active under the
previous administration have been disbanded:
those on nuclear defence policy;
competitiveness; and on the co-ordination and
presentation of government policies.
The membership and terms of reference of
all ministerial Cabinet committees are
published. Where appropriate, the Secretary
of the Cabinet and other senior officials of the
Cabinet Office attend meetings of the Cabinet
and its committees.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office is headed by the Secretary
of the Cabinet (a civil servant who is also Head
of the Home Civil Service) under the direction
of the Prime Minister. It comprises the
Cabinet Secretariat and the Office of Public
Service (OPS).
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers
collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business, and in the co-ordination of policy at
the highest level.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster
is in charge of the OPS and is a member of the
Cabinet. The OPS is responsible for:
• ensuring that Government provides
high-quality, efficient and customer-
friendly public services at the lowest
possible cost to the taxpayer (to be
achieved through a refocusing of the
Citizen’s Charter programme—see
P- 75);
• promoting the Government’s policies on
deregulation;
• promoting greater openness and
accountability in government; and
• improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of central government, through
the creation and review of executive
agencies (see p. 78).
The Historical and Records Section is
responsible for Official Histories and
managing Cabinet Office records.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that all ministers unanimously support
government policy once it has been settled.
The policy of departmental ministers must be
consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. Once the Government’s policy on
a matter has been decided, each minister is
expected to support it or resign. On rare
occasions, ministers have been allowed free
votes in Parliament on government policies
involving important issues of principle. In
April 1996, for example, free votes were
allowed on the length of time that must elapse
before a divorce application can be made, and
in June 1997 on prohibiting the private
ownership of handguns.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their Departments means that
they have a duty to Parliament to account, and
to be held to account for, the policies,
decisions and actions of their Departments.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
on important political matters they usually
consult their colleagues collectively, either
through the Cabinet or through a Cabinet
committee. A decision by a departmental
minister binds the Government as a whole.
On assuming office ministers must resign
directorships in private and public companies,
and must ensure that there is no conflict
between their public duties and private interests.
Government Departments
Government departments and their agencies,
staffed by politically impartial civil servants,
are the main instruments for implementing
government policy when Parliament has
passed the necessary legislation, and for
73
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
advising ministers. They often work alongside
local authorities, statutory boards, and
government-sponsored organisations
operating under various degrees of
government control.
A change of government does not
necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments,
although major changes in policy may be
accompanied by organisational changes.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
Britain as a whole. Other departments, such as
the Department of Social Security, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions are mainly concerned with
affairs in England.
The ten Government Offices for the
Regions are responsible for administering the
main regional programmes of the
Departments of Environment, Transport and
the Regions, Trade and Industry, and
Education and Employment, as well as
programmes from the Home Office; they also
administer the Single Regeneration Budget
(see p. 371).
Some departments which have direct
contact with the public throughout the
country also have local offices.
Departments are usually headed by
ministers. In some departments the head is a
permanent official, and ministers with other
duties are responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, ministers in the Treasury are
responsible for HM Customs and Excise, the
Inland Revenue, the Office for National
Statistics and a number of other departments,
as well as executive agencies such as the Royal
Mint. Departments generally receive their
funds directly out of money provided by
Parliament and are staffed by members of the
Civil Service.
The functions of the main government
departments and agencies are set out on pp.
530-7.
Non-departmental Public Bodies
Non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs)
have a role in the process of national
government but are neither government
departments nor parts of a department. There
are three main kinds: executive bodies,
advisory bodies and tribunals. Tribunals are a
specialised group of bodies whose functions
are essentially quasi-judicial (see p. 111).
The continuing need for each NDPB is
regularly reviewed in a continuous programme.
When they are no longer needed in their
existing form, the bodies are abolished, merged
or privatised. The overall number of NDPBs
decreased from 1,658 in 1986 to 1,194 in 1996,
a reduction of 28 per cent. During the same
period the number of staff in executive NDPBs
decreased from 146,300 to 107,000—a
reduction of 27 per cent.
The new Government proposes to
undertake a review of NDPBs with a view to
further reducing their numbers and making
the remainder more accountable.
Executive Bodies
Executive bodies normally employ their own
staff and are responsible for their own budget.
They are public organisations whose duties
include executive, administrative, regulatory
or commercial functions. They are normally
set up in statute, and operate within broad
policy guidelines set by departmental
Ministers but are in varying degrees
independent of government in carrying out
their day-to-day responsibilities. Examples
include the Commission for Racial Equality
and the Police Complaints Authority.
Ministerial appointments to executive
NDPBs are subject to the Commissioner for
Public Appointments’ Code of Practice (see p.
76). The Government is considering whether
the Commissioner’s remit should be extended
to cover other groups of public bodies.
Advisory Bodies
Many government departments are assisted by
advisory councils or committees which carry
out research and collect information, mainly to
give ministers access to informed opinion
before they come to a decision involving a
legislative or executive act. In some cases a
minister must consult a standing committee,
74
GOVERNMENT
but advisory bodies are usually set up
administratively at the discretion of the
minister. Examples include the British
Overseas Trade Board and the Farm Animal
Welfare Council.
The membership of advisory councils and
committees varies according to the nature of
the work involved, but often includes
representatives of the relevant interests and
professions.
For some particularly important issues,
Royal Commissions, whose members are
chosen for their wide experience, may be
appointed. Royal Commissions examine
evidence from government departments,
interested organisations and individuals, and
submit recommendations; some prepare
regular reports. One example is the standing
Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, set up in 1970. Inquiries may also
be undertaken by departmental committees
(which are not classified as advisory NDPBs).
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Press Secretary and other
staff in the Prime Minister’s Press Office have
direct contact with the parliamentary press
through regular meetings with the Lobby
correspondents. The Lobby correspondents
are a group of political correspondents with
the special privilege of access to the Lobby of
the House of Commons, where they can talk
privately to government ministers and other
members of the House. The Prime Minister’s
Press Office is the accepted channel through
which information about parliamentary
business is passed to the media.
Improving Public Services
The Citizen’s Charter
The Citizen’s Charter was launched in 1991 as
a ten-year programme to raise the standard of
public services and make them more
responsive to the needs and wishes of their
users. The new Government is to consult
widely with the general public on plans to
transform the existing programme of charters
to deliver what people want from public
services.
The Charter sets out a number of key
principles which users of public services are
entitled to expect. They include requirements
for published standards of services and results
achieved; comprehensive information on
services; consultation with users of services;
courteous and helpful service from public
servants; effective redress if things go wrong,
including well-publicised and easy-to-use
complaints procedures; and independent
inspectorates and auditing.
The Charter applies to all public services;
at both national and local level, and to the
privatised utilities. Most major public services
have now published separate charters. In
many cases separate charters have been
published for services in Northern Ireland,
Scotland and Wales. (Details of many of the
charters can be found in the relevant
chapters.)
Implementing the Charter
A Cabinet Minister, the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster, is responsible for the
Charter programme; he is supported by the
Citizen’s Charter Unit within the OPS (see
p. 73).
The Charter Mark Award Scheme rewards
excellence in delivering public services.
Applicants have to demonstrate that they have
achieved measurable improvements in the
quality of services over the previous two years,
and that their customers are satisfied with
their services.
In 1996 there were over 15,000 nominations
and 323 awards were made. Winners came
from all parts of the public sector throughout
Britain. They included: Greater Manchester
Police; the Science Museum (London); Mater
Hospital Trust Maternity Unit (Belfast);
Dumfries and Galloway Fire Brigade; and the
Welsh Institute of Sport (Cardiff).
Open Government
The Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information was introduced in
1994. It continues in force, in slightly
modified form. Under the Code, government
75
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
departments, agencies and executive public
bodies that are within the jurisdiction of the
Parliamentary Ombudsman should:
• give facts and analysis with major policy
decisions;
• make available internal guidelines about
dealings with the public;
• give reasons with administrative
decisions;
• provide information under the Citizen’s
Charter about public services; and
9 respond to requests providing the
information requested unless it is
considered exempt from disclosure under
specified exemptions.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman (see p. 70)
acts as an independent appeals mechanism for
those seeking information under the Code
who are dissatisfied with the response to their
enquiry and with the results of any internal
review of the original decision. Complaints to
the Parliamentary Ombudsman must be
referred through an MP.
A similar Code of Practice on Openness
covering all National Health Service (NHS)
organisations came into force in 1995. Also in
1995, the Local Authority Associations
published a guidance note on openness, which
was recommended to member authorities.
Freedom of Information
As part of its programme of constitutional
reform, the Government intends to introduce
a Freedom of Information Bill. A White Paper
setting out the Government’s proposals is due
towards the end of 1997 and a draft Bill will
follow in early 1998.
In the meantime, departments, agencies
and other public bodies covered by the Code
of Practice have been encouraged to be as open
as possible and to make full use of the
considerable discretion which the present
Code allows to enable a more positive
interpretation in individual cases.
Better Government
The new Government intends to publish a
White Paper early in 1998 on its programme
for ‘Better Government’. The Paper will
address four key challenges:
• cleaning up politics;
• rooting out waste and inefficiency in
public spending and getting results;
• listening to the people and developing
services to meet their needs; and
• breaking down institutional barriers and
working better together.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
This Committee was set up in 1994, under the
chairmanship of Lord Nolan, against a
background of increasing public concern
about standards in many areas of public life.
The Committee was asked to consider
standards of conduct and to make
recommendations designed to ensure that the
highest standards are maintained.
The Committee has produced three reports
(see Further Reading). Its First, in 1995, on
MPs, ministers and civil servants and national
non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs—
see p. 74), recommended, among other things,
independent elements in the scrutiny of the
conduct of MPs (see p. 64), in the acceptance
of appointments by ministers when they leave
office, and of how ministers make
appointments to public bodies. This led to the
issue of a code of conduct regulating the
behaviour of MPs and the appointment in
November 1995 of an independent
Commissioner for Public Appointments. The
Commissioner provides advice and guidance
to departments and monitors, regulates and
audits their procedures for making
appointments to executive NDPBs and NHS
bodies, ensuring that they are governed by the
overriding principle of appointment on merit.
He or she publishes an annual report
containing the results of the monitoring of all
departments’ appointments procedures.
Recommendations in Lord Nolan’s first
report also led to the revision in 1996 of the
rules on the acceptance of appointments
outside government by former civil servants.
This brought special advisers within the
system and enabled the Prime Minister’s
Advisory Committee on Business
76
GOVERNMENT
Appointments to announce the reasons for its
decisions and to advise a civil servant or
minister if the acceptance of a particular
appointment is inappropriate.
Building on recommendations in Nolan’s
first report, the new Government published a
consultation paper on the prevention of
corruption in June 1997.12 This proposes
creating a new single criminal offence of
corruption covering both the public and
private sectors, where those found guilty
could face up to seven years’ imprisonment.
Lord Nolan’s latest report, on aspects of
conduct in local government, was published in
July 1997. It calls for a radical change in the
ethical framework within which local
government operates. Its recommendations
include, among other things, a new statutory
criminal offence of misuse of public office.
The Government plans to implement the
Nolan recommendations fully and to extend
them to all public bodies.
The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the
conduct of the whole range of government
activities as they affect the community. These
range from policy formulation to carrying out
the day-to-day duties of public administration.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown.
For all practical purposes the Crown in this
context means, and is represented by, the
Government of the day. In most
circumstances the executive powers of the
Crown are exercised by, and on the advice of,
Her Majesty’s ministers, who are in turn
answerable to Parliament. The Civil Service as
such has no constitutional personality or
responsibility separate from that of the
Government of the day. The duty of the
individual civil servant is first and foremost to
the minister of the Crown who is in charge of
the Department in which he or she is serving.
A change of minister, for whatever reason,
does not involve a change of staff. Ministers
sometimes appoint special advisers from
outside the Civil Service. (There are about 44
such advisers in the present administration.)
12 Prevention of Corruption: Consolidation and Amendment of the
Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889-1916: A Government Statement.
The advisers are normally paid from public
funds, but their appointments come to an end
when the Government’s term of office finishes,
or when the minister concerned leaves the
Government or moves to another appointment.
A new Civil Service code came into force in
January 1996. This provides a statement of the
constitutional framework within which all civil
servants work and the values they are expected
to uphold. The Code includes an independent
line of appeal to the Civil Service
Commissioners on alleged breaches of the
Code. The Government intends to give legal
force to the Code.
The number of civil servants fell from a
peak of 751,000 in 1976 to 476,000 in April
1997, a decrease of 37 per cent and its lowest
since 1945. This reflects the Government’s
policy of controlling the cost of the Civil
Service and of improving its efficiency.
About half of all civil servants are engaged
in the provision of public services. These
include paying sickness benefits and pensions,
collecting taxes and contributions, running
employment services, staffing prisons, and
providing services to industry and agriculture.
A further quarter are employed in the
Ministry of Defence. The rest are divided
between central administrative and policy
duties; support services; and largely financially
self-supporting services, for instance, those
provided by National Savings and the Royal
Mint. Four-fifths of civil servants work
outside London.
The total also includes members of the
Senior Civil Service—around 3,000 of the
most senior managers and policy advisers.
They are responsible for serving the collective
interest of government with a focus and
loyalty wider than their own departments and
agencies.
Equality of Opportunity
The Government is committed to achieving
equality of opportunity for all its staff. In
support of this commitment, the Civil Service,
which recruits and promotes on the basis of
merit, is actively pursuing policies to develop
career opportunities for women, ethnic
minorities and people with disabilities. In
April 1996:
77
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
• women represented 51 per cent of all
non-industrial civil servants—47 per cent
of all staff at Executive Officer level (the
first management grade) were women
and around 17 per cent of women worked
in the Senior Civil Service. Nearly 21 per
cent of all female non-industrial staff
were working part-time.
• 5.5 per cent of non-industrial civil
servants were of ethnic minority origin,
compared with 4.9 per cent in the
economically active population in spring
1996;and
• 2.9 per cent of disabled people were
employed in the non-industrial home
Civil Service.
Progress is monitored and reported on
regularly by the Cabinet Office (OPS).
Central Management
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service is divided
between the Cabinet Office (OPS) and the
Treasury. The OPS, which is under the
control of the Prime Minister, as Minister for
the Civil Service, oversees organisation, senior
civil service pay, pensions and allowances,
recruitment, retirement and redundancy
policy, personnel management and statistics,
and the overall efficiency of the Service.
The function of official Head of the Home
Civil Service is combined with that of
Secretary of the Cabinet.
Executive Agencies: Next Steps
Programme
The Next Steps Programme, launched in
1988, aims to deliver government services
more efficiently and effectively within
available resources for the benefit of taxpayers,
customers and staff. This has involved setting
up, as far as is practicable, separate units or
agencies to perform the executive functions of
government. Agencies remain part of the Civil
Service, but under the terms of individual
framework documents they enjoy greater
delegation of financial, pay and personnel
matters. Agencies are headed by chief
executives who are normally directly
accountable to ministers but who are
personally responsible for day-to-day
operations. The pay of agency chief executives
is normally directly related to their agency’s
performance.
No body carrying out a government
function can become an agency until the ‘prior
options’ of abolition, privatisation and
contracting out have been considered and
ruled out. These ‘prior options’ are
reconsidered when agencies are reviewed,
normally after five years of operation.
By July 1997, 138 agencies were in existence,
together with 24 Executive Units of Customs
and Excise and 24 Executive Offices of the
Inland Revenue. At that time over 387,000 civil
servants—76 per cent of the total —worked in
organisations run on Next Steps lines. At the
same time a further 16 agency candidates—
employing nearly 7,300 staff—had been
identified as suitable for agency status.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 5,800 people, provides the staff for the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office (see p. 115)
and for British diplomatic missions abroad.
The Diplomatic Service has its own grade
structure, linked to that of the Home Civil
Service. Terms and conditions of service are
comparable, but take into account the special
demands of the Service, particularly the
requirement to serve abroad. Home civil
servants, members of the armed forces and
individuals from the private sector may also
serve in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office
and at overseas posts on loan or attachment.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants are required to perform loyally
the duties assigned to them by the
Government of the day, whatever its political
persuasion. It is essential that ministers and
the public should have confidence that the
personal views of civil servants do not
influence the performance of their official
duties, given the role of the Civil Service in
serving successive governments formed by
different parties.
78
GOVERNMENT
The aim of the rules which govern political
activities by civil servants is to allow them,
subject to these fundamental principles, the
greatest possible freedom to participate in
public affairs consistent with their rights and
duties as citizens. The rules are therefore
concerned with activities liable to give public
expression to political views rather than with
privately held beliefs and opinions. The Civil
Service is divided into three groups for the
purposes of deciding the extent to which
individuals may take part in political activities:
• those in the ‘politically free’ group,
consisting of industrial staff and non-
office grades, are free to engage in any
political activity outside official time,
including adoption as a prospective
candidate for the British or the European
Parliament (although they would have to
resign from the Service before giving
their consent to nomination);
• those in the ‘politically restricted’ group,
which comprises staff in Grade 7 and
above as well as Administration Trainees
and Higher Executive Officers (D), may
not take part in national political
activities but may apply for permission to
take part in local political activities; and
• the ‘intermediate’ group, which
comprises all other civil servants, may
apply for permission to take part in
national or local political activity, apart
from candidature for the British or the
European Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to
the maximum extent consistent with the Civil
Service’s reputation for political impartiality
and the avoidance of any conflict with official
duties. A code of discretion requires
moderation and the avoidance of
embarrassment to ministers.
Generally, there are no restrictions on the
private activities of civil servants, provided
that these do not bring discredit on the Civil
Service, and that there is no possibility of
conflict with official duties. For instance, a
civil servant must comply with any
departmental instruction on the need to seek
authority before taking part in any outside
activity which involves official experience.
Security
Each department is responsible for its own
internal security. As a general rule the
privately held political views of civil servants
are not a matter of official concern. However,
no one who is, or has been involved in, or
associated with, activities threatening national
security may be employed on work which is
vital to the security of the State. Certain posts
are not open to people who fall into this
category, or to anyone whose reliability may
be in doubt for any other reason.
The Security Commission may investigate
breaches of security in the public service and
advise on changes in security procedure if
asked to do so by the Prime Minister after
consultation with the Leader of the
Opposition.
Local Government
Although the origins of local government in
England can be traced back to Saxon times,
the first comprehensive system of local
councils was established in the late 19th
century. Major reforms to the structure of
local government are now being implemented.
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities derive their power from
legislation. They can act only under powers
conferred on them by Acts of Parliament. If
these powers are exceeded, the local authority
concerned can be challenged in a court of law.
Local authorities’ functions are far-reaching.
Some are mandatory, which means that the
authority must do what is required by law;
others are purely permissive, allowing an
authority to provide services if it wishes. In
certain services, ministers have powers to
secure a degree of uniformity in standards in
order to safeguard public health or to protect
the rights of individual citizens.
The main link between local authorities and
central government in England is the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions. However, other departments
such as the Department for Education and
Employment and the Home Office are also
concerned with various local government
79
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
functions. In the rest of Britain the local
authorities deal with the Scottish or Welsh
Offices or the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland, as appropriate.
In June 1997 the Government signed the
Council of Europe’s Charter of Local Self
Government. This lays down standards for
protecting and developing the rights of local
authorities.
Local Government Reform
A major reform of local government took place
in 1974 in England and Wales and in 1975 in
Scotland. This created two main tiers of local
authority throughout England and Wales:
counties and the smaller districts. Local
government in London had been reorganised
along the same lines in 1965. In Scotland
functions were allocated to regions and
districts on the mainland; single-tier
authorities were introduced for the three
Islands areas. In Northern Ireland changes
were made in 1973 which replaced the two-
tier county council and urban/rural council
system with a single-tier district council
system.
The Local Government Act 1985 abolished
the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils in England.
Most of their functions were transferred to the
London boroughs and metropolitan district
councils respectively in 1986 (see below).
Recent Changes
During the last five years a further restructuring
of local government has taken place in non¬
metropolitan England and in Scotland and
Wales. In 1992 the Local Government
Commission was established to review the
structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England
and to undertake periodic electoral reviews. So
far most of its work has been to review the
structure of local government in non¬
metropolitan England. The reviews considered
whether the two-tier structure should be
replaced by single-tier (‘unitary’) authorities in
each area; for the most part the Commission
recommended the retention of two-tier
government, but suggested unitary authorities
for some areas, especially the larger cities.
Parliament approved reorganisation in 25
counties, creating a total of 46 unitary councils
(see map on p. 7). By April 1997,27 of these
had been established; the last 19 will be in place
by April 1998.
In Scotland 29 new unitary councils
replaced the previous system of nine regional
and 53 district councils in April 1996; the
three Islands councils have remained in being.
In Wales, 22 unitary authorities replaced the
previous eight county councils and 37 district
councils, again in April 1996.
Principal Types of Local Authority
Greater London
Greater London is divided into 32 boroughs
and the Corporation of the City of London,
each with a council responsible for all local
government services in its area. Exceptions
include London’s metropolitan police force,
which is responsible to the Home Secretary,
and public transport, responsibility for which
lies with London Transport (see p. 309).
Proposals for London Government
At present London is the only Western capital
without an elected city-wide government. In
July 1997 the Government issued a Green
Paper13 on proposals for establishing a directly
elected strategic authority and directly elected
mayor in London. The strategic authority,
which would encompass the 32 London
boroughs and the City of London
Corporation, would not duplicate the work of
the London boroughs, but would take
responsibility for London-wide issues such as
economic regeneration, planning, policing,
transport and environmental protection. The
Government plans to introduce legislation to
enable a referendum to be held in London to
confirm popular demand. A White Paper
describing the proposed new authority would
be issued before the referendum. Subject to
parliamentary approval, the referendum
‘3 New Leadership for London: the Government's Proposals for a
Greater London Authority. Cm 3724.
80
GOVERNMENT
would be held in May 1998, and in the event
of a majority in favour of those voting, and
parliamentary approval of the necessary
legislation, the new mayor and authority
would be elected in May 2000.
English Metropolitan Counties
The six metropolitan counties—Tyne and
Wear, West Midlands, Merseyside, Greater
Manchester, West Yorkshire and South
Yorkshire—have 36 district councils, but no
county councils. The district councils are
responsible for all services apart from those
which require a statutory authority over areas
wider than the individual boroughs and
districts. They are: waste disposal (in certain
areas); the fire services, including civil
defence; and public transport. These are run
by joint authorities composed of elected
councillors nominated by the borough or
district councils. Local councils also provide
many of the members of the police authorities
(see p. 92).
English Non-Metropolitan Counties
Outside Greater London and the
metropolitan areas, England was, before the
recent reforms, divided into counties, sub¬
divided into districts. All the districts and the
non-metropolitan counties and districts had
locally elected councils with separate
functions. County councils provided large-
scale services such as education and social
services, while district councils were
responsible for the more local ones (see
below). These arrangements are broadly
continuing in areas where two-tier local
government will remain. In areas where the
new unitary authorities are being created, both
county and district level functions are being
brought together.
County councils are responsible for
strategic planning, transport planning,
highways, traffic regulation, education,14
consumer protection, refuse disposal, the fire
u Under the Education Reform Act 1988, schools have been able
to ‘opt out’ of local education authority control by obtaining grant-
maintained status. However legislation is now before Parliament to
end the grant maintained schools programme (see p. 437).
service, libraries and the personal social
services. District councils are responsible for
environmental health, housing, decisions on
most local planning applications, and refuse
collection. Both tiers of local authority have
powers to provide facilities such as museums,
art galleries and parks; arrangements depend
on local agreement. Where unitary authorities
are created in non-metropolitan areas, they are
generally responsible for both county and
district level functions.
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, over 8,000 parish councils
or meetings provide and manage local facilities
such as allotments and village halls, and act as
agents for other district council functions.
They also provide a forum for discussion of
local issues.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
In Scotland the 32 single-tier councils are
responsible for the full range of local
government services. In Wales the 22 single¬
tier councils have similar functions, except
that fire services are provided by three
combined fire authorities. In addition, about
730 community councils in Wales have
functions similar to those of the parish
councils in England (see above); in Scotland
community councils exist to represent the
views of their local communities to local
authorities and other public bodies in the area.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils are
responsible for local environmental and certain
other services, such as leisure and the arts.
Responsibility for planning, roads, water supply
and sewerage services is exercised in each district
through a divisional office of the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland. Area
boards, responsible to central departments,
administer education, public libraries and the
health and personal social services locally.
Statutory bodies, such as the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive and area boards, are
responsible to central government departments
for administering other major services.
Election of Councils
Local councils consist of elected councillors.
In England and Wales each council elects its
81
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
presiding officer annually. Some districts have
the ceremonial title of borough, or city, both
granted by royal authority. In boroughs and
cities the presiding officer is normally known
as the Mayor. In the City of London and
certain other large cities, he or she is known as
the Lord Mayor. In Scotland the presiding
officer of the district council of each of the
four cities—Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh
and Glasgow—is called the Lord Provost.
Most councillors are elected for four years.
All county councils in England, borough
councils in London, and about two-thirds of
non-metropolitan district councils are elected
in their entirety every four years. In the
remaining districts (including all metropolitan
districts) one-third of the councillors are
elected in each of the three years when county
council elections are not held. In Scotland
local elections will now be held every three
years, with the next elections due in 1999.
Each election covers the whole council. In
Wales elections for the full councils will
continue to be held every fourth year, again
with the next due in 1999.
Councillors are paid a basic allowance but
may also be entitled to additional allowances
and expenses for attending meetings or taking
on special responsibilities. Parish and
community councillors cannot claim allowances
for duties undertaken within their own council
areas. In Scotland community councillors are
not eligible for any form of allowance.
Voters
Anyone may vote at a local government
election in Britain provided he or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• a citizen of Britain or of another
Commonwealth country, or of the Irish
Republic, or a citizen of the European
Union;
• not subject to any legal incapacity to vote;
and
• on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must be
resident in the council area on the qualifying
date. In Northern Ireland there are slightly
different requirements.
Candidates
Most candidates at local government elections
stand as representatives of a national political
party, although some stand as independents.
Candidates must be British citizens, other
Commonwealth citizens or citizens of the
European Union, and aged 21 or over. In
addition, they must also either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the relevant local authority; or
• have occupied (as owner or tenant) land
or premises in that area during the whole
of the preceding 12 months; or
• have had their main place of work in the
area throughout this 12-month period;
or
• have resided in the area throughout this
12-month period.
No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee, and there are
some other disqualifications. All candidates
for district council elections in Northern
Ireland are required to make a declaration
against terrorism.
Electoral Divisions and Procedure
Counties in England are divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Districts in England and Northern Ireland
are divided into wards, returning one i
councillor or more. In Scotland the new
unitary councils are divided into wards and in
Wales into electoral divisions; each returns
one or more councillors. Parishes (in
England) and communities (in Wales) may be
divided into wards. Wards return at least one
councillor.
The procedure for local government voting
in Great Britain is broadly similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
local government elections are held by
proportional representation, and electoral
wards are grouped into district electoral areas.
The boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local authorities in England
are kept under review by the Local
Government Commission (see p. 80), and in
Wales and Scotland by the Local Government
Boundary Commissions.
82
GOVERNMENT
Provision of Local Services
In recent years, there has been a move away
from direct service provision, to a greater use
of private contractors, and an increase in what
is often called the ‘enabling’ role. Local
authorities now carry out many functions in
partnership with other organisations, public
and private. For example, councils often have
nomination rights to housing association
properties (see p. 385), so that they are acting
not as provider but as ‘gatekeeper’. Likewise,
under the community care reforms, councils
with social services responsibilities draw up
care plans for those who need them (see p.
414), but the care is often provided by the
private or voluntary sectors funded by the
council rather than directly by the local
authority itself.
The previous administration introduced
legislation in the 1980s aimed at encouraging
local authorities to obtain better value for
money in the services they provide. It
introduced a practice known as compulsory
competitive tendering (CCT), under which
many services traditionally provided by the
council’s own staff, such as refuse collection
and leisure management, must now be put out
to tender and won in open competition.
In a departure from the approach of its
predecessor, the Government elected in May
1997 intends to develop a new system to
achieve best value in the delivery of local
government services. It considers that councils
should not be forced to put their services out
to tender, but equally it sees no reason why a
service should be delivered directly if more
efficient means are available elsewhere. It
intends to replace CCT with a new duty for
local councils to ensure best value for the
public and will introduce legislation as soon as
the parliamentary timetable allows.
Before replacing CCT, pilot schemes are to
be run in some local authority areas to see how
a best-value regime would work. Criteria for
the pilot schemes will include a requirement
for an authority to publish its plans for
improving the quality of services, increasing
efficiency, and reducing costs to the taxpayer.
The criteria will also reflect the Government’s
view that competition will continue to be an
important management tool and test of best
value, but that it will not be the only
management tool and is not in itself enough to
demonstrate that best value is being achieved.
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom to
make arrangements for carrying out their duties.
Some decisions are made by the full council;
many other matters are delegated to committees
composed of members of the council. A council
may delegate most functions to a committee or
officer, although certain powers are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales are
often able to do their work in full session,
although they appoint committees from time to
time as necessary.
In England and Wales committees
generally have to reflect the political
composition of the council (although the
legislation governing this specifically excludes
parish or community councils). In practice,
this is often also the case in Scotland, although
it is not enforced by legislation. People who
are not members of the council may be co¬
opted onto decision-making committees and
can speak and take part in debates; they cannot
normally vote. Legislation also prevents senior
officers and others in politically sensitive posts
from being members of another local authority
or undertaking public political activity.
Some of these provisions have not been
introduced in Northern Ireland.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are admitted to
council, committee and sub-committee
meetings, and have access to agendas, reports
and minutes of meetings and certain
background papers. Local authorities may
exclude the public from meetings and withhold
these papers only in limited circumstances.
Employees
About 1.4 million people15 are employed by
local authorities in England (the figure for
15 Whole time equivalents.
83
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
Scotland is 240,000). These include
administrative, professional and technical
staff, teachers, fire-fighters, and manual
workers, but exclude those in law and order
services. Education is the largest service.
Councils are individually responsible, within
certain national legislative requirements, for
deciding the structure of their workforces.
Senior staff appointments are usually made
by the elected councillors. More junior
appointments are made by heads of
departments. Pay and conditions of service are
usually a matter for each council, although
there are scales recommended by national
negotiating machinery between authorities
and trade unions, and most authorities follow
these.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 25 per cent of public spending. In
1996-97 expenditure by local authorities in
Britain was about £75,560 million. Current
expenditure amounted to £65,514 million;
capital expenditure, net of capital receipts, was
£5,920 million; and debt interest £4,115
million. Local government capital expenditure
is financed primarily by borrowing within
limits set by central government and from
capital receipts from the disposal of land and
buildings. Local authorities in Great Britain
raise revenue through the council tax (see
chapter 11), which meets about 20 per cent of
their revenue expenditure. Their revenue
spending is, however, financed primarily by
grants from central government and by the
redistribution of revenue from the national
non-domestic rate, a property tax levied on
businesses and other non-domestic properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland
continue to raise revenue through the levying
of a domestic rate and business rates.
Financial Safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be
audited by independent auditors appointed by
the Audit Commission in England and Wales,
or in Scotland by the Accounts Commission
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland this role is
exercised by the chief local government
auditor, who is appointed by the Department
of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Local Government Complaints System
Local authorities are encouraged to resolve
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public will often ask their own
councillor for assistance in this. Local
authorities must also appoint a monitoring
officer, whose duties include ensuring that the
local authority acts lawfully in the conduct of
its business.
Allegations of local government
maladministration leading to injustice may be
investigated by statutory independent
Commissioners for Local Administration,
often known as ‘local government
ombudsmen’. There are three of these in
England, and one each in Wales and Scotland.
A report is issued on each complaint fully
investigated and, if injustice caused by
maladministration is found, the local
ombudsman normally proposes a remedy. The
council must consider the report and reply to
it. In 1996-97 the local government
ombudsman for England received 15,322
complaints, less than one per cent fewer than
in 1995-96. Of these, 273 led to the issue of a
formal report.
An independent review of the local
government ombudsman service in England
was completed in 1996. This identified ways
of providing a better service to the public, and
the Commission is taking action to implement
improvements.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.
Pressure Groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations
which aim to influence Parliament and
Government in the way decisions are made
and carried out, to the benefit of their
members and the causes they support. There
is a huge range of groups, covering politics,
84
GOVERNMENT
business, employment, consumer affairs,
ethnic minorities, aid to developing countries,
foreign relations, education, culture, defence,
religion, sport, transport, social welfare,
animal welfare and the environment. Some
have over a million members, others only a
few dozen. Some exert pressure on a number
of different issues; others are concerned with a
single issue. Some have come to play a
recognised role in the way Britain is governed;
others seek influence through radical protest.
While political parties seek to win political
power, pressure groups aim to influence those
who are in power, rather than to exercise the
responsibility of government and to legislate.
Pressure Groups and Policy
Pressure groups operating at a national level
have a number of methods for influencing the
way Britain is governed. Action by them may
highlight a particular problem, which is then
acknowledged by the Government. Groups
whose scale of membership indicates that they
are broadly representative in their field may
then be consulted by a government
department, or take part in Whitehall working
groups or advisory councils. If the Government
considers that legislation is necessary, then
proposals are drafted, which are circulated to
interested groups for their comments.
Legislation is then put before Parliament, and
at various times during the passage of a Bill—
especially at the committee stage—pressure
groups have opportunities to influence its
content. If the Act includes delegated
legislation (see p. 67), pressure groups may be
consulted and have the opportunity to provide
information and express their views.
Pressure Groups and Government
The principle of consultation to gain the
consent and co-operation of as wide a range of
organisations as possible, and ensure the smooth
working of laws and regulations, plays an
important part in the relationship between
government departments and interested groups.
In some instances a department is under
legal obligation to consult interested groups.
The Government has a duty to consult
organised interests, providing the pressure
groups involved have a broad enough
membership for them to represent a majority
view, and provided that they observe
confidentiality about their discussions with the
department. Members of pressure groups
often have direct expertise, and an awareness
of what is practicable, and can give advice and
information to civil servants engaged in
preparing policy or legislation. In return, the
pressure groups have the opportunity to
express their opinions directly to the
Government. The contacts between civil
servants and pressure group representatives
may be relatively informal—by letter or
telephone—or more formal, through
involvement in working parties or by giving
evidence to committees of inquiry.
Administration by Pressure Groups
The Government also makes grants to
pressure groups which, as well as speaking on
behalf of their members or for an issue,
provide a service. For example, Relate:
National Marriage Guidance has received
grants for the advice centres it runs, and
government departments make grants to a
number of pressure groups for research
relating to public policy.
Pressure Groups and Parliament
Lobbying—the practice of approaching MPs
or Lords, persuading them to act on behalf of
a cause, and enabling them to do so by
providing advice and information—is a form
of pressure group activity which has
substantially increased in recent years.
A common pressure group tactic is to ask
members of the public to write to their MP
about an issue—for example, the Sunday
trading laws, or the plight of political
prisoners in particular countries—in order to
raise awareness and persuade the MP to
support the cause.
Raising Issues in Parliament
Other ways through which pressure groups
may exert influence include:
• suggesting to MPs or Lords subjects for
Private Members’ Bills (see p. 66); many
85
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
pressure groups have ready-drafted
legislation waiting to be sponsored;
• approaching MPs or Lords to ask
parliamentary questions as a means of
gaining information from the
Government and of drawing public
attention to an issue;
• suggesting to MPs subjects for Early Day
Motions (see p. 69) and suggesting to
Lords subjects for debates; and
• orchestrating public petitions as a form of
protest against government policy, or to
call for action. If the petition is to be
presented in Parliament, it must be
worded according to Commons or Lords
rules, and be presented by an MP or
Lord in his or her own House.
Parliamentary Lobbyists
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers,
whose job is to develop contacts with MPs and
Lords sympathetic to their cause, and to brief
them when issues affecting the group are
raised in Parliament.
There are also public relations and political
consultancy firms specialising in lobbying
Parliament and Government. Such firms are
employed by pressure groups—as well as by
British and overseas companies and
organisations—to monitor parliamentary
business, and to promote their clients’
interests where they are affected by legislation
and debate.

The Government elected in May 1997 has been carrying out an investigation
into the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system in England
and Wales. It plans to introduce legislation to improve the youth justice system
and to combat anti-social behaviour and petty criminality in local
communities. Plans for fundamental reform of the civil justice and legal aid
systems in England and Wales were unveiled in October 1997.
Although Britain is a unitary state, it does
not have a single legal system. England and
Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland have
their own systems, with differences in law,
organisation and practice (although
Northern Ireland’s legal system is in many
ways similar to that in England and Wales).
This situation arises from the different
arrangements that existed in the constituent
parts of the country when they were united.
Mam Branches of Law
The two main branches of the law in Britain are
criminal law and civil law: criminal law deals with
wrongs affecting the community for which the
State may prosecute in the criminal courts, while
civil law is about deciding disputes between two
parties—individuals or administrative authorities
or commercial organisations.
Sources of Law
One of the main sources of law in England and
Wales and in Northern Ireland is common
law, which has evolved over centuries from
judges’ decisions. It forms the basis of the law
except when superseded by legislation. The
doctrine of legal precedent has also been more
strictly applied in Scotland since the end of
the 18th century.
Much of the law, particularly that relating to
criminal justice, is statute law passed by
Parliament. If a court reaches a decision which
is contrary to the intentions of Parliament, then
Parliament must either accept the decision or
pass amending legislation. Some Acts create
new law, while others draw together existing
law on a given topic. Parliament can repeal a
statute and replace it with another.
European Community Law
European Community law, which applies to
Britain by virtue of its membership of the
European Union (see p. 116), derives from the
European Community treaties and the
legislation adopted under them. EC legislation
has been adopted in most of the fields covered
by the Community treaties, including
87
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
economic and social matters, agriculture and
the environment. Where EC law is applicable,
it takes precedence over domestic law. It is
normally applied by the domestic courts, but
the most authoritative rulings are given by the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
(see p. 118).
The new Government proposes to
incorporate the main provisions of the 1950
European Convention on Human Rights into
domestic law, but without reducing the
sovereignty of the British Parliament (see
p. 52).
Administration of the Law
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
England and Wales
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary and a senior Cabinet Minister. His
administrative responsibility for the Supreme
Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, High
Court and Crown Court) and the county
courts in England and Wales is exercised
through the Court Service. He is also
responsible for the locally administered
magistrates’ courts. He advises the Crown on
the appointment of most members of the
higher judiciary, and he appoints most
magistrates. In addition, he is responsible for
promoting general reforms of the civil law and
for the legal aid schemes.
The Home Secretary 's overall
responsibility for criminal law, the police
service, the prison system, the probation and
after-care service, and advising the Crown on
the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal legal
advisers and represent the Crown in
appropriate domestic and international cases.
The former is also Attorney General for
Northern Ireland. As well as exercising
various civil law functions, the Attorney
General has final responsibility for enforcing
the criminal law. The Solicitor General is the
Attorney’s deputy.
As head of the Crown Prosecution Service
(see p. 96), the Director of Public Prosecutions is
subject to superintendence by the Attorney
General, as are the Director of the Serious
Fraud Office and Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
Scotland
The Secretary of State for Scotland is
responsible for Scottish criminal law, crime
prevention, the police, the penal system and
legal aid. He or she is also responsible for
substantive civil law. The Secretary of State
recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the
staff of the High Court of Justiciary and the
Court of Session, and is responsible for the
administration and staffing of the sheriff
courts.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland, both government
ministers, are the chief legal advisers to the
Government on Scottish questions and the
principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of prosecutions and other litigation
in Scotland. The Lord Advocate has
ministerial responsibility for the law of
evidence (civil and criminal) and for
jurisdiction and procedures of the civil courts
in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
Court administration is the responsibility of
the Lord Chancellor, while the Northern
Ireland Office, under the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, deals with policy and
legislation concerning criminal law, the police
and the penal system. The Lord Chancellor
has general responsibility for legal aid, advice
and assistance.
PERSONNEL OF THE LAW
The law is enforced by judicial officers,
ranging from judges in the House of Lords
and the superior courts to the stipendiary and
lay justices who, together with juries in certain
cases, are responsible for deciding disputed
cases. It also depends on officers of the court
who have general or specialised functions of an
administrative, and sometimes of a judicial,
nature in the courts to which they are
88
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
attached. Barristers—or advocates in
Scotland—and solicitors represent the
interests of parties to a dispute.
Judges are not subject to ministerial
direction or control. They are normally
appointed from practising barristers and
advocates or solicitors.
Lay magistrates in England and Wales, and
Scottish district court justices, are trained in
order to give them sufficient knowledge of the
law, including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing. In
Northern Ireland members of a lay panel who
serve in juvenile courts undertake training
courses; resident magistrates are drawn from
practising solicitors or barristers.
The legal profession is divided into two
branches: barristers—or advocates in
Scotland—and solicitors. Barristers and
advocates advise on legal problems submitted
through solicitors or other recognised
professional bodies and present cases in all
courts. Solicitors undertake legal business for
individual and corporate clients; they can also,
after appropriate training and accreditation,
present cases in all courts. Although people
are free to conduct their own cases, most
people prefer to be legally represented,
especially in more serious cases.
The Legal Services Ombudsman for
England and Wales conducts investigations
into the way professional bodies handle
complaints against barristers, solicitors and
licensed conveyancers. There is a separate
Ombudsman for Scotland.
Criminal Justice
Crime Statistics
There are two main measures of the likely
scale of crime in Britain—the recording of
offences by the police, and periodic surveys
among representative samples of crime
victims. Recorded crime in England and
Wales in 1996 is given in Table 8.1. In
1996-97 the Scottish police recorded 440,687
crimes; of these, 37 per cent were cleared up.
In Northern Ireland, of the 68,549 recorded
crimes in 1996, 23,103 were cleared up.
While increasing crime has been shown to
be an international phenomenon, some
categories of recorded crime in England and
Wales, and in Scotland, have shown
reductions in recent years.
Crime in Britain tends to be concentrated
in cities and urban areas. About 92 per cent of
offences recorded by the police in 1996 in
England and Wales were directed against
property; only 7 per cent involved violence.
Car crime accounted for about 26 per cent of
recorded crimes (and has been the focus for
much government crime prevention activity).
The demand for, and supply of, illegal drugs
has also been a rising factor in the incidence
of crime.
While regular crime surveys indicate that
many crimes go unrecorded by the police (as
not all victims report what has happened to
them), they do confirm that the great majority
of crimes are against property.

GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
Crime Prevention Measures
Crime prevention is an important strand of
government criminal justice policy. The Crime
Prevention Agency was established within the
Home Office in 1996 to initiate, develop and co¬
ordinate effective crime prevention and
reduction initiatives in England and Wales. Its
work is overseen by the Crime Prevention
Agency Board, bringing together the key bodies
involved in promoting crime prevention—the
Home Office, the Association of Chief Police
Officers, Crime Concern (an independent
organisation which encourages local initiatives
and business participation in crime prevention),
local government authorities, police authorities
(see p. 92) and business.
The agency supports the police crime
prevention effort through its Crime
Prevention College near York, which is the
national centre for training police officers in
prevention skills. About 800 specialist crime
prevention officers are employed in police
forces across England and Wales.
There is a Crime Prevention Council in
Scotland and a Crime Prevention Panel in
Northern Ireland.
Initiatives
The public help the police to deter crime
through, particularly, Neighbourhood Watch
and Street Watch schemes, in which local
people keep a look-out for any suspicious
activity in their area and inform the police
accordingly. There are many thousands of
such schemes across Britain.
The widespread introduction of closed-
circuit television (CCTV) surveillance systems
is proving very effective in preventing and
detecting crime, and in deterring criminals, in
high streets, shopping centres, schools,
industrial estates and other areas.
Since 1988 the Safer Cities programme has,
with substantial government funding,
promoted joint crime prevention action by
local government, businesses, the police and
voluntary agencies in England and Wales.
There is a parallel Safer Cities programme in
Scotland, and similarly funded projects in
Northern Ireland.
The Government intends to introduce
legislation to place a new responsibility on
police services and local authorities to develop
statutory partnerships to help prevent crime
and enhance community safety. Local
authorities will then be required to set targets
for the reduction of crime and disorder in
their area.
Helping Victims and Witnesses
Throughout England and Wales there are
some 365 victim support schemes, with over
12,000 volunteer visitors, providing practical
help and emotional support to victims of
crime. The schemes are co-ordinated by a
national organisation, Victim Support, which
receives government funding. Victim Support
runs the Witness Service, which helps victims
and other witnesses attending Crown Court
centres. Similar victim support schemes
operate in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
A Victim’s Charter, published in 1996, sets
out the standards of service that victims
should expect from criminal justice agencies in
England and Wales.
In June 1997 the new Government
announced a review of the way in which
victims and vulnerable witnesses are treated
by the criminal justice system. The review will
be wide-ranging, from the initial investigation
through to the trial and beyond, with the aim
of identifying measures to protect those likely
to be subject to intimidation and to assist
vulnerable witnesses give best evidence in
court.
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland, including
foreign nationals, may be eligible for
compensation from public funds under the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. In
Northern Ireland there are separate statutory
arrangements for compensation for criminal
injuries, and for malicious damage to
property, including any resulting loss of
profits.
Tackling Drug Misuse
The Government’s strategy for tackling drug
misuse involves:
• international co-operation against
production and trafficking;
90
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
• law enforcement by police and customs,
and maintenance of tight domestic
controls and effective deterrents; and
• preventive education, publicity, and
community action, and the treatment and
rehabilitation of offenders.
The new Government has appointed an
Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator (or ‘Drug Czar’)
to co-ordinate the fight against drugs in
Britain. The Drug Czar will report to the
newly appointed Cabinet sub-committee
on Drug Misuse, and will review the
overall direction of government action,
support and help co-ordinate the effort of
relevant agencies, put forward proposals
for a new strategy for England and ensure
strategic coherence to the government
efforts across Britain and internationally.
In England the drugs strategy for the
period 1995—98 seeks to involve the voluntary
and private sectors, local authorities, schools,
parents, health professionals and criminal
justice agencies in a comprehensive
programme to reduce supply, demand and
misuse of illegal drugs. It aims to take action
by vigorous law enforcement, accessible
treatment and a new emphasis on education
and prevention to:
• increase the safety of communities from
drug-related crime;
• reduce the acceptability and availability
of drugs to young people; and
• reduce the health risks and other damage
related to drug misuse.
Across England 105 Drug Action Teams
have been set up to implement the strategy at
local level. The teams consist of senior
representatives from the key statutory
agencies—the police, probation and prison
services, customs, and health and local
authorities—working with the voluntary
sector, local media, parents and young people.
Each Drug Action Team receives, on average,
annual £33,000 development funding from
central government.
Separate strategies are in place for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In 1996-97 the European Drug Liaison
Officer network of the National Criminal
Intelligence Service (NCIS—see p. 93)
contributed to the seizure in Britain of drugs
with a street value of more than £182 million,
and the recovery of property worth over £12
million.
Measures to Combat Terrorism
Most of the powers which the police use to
combat terrorism and the offences with which
terrorists might be charged are contained in the
general criminal law. However, the Prevention
of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act
1989, and legislation relating specifically to
Northern Ireland (see below), confer some
exceptional powers, and create additional
offences, in order to combat terrorism.
The special counter-terrorist legislation
gives the Secretary of State the power to:
• proscribe any organisation which appears
to be concerned with terrorism in
Northern Ireland; and
• exclude from all or part of Britain people
who are believed to be, or to have been,
involved in terrorism connected with the
affairs of Northern Ireland.
The police have wider powers of arrest and
detention under the Prevention of Terrorism
Act than under the general criminal law when
dealing with suspected terrorists. They can
arrest and detain someone for up to 48 hours
(and for a further five days if a Secretary of
State approves) on reasonable suspicion of
involvement in terrorism. They also have
powers to conduct security checks at ports,
and special investigative powers for offences
relating to the financing of terrorism.
Extended police powers to stop and search
pedestrians, to search non-residential premises
and unaccompanied goods at ports, to impose
cordons, and to restrict parking and remove
vehicles were introduced under the Prevention
of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Act 1996.
Northern Ireland
Powers similar to those provided in England
and Wales under the Prevention of Terrorism
91
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
(Additional Powers) Act 1996 have existed for
a number of years in Northern Ireland under
successive Northern Ireland (Emergency
Provisions) Acts, which have a fixed lifespan.
Despite the ceasefires declared by the
paramilitary groupings in Northern Ireland in
1994, the previous Government did not think
it prudent to remove from the statute book the
protection provided by the emergency
legislation while illegal weaponry and
explosives were still at large.
The Provisional Irish Republican Army
reverted to violence, from February 1996, in
mainland Britain and in Northern Ireland, but
declared a resumption of its ceasefire in July
1997 (see below).
Control of Weapons
Britain has strict legislative controls on
firearms. The police license the possession of
firearms and have powers to regulate their
safekeeping and movement. A ban on the
private ownership of machine guns, high-
powered self-loading rifles and burst-fire
weapons has been extended under new
legislation in 1997 to include all handguns.
It is illegal to manufacture, sell or import
certain weapons such as knuckledusters and
swordsticks. The law relating to knives has
recently been strengthened, with higher
penalties for carrying a knife in a public place
without good reason, new measures against
the marketing of knives, and extended stop
and search powers for the police.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The Home Secretary and the Scottish and
Northern Ireland Secretaries, together with
police authorities and chief constables, are
responsible for providing an effective and
efficient police service in Britain.
Organisation
There are 52 police forces in Britain, mainly
organised on a local basis—43 in England and
Wales, eight in Scotland and one (the Royal
Ulster Constabulary) in Northern Ireland.
The Metropolitan Police Service and the City
of London force are responsible for policing
London. The police service is financed by
central and local government.
At the end of March 1997 police strength in
England and Wales was about 127,150, of
which the Metropolitan Police numbered
around 27,000. The establishment of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was around
8.500. Police strength in Scotland was about
14.500. With the exception of the RUC, each
force has volunteer special constables who
perform police duties in their spare time,
without pay, acting in support of regular
officers. There are currently about 20,000
special constables. In Northern Ireland there
is a 5,000-strong reserve force.
Police forces are maintained in England and
Wales by local police authorities. In the 41
police areas outside London, police authorities
normally have 17 members—nine locally
elected councillors, three magistrates and five
independent members. A 12-member
Metropolitan Police Committee assists the
Home Secretary, currently the police authority
for the Metropolitan Police. For the City of
London Police the authority is a committee of
the Corporation of London. Police authorities,
in consultation with the chief constables and
local community, set local policing objectives,
while the Government sets key objectives for
the police as a whole. The police authorities in
Scotland are composed of elected councillors.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
appoints the police authority.
Provincial forces are headed by chief
constables (appointed by their police
authorities with the Secretary of State’s
approval), who are responsible for the
direction and control of their police forces and
for the appointment, promotion and discipline
of all ranks below assistant chief constable. On
matters of efficiency they are generally
answerable to their police authorities. In the
Metropolitan Police District the commissioner
of police is appointed by royal warrant on the
recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Police forces are overseen by independent
inspectors of constabulary, whose reports to
central government are published.
Police officers are not allowed to join a
trade union or to go on strike. All ranks,
however, have their own staff associations.

JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Co-ordination of Operations
The National Criminal Intelligence Service
(NCIS) has the leading role in collecting and
analysing criminal intelligence for use by
police forces and other law enforcement
agencies in Britain. The NCIS has a
headquarters and south-east regional office in
London, with five other regional offices in
England and an office in Scotland. It acts as
co-ordinator for the activities of the Security
Service in support of the law enforcement
agencies against organised crime, and liaises
with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL), which promotes
international co-operation between police
forces. New legislation—the Police Act
1997—provides for the NCIS, currently part
of the Home Office, to be put on a statutory
footing outside central government.
There are six regional crime squads in
England and Wales, and a Scottish Crime
Squad, which investigate serious crime
occurring across police force boundaries and
abroad. The Police Act 1997 contains powers
to establish a National Crime Squad in
England and Wales. The same legislation also
provides for the authorisation of intrusive
surveillance operations by the police and HM
Customs and Excise to be put on a statutory
basis.
Britain has taken a leading role in developing
a new European Union police agency
(EUROPOL) to provide EU-wide intelligence
about serious crime; in 1996, it was the first EU
member state to ratify the convention giving
EUROPOL legal status. The NCIS provides
the channel for communication between Britain
and EUROPOL.
Access to Information
The Police Information Technology
Organisation (PITO), launched in 1996, is
responsible for specifying and procuring the
delivery of national information technology
systems (such as the Police National Computer)
for the police service, and for promoting the
National Strategy for Police Information
Systems (which develops common information
technology applications) at force level. The
PITO will become a non-departmental public
body (see p. 74) in April 1998.
The Police National Computer provides all
police forces in Britain with rapid 24-hour-a-
day access to operationally essential
information. Phoenix, the Criminal Justice
Record Service, gives the police direct on-line
access to national records of arrests, cautions,
bail decisions and convictions. This is
gradually replacing the manual record-keeping
service maintained on microfiche by the
National Identification Service (NIS).
Phoenix will eventually provide information
direct to other criminal justice agencies.
Under the Police Act 1997, new
arrangements are being made for the disclosure
of criminal records information for employment
and related purposes in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. In Scotland criminal record
checks are undertaken by the Scottish Criminal
Records Office (SCRO). The SCRO has an
automatic national fingerprint record system; a
similar national system in England and Wales
(NAFIS) is being implemented from 1997-98.
Forensic Science Service
The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is a
Home Office executive agency. It provides
scientific support in the investigation of crime
and expert evidence to the courts. Its
customers include the police, the Crown
Prosecution Service, coroners and defence
solicitors. In 1996 the FSS merged with the
Metropolitan Police Forensic Science
Laboratory to form a single agency serving all
police forces in England and Wales through
six regional laboratories. The FSS operates
the national DNA database (see p. 95).
In Scotland forensic science services are
provided by forces’ own laboratories. Northern
Ireland has its own forensic science laboratory.
Powers and Procedures
(For information on police powers relating to
the prevention of terrorism, see p. 91.)
England and Wales
Police powers and procedures in criminal
investigation and apprehension are defined by
legislation and accompanying codes of
practice. A police officer is liable to
93
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
disciplinary proceedings if he or she fails to
comply with any provision of the codes, and
evidence obtained in breach of the codes may
be ruled inadmissible in court. The codes
must be readily available for consultation in all
police stations.
• Stop and search—Police officers have the
power to stop and search people and vehicles
if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting
that they will find stolen goods, offensive
weapons or implements that could be used for
theft, burglary and other offences. An officer
must make a record of the grounds for the
search and of anything found, and the person
stopped is entitled to a copy of the record. A
senior police officer (superintendent or above)
who reasonably believes that serious incidents
of violence may take place can authorise
uniformed officers to stop and search people
and vehicles for offensive weapons or
dangerous implements. The authorisation
must specify the timescale and area in which
the powers are to be exercised.
• Arrest—The police have various powers to
arrest people suspected of having committed
an offence. They may arrest on a warrant
issued by a court, but can arrest without
warrant for arrestable offences. An arrestable
offence is one for which the sentence is fixed
by law or for which the term of imprisonment
is five years or more. This category includes
serious arrestable offences such as murder,
rape and manslaughter. There is a general
power of arrest for all other offences if it is
impracticable or inappropriate to proceed by
way of summons to appear in court, or if a
police officer has reasonable grounds for
believing that an arrest is necessary to prevent
a suspect from causing injury to someone else
or damage to property.
• Detention and questioning—A person
suspected of an offence must be cautioned
before the police can ask any questions about
the offence: suspects must be informed that
they do not have to say anything, but anything
that they do say may be given in evidence in
court. The caution also tells suspects that it
may be harmful to their defence if they fail to
mention something during questioning which
they later rely on in court. A caution will also
be given in similar terms when a suspect is
charged. A court may draw inferences from a
defendant’s failure to mention facts when
questioned or charged.
The length of time that a suspect is held in
police custody before charge is strictly
regulated. For arrestable offences this may not
exceed 24 hours. A person suspected of
committing a serious arrestable offence can be
detained for up to 96 hours without charge,
but beyond 36 hours only if a warrant is
obtained from a magistrates’ court. Reviews
must be made of a person’s detention at
regular intervals to check whether the criteria
for detention are still satisfied.
Interviews with suspects at police stations
must be tape-recorded when the police are
investigating indictable offences and in certain
other cases. The police are not precluded from
taping interviews for other types of offence.
Suspects are entitled to a copy of the
recording if they are charged or informed that
they will be prosecuted.
Someone who thinks that the grounds for
his or her detention are unlawful may apply to
the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus
against the person responsible, requiring that
person to appear before the court to justify the
detention. Habeas corpus proceedings take
precedence over others.
• Charging—Once there is sufficient
evidence, the police have to decide whether a
detained person should be charged with an
offence. If the police institute criminal
proceedings against a person, the Crown
Prosecution Service (see p. 96) then takes
control of the case.
Scotland
The police in Scotland can arrest someone
without a warrant if he or she is seen
committing a crime or is reasonably suspected
of an offence against laws controlling the use
of drugs. In other cases the police may seek a
warrant to arrest a person suspected of a crime
by applying to a Justice of the Peace (JP—see
p. 97).
As in England and Wales, Scottish police
have powers to enter a building without a
warrant if they are pursuing someone who has
94
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
committed, or attempted to commit, a serious
crime. A court can grant the police a search
warrant giving them the power to search
premises for stated items in connection with a
crime. The police may search anyone
suspected of carrying an offensive weapon.
Anyone suspected of an imprisonable
offence may be detained for questioning by
the police without being arrested, but for no
more than six hours without being charged.
When someone is arrested, they must be
charged and cautioned that they need say
nothing but that anything that is said may be
given in evidence. The case is then referred to
the procurator fiscal (see p. 97). Failure to
caution a suspect, or unreasonable harshness
in questioning by the police, may result in any
alleged confession being considered
inadmissible in court.
Tape recording of interviews with suspects
is common practice.
Northern Ireland
The law in Northern Ireland relating to the
powers of the police in the investigation of
crime and to evidence in criminal proceedings
is very similar to that in force in England and
Wales.
DNA Testing
The police may take certain body samples for
DNA analysis from people detained or
convicted for a recordable offence, and use the
samples to search against existing records of
convicted offenders or unsolved crimes. A
national DNA database, the first of its kind in
the world, was introduced in 1995.
Firearms
Police officers in Great Britain do not normally
carry firearms. About five per cent of officers
are allowed to be issued with firearms, on the
authority of a senior officer, where there is a
special need. Most forces operate armed
response vehicles which can be deployed
quickly to contain firearms incidents. In
Northern Ireland police officers are issued with
firearms for their personal protection.
Police Discipline
A police officer may be prosecuted if
suspected of a criminal offence. Officers are
also subject to a disciplinary code designed to
deter abuse of police powers and maintain
public confidence in police impartiality. If
found guilty of breaching the code, an officer
can be dismissed from the force.
Members of the public can make
complaints against police officers if they feel
that they have been treated unfairly or
improperly. In England and Wales the
investigation of such complaints by the force
concerned is overseen, or in more serious cases
supervised, by the independent Police
Complaints Authority. In Scotland complaints
against police officers involving allegations of
criminal conduct are referred to the
procurator fiscal for investigation. The
Scottish Inspectorate of Constabulary
considers representations from complainants
dissatisfied with the way the police have
handled their complaints.
In Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints is required
to supervise the investigation of complaints
regarding death or serious injury and has the
power to supervise that of any other
complaint.
Community Relations
Within every police authority there are
police/community liaison consultative
arrangements, drawing in representatives from
the police, local councillors and community
groups. Efforts are made to develop relations
with young people through greater contact
with schools.
All police officers should receive training in
community and race relations issues. Home
Office and police service initiatives aim to
ensure that racially motivated crime is treated
as a police priority. Forces’ responses to racial
incidents are monitored by the Inspectorate of
Constabulary. Discriminatory behaviour by
police officers, towards either other officers or
members of the public, is an offence under the
police disciplinary code.
Police forces recognise the need to recruit
more women and members of the ethnic
minorities in order to ensure the police fully
95
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
represent the community. Each force has an
equal opportunities policy.
PROSECUTION AND THE CRIMINAL
COURTS
Awaiting Trial
England and Wales
If someone is charged with an offence, he or
she may be released on bail to attend a
magistrates’ court. When bail is not granted
by the police, the defendant must be brought
before a magistrates’ court as soon as possible.
Although all those accused of offences have
a general right to bail, magistrates may
withhold bail if there are substantial grounds
for believing that an accused person would
abscond, commit an offence, interfere with
witnesses, or otherwise obstruct the course of
justice. Recent legislation has removed the
presumption in favour of bail for people
alleged to have offended while on bail, and
also removes the right to bail for someone
charged with murder, manslaughter or rape if
previously convicted of the same offence.
If bail is refused by the magistrates, the
defendant is entitled to apply to the Crown
Court or the High Court judge in chambers
and must be informed of this right. In certain
circumstances the prosecution may appeal to a
Crown Court judge against the granting of bail
by magistrates.
Scotland
When arrested, an accused person in Scotland
may be released by the police to await
summons, on an undertaking to appear at
court at a specified time, or be held in custody
to appear at court on the next working day.
Following that appearance, the accused person
may be remanded in custody until trial or
released by the court on bail. If released on
bail, the accused person must undertake to
appear at trial when required, not to commit
an offence while on bail, and not to interfere
with witnesses or obstruct the course of
justice. The court may also impose additional
conditions on the accused (for example, to
keep away from certain people or locations).
There is a right of appeal to the High Court
by an accused person against the refusal of
bail, or by the prosecutor against the granting
of bail, or by either against the conditions
imposed.
Bail will not be granted where an accused
person is charged with murder, attempted
murder, culpable homicide, rape or attempted
rape and has a previous conviction for such a
crime (in the case of culpable homicide,
involving a prison sentence).
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland bail may be granted by a
resident magistrate except in cases dealt with
under emergency provisions, where the
decision is made by a judge of the High Court.
Prosecution Arrangements
England and Wales
Once the police have charged a person with a
criminal offence, the independent Crown
Prosecution Service (CPS) takes control of the
case, reviews the evidence and advises the
police on whether the case should be
continued. A prosecution will proceed only if
the prosecutor is satisfied that there is, on the
evidence, a realistic prospect of conviction,
and if so, that it is in the public interest for the
prosecution to proceed.
The CPS is headed by the Director of
Public Prosecutions, who is accountable to
Parliament through the Attorney General. It is
at present divided into 13 geographical areas,
each headed by a Chief Crown Prosecutor,
and below these there are 98 branches. Every
The new Government is decentralising the
structure of the CPS, so that there will be a
one-to-one relationship between a police
force and its corresponding CPS area, with
the aim of making co-operation more
effective. By April 1998 the CPS will be
divided into 42 new areas—one for each
police force outside London, with the
Metropolitan Police and City of London
Police being served by one CPS area—each
having its own Chief Crown Prosecutor.
96
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
branch has a number of teams, each of which
is responsible for casework from particular
police divisions and feeding into particular
courts. A fourteenth area—Central
Casework—deals with some especially
sensitive cases, including terrorist offences
and breaches of the Official Secrets Act.
Scotland
The Lord Advocate is responsible for
prosecutions in the High Court of Justiciary,
sheriff courts and district courts. The High
Court of Justiciary will only grant the right to
prosecute to a private person in very
exceptional cases. The Lord Advocate is
advised by the Crown Agent, who is head of
the Procurator Fiscal Service and is assisted in
the Crown Office by a staff of legally qualified
civil servants.
Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by procurators fiscal
and Crown Office officials. They are
conducted by the Lord Advocate, the Solicitor
General for Scotland (the Lord Advocate’s
ministerial deputy) and advocate deputes,
collectively known as Crown Counsel.
Crimes tried before the sheriff and district
courts are prepared and prosecuted by
procurators fiscal. The police and other law
enforcement agencies investigate crimes and
offences and report to the procurator fiscal,
who decides whether to prosecute, subject to
the directions of Crown Counsel.
Northern Ireland
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, appointed by the Attorney
General, prosecutes all offences tried on
indictment and may do so in other (summary)
cases. Most summary offences are prosecuted
by the police.
Prosecutions for Fraud
The Serious Fraud Office prosecutes the most
serious and complex cases of fraud in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Investigations
are conducted by teams of lawyers,
accountants, police officers and other
specialists. In Scotland the Crown Office
Fraud Unit, which is part of the public
prosecution service, directs the investigation
and preparation for prosecution of serious and
complex fraud cases.
Courts
England and Wales
Very serious offences such as murder,
manslaughter, rape and robbery can only be
tried on indictment in the Crown Court,
where all contested trials are presided over by
a judge sitting with a jury. Summary offences
(the less serious offences and the vast majority
of criminal cases) are tried by unpaid lay
magistrates or, in a few areas, by a single paid
stipendiary magistrate; both sit without a jury.
Offences in a third category, such as theft,
the less serious cases of burglary and some
assaults, are known as ‘either way’ offences.
They can be tried either by magistrates or by
jury in the Crown Court. If magistrates are
content to deal with the case, the accused
person has the right to choose either trial by
magistrates or trial by jury in the Crown
Court.
All those charged with offences triable in
the Crown Court must first appear before a
magistrates’ court, which decides whether to
commit them to the Crown Court for trial. In
committal proceedings a magistrates’ court
considers only documentary evidence and
exhibits submitted by the prosecution,
together with representations by both parties,
when determining whether there is a case to
answer. No witnesses are called to give
evidence or be cross-examined.
A magistrates’ court usually consists of
three lay magistrates, known as Justices of the
Peace (JPs), who are advised by a legally
qualified clerk or a qualified assistant. There
are about 30,000 lay magistrates serving some
400 courts. The few full-time, legally qualified
stipendiary magistrates may sit alone and
usually preside in courts where the workload
is heavy. Magistrates’ courts are open to the
public and the media.
Most cases involving people under 18 are
heard in youth courts. These are specialist
magistrates’ courts which either sit apart from
other courts or are held at a different time.
97
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
Restrictions are placed on access by ordinary
members of the public.
Where a young person under 18 is charged
jointly with someone aged 18 or over, the case
may be heard in an ordinary magistrates’ court
or the Crown Court. If the young person is
found guilty, the court may transfer the case
to a youth court for sentence.
An independent inspectorate monitors the
administration of magistrates’ courts in order
to assess performance and spread good
practice. It does not comment on the judicial
decisions of magistrates or their clerks in
particular cases.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 venues,
in six regional areas called circuits, and is
presided over by High Court judges, full-time
circuit judges and part-time recorders. The
kind of judge chosen to preside over a case
depends on its complexity and seriousness.
A Charter for Court Users sets out
standards of service in the High Court, Crown
Court and county courts in England and
Wales, covering areas such as witness and
juror care, and correspondence and
complaints handling. The Charter does not
cover the judiciary. Magistrates’ courts are
developing their own charters.
Scotland
The High Court of Justiciary tries the most
serious crimes and has exclusive jurisdiction in
cases involving murder, treason and rape. The
sheriff court is concerned with less serious
offences and the district court with minor
offences.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard under
solemn or summary procedure. In solemn
procedure, an accused person’s trial takes
place before a judge sitting with a jury of 15
people. As in England and Wales, details of
the alleged offence are set out in a document
called an indictment. In summary procedure
the judge sits without a jury.
All cases in the High Court and the more
serious ones in sheriff courts are tried by a
judge and jury. Summary procedure is used in
the less serious cases in the sheriff courts, and
in all cases in the district courts. District court
judges are lay magistrates. In Glasgow there
are also stipendiary magistrates, who are full¬
time lawyers with the same powers as a sheriff
in summary procedure.
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence are normally dealt with by children’s
hearings (see p. 108).
Northern Ireland
Cases involving minor summary offences are
heard by magistrates’ courts presided over by
a full-time, legally qualified resident
magistrate. Young offenders under 17 are
dealt with by a juvenile court consisting of the
resident magistrate and two specially qualified
lay members, at least one of whom must be a
woman.
The Crown Court deals with criminal trials
on indictment. It is served by High Court and
county court judges. Contested cases are heard
by a judge and jury, although people charged
with terrorist-type offences are tried by a
judge sitting alone because of the possibility of
jurors being intimidated by terrorist
organisations.
In non-jury Crown Court trials the onus
remains on the prosecution to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt, and defendants have
the right to be represented by a lawyer of their
choice. The judge must set out in a written
statement the reasons for convicting, and there
is an automatic right of appeal against
conviction and sentence on points of fact as
well as law.
Trial
Criminal trials in Britain have two parties: the
prosecution and the defence. The law
presumes the innocence of an accused person
until guilt has been proved by the prosecution.
An accused person has the right to employ a
legal adviser and may be granted legal aid
from public funds (see p. 112). If remanded in
custody, he or she may be visited by a legal
adviser to ensure a properly prepared defence.
Pre-Trial Preparation
The Criminal Procedures and Investigations
Act 1996 has amended the law in England and
Wales on prosecution and defence disclosure
of evidence, and introduced other measures
98
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
relating to pre-trial procedures. Since April
1997, a new statutory scheme (also applicable
in Northern Ireland) places limits on what the
police and prosecution must disclose to the
defence, with protection for sensitive material
such as the identity of informants. The
defence is required to disclose before the trial
the general nature of its case, and the matters
on which it takes issue with the prosecution,
with its reasons. Defence disclosure is
mandatory in the Crown Court.
The 1996 legislation has also:
• created a statutory scheme for pre-trial
hearings in the Crown Court in England
and Wales, with the aim of ensuring that
potentially difficult cases come to court
as well prepared as they can be; and
• given judges a new power to make a
binding ruling on the admissibility of
evidence or other point of law in any case
before the start of a trial.
In Scotland, the court in summary cases is
required to call an additional hearing
(intermediate diet) at some time between the
first court appearance and the trial to establish
the state of readiness of both the defence and
the prosecution. In solemn procedure, once an
accused person has had the opportunity of
consulting a solicitor, he or she may go before a
sheriff for judicial examination, which takes place
in private. A record of the examination may be
used in evidence at a subsequent trial. Solemn
procedure in the sheriff court requires a hearing,
like that held in summary cases, to find out
whether the case is ready to go to trial. The
prosecution in solemn cases must give the
defence advance notice of the witnesses it intends
to call and of the documents and other items on
which it will rely. In summary cases this is
usually done as a matter of practice, although
there is no obligation on the Crown to do so.
Trial Procedure
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court and rules of evidence are rigorously
applied. Certain evidence is excluded because
it is unduly prejudicial to the defendant,
inherently unreliable, or its utterance is
against the public interest. If evidence is
improperly admitted or excluded a conviction
can be quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine prosecution
witnesses. The defendant can call his or her
own witnesses who, if they will not attend
voluntarily, may be legally compelled to do
so. The defendant can also address the court
in person or through a lawyer, the defence
having the right to the last speech before the
judge sums up. The defendant cannot be
questioned without consenting to be sworn as
a witness in his or her owtl defence.
Child Witnesses
Legislation in 1988 tackled the presumption
in England and Wales that children were
incompetent as witnesses, and introduced the
system which allows children to give their
evidence at court by means of a closed-circuit
television link. Subsequent legislation, which
has abolished the presumption, extends the
closed-circuit television provisions, forbids
the cross-examination of a child directly by
the accused, and provides for a video-
recorded interview with a child victim or
witness to be admissible in court as his or her
main evidence. Judges are required to admit
the evidence of a child unless he or she is
incapable of giving intelligible testimony.
The jury must decide what weight should be
placed on a child’s evidence. These
provisions have been replicated in Northern
Ireland.
In Scotland live television links installed
in a number of criminal courts enable
children (and, from August 1997, certain
categories of vulnerable adults) to give their
evidence without entering the courtroom.
Evidence may also be given from behind a
screen in the courtroom. In addition, there is
provision for a child to give video-recorded
evidence before and during the trial. The
child who has given evidence in this manner
is not subject to cross-examination on that
evidence in court.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the evidence for the jury, and
99
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
the jury verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’,
the latter resulting in acquittal. If the jury
cannot reach a unanimous decision, the judge
may allow a majority verdict provided that, in
the normal jury of 12 people, there are no
more than two dissenters. In Scotland the
jury’s verdict may be ‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’ or
‘not proven’; the accused is acquitted if either
of the last two verdicts is given. A Scottish
jury consists of 15 people and a verdict of
‘guilty’ can be reached only if at least eight
members are in favour.
If the jury acquits the defendant, the
prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same
offence. However, there is provision for retrial
of an acquitted person if the acquittal has been
tainted by a subsequent conviction for
interfering with, or intimidating, a juror or
witness in the proceedings which resulted in
the acquittal.
A jury is independent of the judiciary and
any attempt to interfere with its members is a
criminal offence. Jurors are selected from a pool
of potential jurors before the start of a trial.
Both the prosecution and the defence may
object to particular jurors. People between the
ages of 18 and 70 (65 in Scotland) whose names
appear on the electoral register are, with certain
exceptions, liable for jury service and their
names are chosen at random. Ineligible people
include judges and people who have been
members of the legal profession or the police,
prison or probation services within the previous
ten years. Those convicted of certain offences
within the previous ten years cannot serve on a
jury. Anyone who has received a prison
sentence of five years or more is disqualified for
life. People on bail are also ineligible.
Sentencing
If a person is convicted, the court decides on
the most appropriate sentence, taking into
account the facts of the offence, the
circumstances of the offender, any previous
convictions or sentences and any statutory
limits on sentencing. The defence lawyer may
make a speech in mitigation.
Courts in England and Wales must obtain a
‘pre-sentence’ report from the probation
service on offenders under the age of 18 in cases
involving an offence triable either way before
passing a custodial or more complex
community sentence. In most other
circumstances, such reports are discretionary.
In Scottish cases a court must obtain a social
enquiry report before imposing a custodial
sentence if the accused is under 21 or has not
previously served a custodial sentence. A report
is also required before making a probation or
community service order (see p. 102), or in
cases involving people subject to supervision.
Courts may take into account, when
deciding the appropriate sentence, the fact that
an accused person pleaded guilty, and the
timing and circumstances in which the plea was
made.
Confiscation of Criminal Proceeds
Courts in Britain have wide powers to order
the confiscation of profits made by drug
traffickers and other criminals. These were
first introduced in 1986, in relation to the
proceeds of drug trafficking, and have since
been strengthened and extended to the
proceeds of other serious crimes. The amount
owing under a confiscation order is liable to
forfeiture even when the offender has served a
term of imprisonment in default for failing to
pay the order. Britain co-operates with a
number of countries in freezing and
confiscating the proceeds of serious crime.
There are heavy penalties for those who
launder money gained from any sort of serious
crime.'
Appeals
England and Wales
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the Crown Court against the
sentence if he or she has pleaded guilty. An
appeal may be made against both conviction
and sentence, or sentence alone, if a ‘not
guilty’ plea has been made. The High Court
1 Money-laundering is the process by which illegally obtained
money or other property—from drugs or arms trafficking,
terrorist activities or other serious crimes—is given the appearance
of having originated from a legitimate source.
100
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
hears appeals on points of law and procedure,
by either prosecution or defence, in cases
originally dealt with by magistrates. If
convicted by the Crown Court, a defendant
may seek leave to appeal to the Court of
Appeal (Criminal Division) against both the
conviction and the sentence imposed. The
House of Lords is the final appeal court, but
will only consider cases that involve a point of
law of general public importance and where
leave to appeal is granted.
The Attorney General may seek a ruling of
the Court of Appeal on a point of law which
has been material in a case where a person is
tried on indictment. The Court has power to
refer the point to the House of Lords if
necessary. The ruling will constitute a binding
precedent, but an acquittal in the original case
is not affected.
The Attorney General can apply for leave
to refer to the Court of Appeal a sentence
which, in his or her view, appears unduly
lenient. This power covers offences triable on
indictment and certain offences triable either
way (where sentence has been passed in the
Crown Court). Such triable either way
offences are indecent assault, making threats
to kill, and cruelty to, or neglect of, a child.
The Attorney General’s power also covers
certain types of serious or complex fraud. The
Court of Appeal may, if it decides to quash the
original sentence, impose in its place any
sentence which the original sentencing court
had the power to impose.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission,
established in January 1997, operates in
England and Wales and in Northern Ireland.
This body, independent of both Government
and the courts, examines possible miscarriages
of justice in cases tried on indictment or
summarily and decides whether to refer them
to the courts on the grounds of sentence and
conviction. It directs and supervises
investigations undertaken on its behalf and
approves the appointment of investigating
officers. Referral of a case requires some new
argument or evidence not previously raised at
the trial or on appeal.
The final decision on any case referred rests
with the respective Courts of AppeaGn
England and Wales and Northern Ireland (if
the case was tried originally on indictment) or
with the Crown Court following a referral in a
summary case.
The Court of Appeal will allow any appeal
where it considers the conviction unsafe and
will dismiss it in any other case.
Scotland
All appeal cases are dealt with by the High
Court of Justiciary. In both solemn and
summary procedure, a convicted person may
appeal against conviction, or sentence, or both.
The Court may authorise a retrial if it sets aside
a conviction. There is no further appeal to the
House of Lords. In summary proceedings the
prosecutor may appeal on a point of law against
acquittal or sentence. The Lord Advocate may
seek the opinion of the High Court on a point
of law in a case where a person tried on
indictment is acquitted. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected. The Crown has a
right of appeal against lenient sentences in both
solemn and summary procedure.
Legislation passed in 1995 introduced a
requirement for leave to appeal. This involves
a single judge assessing whether there are
arguable grounds for an appeal. The
legislation also reduced the number of High
Court judges required to consider appeals
against sentence only from three to two.
A person convicted on indictment may
petition the Secretary of State to refer the case
to the High Court on the ground that a
miscarriage of justice has occurred. If the case
is referred, then it will be dealt with as though
it were a normal appeal.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, appeals from magistrates’
courts against conviction or sentence are heard
by the county court. An appeal on a point of law
alone can be heard by the Northern Ireland
Court of Appeal, which also hears appeals from
the Crown Court against conviction and/or
sentence. Procedures for a further appeal to the
House of Lords are similar to those in England
and Wales.
A person convicted of a terrorist offence in
a non-jury court has an automatic right of
appeal against conviction and/or sentence.
101
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
The new Criminal Cases Review
Commission operates in Northern Ireland as
well as in England and Wales.
Coroners’ Courts
In England and Wales the coroner (usually a
senior lawyer or doctor) must hold an inquest
if the deceased died a violent or unnatural
death, a sudden death where the cause is
unknown, or in prison or in other specified
circumstances. In Northern Ireland in such
circumstances the coroner investigates the
matter to decide whether an inquest is
necessary. The coroner’s court establishes
how, when and where the deceased died. A
coroner may sit alone or, in certain
circumstances, with a jury.
In Scotland the local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the findings
to the Crown Office. When appropriate a fatal
accident inquiry may be held before the
sheriff; this is mandatory in cases of death
resulting from industrial accidents and of
deaths in custody.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
Non-custodial Sentences
A range of non-custodial sentences is available
to the courts (see also Young Offenders—p.
107). These include:
Fines
About 75 per cent of offenders are punished
with a fine. There is no limit to the fine
which the Crown Court (and High Court of
Justiciary and the sheriff court in Scotland
under solemn procedure) may impose on
indictment. The maximum fine that can be
imposed by a magistrates’ court in England
and Wales (and a sheriff court in Scotland
under summary procedure) is £5,000. When
fixing the amount of a fine, courts are
required to reflect the seriousness of the
offence and to take into account the financial
circumstances of the offender.
Probation
The locally organised probation service in
England and Wales supervises offenders in the
community under direct court orders and after
release from custody. It also provides
offenders in custody with help and advice.
A court probation order requires offenders
to maintain regular contact with their
probation officer, who is expected to supervise
them and confront them with the
consequences of their offence. Probation is
intended as a punishment, although the time
spent by offenders under supervision in the
community offers an opportunity for
constructive work to reduce the likelihood of
reoffending. A probation order can last from
six months to three years; an offender who
fails to comply with any of the requirements of
the order can be brought before the court
again. The probation service also administers
some supervision orders and supervises those
subject to community service orders and those
released from prison on parole.
HM Inspectorate of Probation monitors the
work of the voluntary and private sectors with
the probation service, in addition to its
inspection and advisory duties.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation,
community service and other community
disposals, and offenders subject to supervision
on release from custody.
In Northern Ireland the probation service is
administered by the government-funded
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Community Service
In England and Wales offenders aged 16 or
over convicted of imprisonable offences may
be given community service orders. The court
may order between 40 and 240 hours’ unpaid
service to be completed within 12 months.
Examples of work done include decorating the
houses of elderly or disabled people and
building adventure playgrounds for children.
From January 1998, community service orders
for periods of between 20 and 100 hours for
fine defaulters and persistent petty offenders
will be piloted.
102
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
In Scotland the minimum number of hours
for which a community service order can be
made is 80 and the maximum, in higher
courts, is 300.
Combination Order
A court may impose an order which combines
probation and community service elements on
an offender aged 16 or over who has been
convicted of an imprisonable offence. The
probation element may be of one to three
years’ duration, the community service
element of between 40 to 100 hours.
Electronic Monitoring
The use of curfew orders with electronic
monitoring was introduced in 1995 in three
trial areas in England and Wales for offenders
aged 16 and over. Offenders sentenced to the
order are required to remain at a place or
places specified by the court for between two
and 12 hours a day for up to six months. The
Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 contains
provisions to extend courts’ powers to impose
a curfew order, monitored by electronic
tagging, to offenders aged 10 to 15. In July
1997 the new Government announced that the
current trials would be extended to other
areas, and that there would be pilot projects
for tagging those on bail, fine defaulters,
persistent petty offenders and juveniles.
In Scotland the Crime and Punishment
(Scotland) Act 1997 includes provision for the
introduction of a restriction of liberty order,
enabling the courts to curtail an offender’s
movements for up to 12 hours a day for 12
months using electronic monitoring. The new
Government has announced that it intends to
set up pilot schemes in selected courts.
Scottish legislation does not provide for the
‘tagging’ of offenders aged under 16.
Supervised Attendance Order
In Scotland supervised attendance order
schemes operate in a number of areas, and will
be available to all Scottish courts in 1998.
These provide an alternative to imprisonment
for fine default, and incorporate aspects of
work and training. Their use as an alternative
in the first instance to fines for young
offenders is being piloted in selected areas.
Compensation
The courts may order an offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence.
Compensation takes precedence over fines.
Other Measures
A court in England and Wales may discharge a
person either absolutely or conditionally if it
believes that it is not necessary to inflict
punishment. If conditionally discharged, the
offender remains liable to punishment for the
offence if convicted of another offence within
a period specified by the court (not more than
three years).
Courts may also require an offender to keep
the peace and/or be of good behaviour. If this
requirement is not complied with, the
offender is liable to forfeit a sum of money.
Similar powers are available to courts in
Northern Ireland.
Courts have the power to defer sentence, so
as to enable the court, in subsequent dealings
with the offender, to consider his or her
conduct or any changes in circumstances.
The police have discretion whether to
charge an offender or formally to caution him
or her. Cautioning is a form of warning and no
court action is taken. The new Government
proposes to end the practice of repeat
cautions, replacing them with a single final
warning. Cautioning is not available in
Scotland.
Custody
A custodial sentence is the most severe penalty
available to the courts. A court must explain to
the offender why it is passing a custodial
sentence, and the length of the sentence must
reflect the seriousness of the offence. There is
a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for
murder throughout Britain. Life imprisonment
is the maximum penalty for a number of
serious offences such as robbery, rape, arson
and manslaughter. Since October 1997 the
103
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
courts in England and Wales have been
required to impose automatic life sentences on
those convicted for a second time of a serious
violent or sexual offence.
England and Wales
A magistrates’ court cannot impose a term of
more than six months’ imprisonment for an
individual offence tried summarily. It can
impose consecutive sentences for ‘either way’
offences, subject to an overall maximum of 12
months’ imprisonment. If an offence carries a
higher maximum penalty, the court may
commit the offender for sentence at the Crown
Court. The Crown Court may impose a
custodial sentence for any term up to life,
depending on the seriousness of the offence and
the maximum penalty available.
If a court decides that an offence is
sufficiently serious to justify an immediate
custodial sentence of not more than two years,
the sentence may be suspended for a period of
at least one year and not more than two years if
exceptional circumstances justify the
suspension. If the offender commits another
imprisonable offence during the period of
suspension, the court may order the suspended
sentence to be served as well as any punishment
imposed for the second offence. When passing a
suspended sentence, the court must consider
whether it would also be appropriate to impose
a fine or make a compensation order. The court
may also order the offender to be supervised by
a probation officer if the suspended sentence is
for more than six months.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the position is generally
the same as for England and Wales. A
magistrates’ court, however, cannot commit an
offender for sentencing at the Crown Court if
it has tried the case.
Scotland
In Scottish trials on indictment the High
Court of Justiciary may impose a sentence of
imprisonment for any term up to life, and the
sheriff court any term up to three years. The
sheriff court may send any person to the High
Court for sentence if the court considers its
powers are insufficient. In summary cases the
sheriff or stipendiary magistrate may normally
impose up to three months’ imprisonment or
six months for some repeated offences. The
district court can impose a maximum term of
imprisonment of 60 days.
The Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act
1997 includes provision for increases in the
sentencing powers of the sheriff and district
courts; implementation of this is under
consideration by the new Government.
Prisons
The Prison Service in England and Wales, the
Scottish Prison Service and the Northern
Ireland Prison Service are all executive
agencies. Government ministers remain
accountable for policy, while agencies’ chief
executives (the Director General in the case of
England and Wales) are responsible for the
delivery of services.
Prisoners are housed in accommodation
ranging from open prisons to high security
establishments. In England, Wales and
Scotland sentenced prisoners are classified
into different risk-level groups for security
purposes. Women prisoners are held in
separate prisons or in separate accommodation
in mixed prisons. There are no open prisons
in Northern Ireland, where the majority of
offenders are serving sentences for terrorist
offences. People awaiting trial in custody have
certain rights and privileges not granted to
convicted prisoners. Where possible, they are
separated from prisoners who have been
convicted and sentenced.
There are currently 133 prison
establishments in England and Wales and 22
in Scotland. Thirty-seven establishments in
England and Wales hold prisoners under the
age of 21 (22 of which are dedicated to such
offenders only) and five cater for them in
Scotland. Northern Ireland has three prisons
and one young offenders’ centre.
In 1996 the average prison population was
55,280 in England and Wales, 5,900 in
Scotland and 1,640 in Northern Ireland. The
prison population in Great Britain fell in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, but has been
growing since 1993. In Northern Ireland it has
fallen by 17 per cent since 1987.
104
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Although many prisons were built in the
19th century, there has been a refurbishment
and prison-building programme over recent
years. All prisoners in England and Wales now
have access to sanitation 24 hours a day, as do
an increasing proportion (two-thirds) in
Scotland.
Private Sector Involvement
The Home Secretary has the power to
contract out the management of prisons in
England and Wales to the private sector, as
well as escort and guarding functions. Four
prisons (which remain part of the Prison
Service) are currently managed by private
contractors. Three prisons being built under
the Private Finance Initiative (PFI—see
chapter 11, p. 160) in Merseyside,
Nottinghamshire and south Wales are
expected to be in operation in 1998-99. In
Scotland a new prison near Kilmarnock is also
to be built under the PFI.
Early Release of Prisoners
At present, prisoners in England and Wales
sentenced to less than four years are released
once they have served half of their sentence.
Long-term prisoners (those sentenced to four
years or more) become eligible to be
considered for early release once they have
served half of their sentence; if not found
suitable for parole they are released
automatically at the two-thirds point. The
Parole Board has the final decision on the
early release of prisoners sentenced (after 1
October 1992) to four years or more, but less
than seven years. In other cases the Board
makes a recommendation to the Home
Secretary about a prisoner’s suitability for
parole. All prisoners sentenced to a year or
more are released on licence to be supervised
until the three-quarters point of the sentence.
If ordered by the sentencing court, sex
offenders may be supervised to the end of the
sentence. If convicted of another offence
punishable with imprisonment and committed
before the end of the original sentence, a
released prisoner may be required by the court
to serve all or part of the original sentence
outstanding at the time the fresh offence was
committed.
In Scotland similar arrangements apply
except that the Parole Board has the power to
release prisoners from halfway through their
sentence if they are serving between four and
ten years. Those serving 10 years or more may
only be released with the consent of the
Secretary of State. All prisoners sentenced to
four years or more are supervised from release
until the end of their sentence.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a
sentence of more than five days are eligible for
remission of half their sentence. Those
convicted of terrorist offences are eligible for
release at the halfway point in their sentence
but remain under licence (until the two-thirds
point) and may be subject to recall during that
period. If convicted of another terrorist offence
before the expiry of the original sentence, the
prisoner must complete that sentence before
serving any term for the second offence.
Life Sentence Prisoners
People serving life sentences for the murder of
police or prison officers, terrorist murders,
murder by firearms in the course of robbery
and the sexual or sadistic murder of children
are normally detained for at least 20 years.
The release on licence of prisoners serving
mandatory life sentences for murder may only
be authorised by the Home Secretary on the
recommendation of the Parole Board and after
consultation with the judiciary. A similar
policy applies in Scotland.
The Home Secretary is required to release
prisoners serving life sentences for offences
other than murder after an initial period set by
the trial judge if so directed by the Parole
Board. The Board has to be satisfied that the
protection of the public does not require their
further confinement. Similar procedures apply
in Scotland, and under the Crime and
Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 they will
extend to those serving life sentences for
murder committed while under the age of 18.
On release, life sentence prisoners remain
on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall if their behaviour suggests
that they might again be a danger to the
public.
105
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of
State reviews life sentence cases on the
recommendation of an internal review body.
Repatriation
Sentenced prisoners who are nationals of
countries which have ratified the Council of
Europe Convention on the Transfer of
Sentenced Persons, or similar international
arrangements, may apply to be returned to
their own country to serve the rest of their
sentence there.
Independent Oversight of the Prison System
Every prison and young offender institution in
England and Wales has a board of visitors.
Board members are volunteers drawn from the
local community and appointed by the Home
Secretary. They are independent of the prison
and the Prison Service, visit the prison often,
hear any complaints by prisoners and concerns
of staff, and report as necessary to the Home
Secretary. In Scotland, the visiting committees
to prisons are appointed by local authorities;
those to young offender institutions are
appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Independent Prisons Inspectorates report to
the respective Secretaries of State on the
treatment of prisoners and prison conditions.
Each establishment is visited about once in
every three years. The Inspectorates submit
annual reports to Parliament.
In England and Wales prisoners who fail to
get satisfaction from the Prison Service’s
internal request and complaints system may
complain to the Prisons Ombudsman. The
Ombudsman is independent of the Prison
Service and investigates complaints from
individual prisoners over decisions relating to
them which have been taken by Prison Service
staff, or other people working in prisons.
In Scotland, prisoners who exhaust the
internal grievance procedure may make
application to the Scottish Prisons Complaints
Commission, which is independent of the
Scottish Prison Service.
Prison Industries
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will help them when
released and to secure a return which will
reduce the cost of the prison system. The
main industries are clothing and textile
manufacture, engineering, woodwork,
laundering and horticulture. A few prisoners
are employed outside prison, some in
community service projects.
Prison Education
Education is compulsory for young people in
custody below school leaving age; otherwise it
is voluntary. There are many facilities
available for prisoners to gain vocational
qualifications, and some prisoners study for
public examinations, including those of the
Open University (see p. 453).
Physical education is compulsory for young
offenders, but otherwise voluntary. Practically
all prisons have physical education facilities.
Opportunities are given for inmates to obtain
sporting proficiency awards. Inmates also
compete against teams from the local
community.
Healthcare
The Health Care Service for Prisoners is
responsible for the physical and mental
healthcare of all those in prison custody in
England and Wales. A Health Advisory
Committee provides independent medical
advice to government ministers and the Prison
Service’s Director General and Director of
Health Care. Its overall objective is to ensure
that prisoners have access to the same range
and quality of services as do the general public
from the National Health Service (NHS).
In Scotland general medical services are
provided mainly by visiting general
practitioners (GPs—see chapter 24). Psychiatric
services are bought in from local health boards
responsible for the NHS. Psychological services
are provided partly in-house.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners may write and receive letters and be
visited by relatives and friends, and those in
all establishments in England, Wales and
Scotland may make telephone calls. Privileges
include a personal radio; books, periodicals
106
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
and newspapers; watching television; and the
opportunity to buy goods from the prison
shop with money earned in prison. Depending
on the facilities available, prisoners may be
granted the further privileges of dining and
recreation with other inmates.
Under the national framework for
incentives and earned privileges now in force
in all prisons in England and Wales, inmates
are required to earn privileges above a
minimum by good behaviour and
performance, and can lose them if they fail to
maintain acceptable standards.
Offences against prison discipline are dealt
with by prison governors, who act as
adjudicators. Measures to counter drug misuse
in prisons include mandatory drug testing.
Preparation for Release
The Prison Services have a duty to prepare
prisoners for release. Planning for safe release
starts at the beginning of an offender’s
sentence and ties in with the training,
education and work experience provided. It
aims to help prisoners reintegrate into society
and to cope with life without reoffending. Risk
assessment and confronting offending
behaviour are essential elements of this
process.
Prisoners may be released on temporary
licence for short periods but they are subject
to a rigorous risk assessment and are released
only for precisely defined and specific
activities which cannot be provided in prison
establishments.
The Pre-Release Employment Scheme in
England and Wales and the Training for
Freedom Scheme in Scotland enable selected
long-term prisoners to spend some time before
release in certain units or prisons in order to
help them readapt to society and renew ties
with their families. Prisoners in such units
work in paid employment in the community
and return to the unit each evening.
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving fixed
sentences may have short periods of pre¬
release home leave in their final period of
sentence. Fortnightly weekend home leave for
life sentence prisoners who have been
recommended for release was introduced in
1996.
Aftercare
Professional support is given to offenders after
release. All young offenders and all prisoners in
England and Wales sentenced to 12 months’
imprisonment and over are supervised on
release by the probation service, or, in the case
of certain young offenders, by local authority
social services departments.
In Scotland supervision on release is
provided by local authority social work services.
Young Offenders
England and Wales
Criminal proceedings cannot be brought
against children below the age of 10.
Offenders aged 10 to 17 years fall within the
jurisdiction of youth courts.
Existing non-custodial penalties for young
offenders include fines and compensation
orders (which the parents of offenders may be
ordered to pay), supervision orders and
attendance centre orders; 16- and 17-year-olds
may also be given the same probation,
community service and curfew sentences as
older offenders.
Under a supervision order, which can
remain in force for up to three years, a young
offender would normally live at home under
the supervision of a social worker or a
probation officer. The order may contain a
number of conditions including the
requirement for an offender to live in local
authority accommodation and/or participate
in specified activities at specified times.
A young offender found guilty of an
imprisonable offence can be ordered by the
courts to an attendance centre, as can an
offender who refuses to comply with another
order (for example, breach of a probation
order). The maximum number of hours of
attendance is 36 (or 24 if the offender is aged
under 16) spread over a period; the minimum
is 12 hours. The order aims to encourage
offenders to make more constructive use of
their leisure time.
Custodial sentences are available to the
courts where no other alternative is considered
to be appropriate. The main custodial
sentence for offenders aged 15 and over is
detention in a young offender institution.
107
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
Offenders aged 10 to 14 may also be detained
if convicted of murder, manslaughter, or other
serious offences for which an adult can be
jailed for 14 years or more (including rape,
arson and robbery). Post-release supervision is
carried out by a probation officer or local
authority social worker.
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act
1994 makes provision for five secure training
centres to accommodate persistent offenders
aged between 12 and 14. Secure training
orders, imposed by the court, will mean a
period of detention in a centre followed by a
period of supervision, and will be available for
young offenders who have committed three or
more imprisonable offences and have failed to
respond to punishment in the community.
The first secure training centre will be opened
in April 1998.
Scotland
Criminal proceedings may be brought against
any child aged 8 years or over, but the
instructions of the Lord Advocate are
necessary before anyone under 16 years of age
is prosecuted.
Most children under 16 who have
committed an offence or are considered to be in
need of care and protection may be brought
before a children’s panel. The panel, consisting
of three lay people, determines in an informal
setting whether compulsory measures of care
are required and, if so, the form they should
take. An official known as the reporter decides
whether a child should come before a hearing.
If the grounds for referral are not accepted by
the child or parent, the case goes to the sheriff
for proof. If the sheriff finds the grounds
established, he or she remits the case to the
reporter to arrange a hearing. The sheriff also
decides appeals against a hearing’s decision.
Young people aged between 16 and 21
serve custodial sentences in young offender
institutions. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
Northern Ireland
Those aged between 10 and 16 who are
charged with a criminal offence are normally
brought before a juvenile court. If found
guilty of an offence punishable in the case of
an adult by imprisonment, the court may
order the offender to be placed in care, under
supervision or on probation. The offender
may also be required to attend a day
attendance centre, be sent to a training school
or committed to residence in a remand home.
Non-custodial options are the same as in
England and Wales.
Offenders aged between 16 and 24 who
receive custodial sentences of less than four
years’ detention serve them in a young
offenders’ centre.
Government Proposals on Youth Justice
In response to the problem of youth crime,2
the new Government intends to introduce
legislation to improve the youth justice system
and curb disorder in local communities. A
White Paper is to be published later in 1997.
The proposed legislation will include:
• a fast track system to halve the time it
takes from arrest to sentence for
persistent young offenders, and to
streamline the youth court system;
• a single final warning to replace repeat
cautions;
• new Youth Offender Teams to plan and
supervise intervention programmes
which will follow a final warning, and
new and revised community sentences
aimed at changing young offenders’
behaviour;
• giving courts new sentencing powers,
which will help both offenders and their
parents face up to their responsibilities;
and
• a Youth Justice Board to monitor the
operation of the youth justice system in
England and Wales, to promote good
practice and to draw up standards for
work with young offenders.
2 Almost four in ten offenders found guilty of, or cautioned for, an
indictable offence in England and Wales in 1995 were aged 14 to
20 years old. According to police figures, the peak age for
offending for males in England and Wales was 18 in 1995; almost 9
per cent of 18-year-old males were found guilty of, or cautioned
for, an indictable offence in that year. For females, rates of
offending were lower, and the peak age was younger—at 14.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
The Government has set up a Task Force
on Youth Justice to advise Home Office
ministers on government proposals for the
development of youth justice policies, and
to follow up action agreed by a new
interdepartmental Ministerial Group on
Youth Justice.
Civil Justice
The Civil Law
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
The main subdivisions of civil law are:
• family law, which includes the laws
governing marriage, divorce, and the
welfare of children;
• the law of property (including intellectual
property), which governs ownership and
rights of enjoyment, the creation and
administration of trusts, and the disposal
of property on death;
• the law of contract, which regulates, for
instance, the sale of goods, loans,
partnerships, insurance and guarantees;
and
• the law of torts, which deals with non¬
contractual wrongful acts suffered by one
person at the hands of another.
Civil law also encompasses administrative
law (concerned with the powers of the State),
industrial law (relating to employment),
Admiralty (maritime) law, ecclesiastical law
and service (military) law.
Scotland
In Scotland, civil law comprises public law
and private law. Public law deals with the
regulation and control of political and
administrative power within the State; it
concerns the activities of Parliament, the
courts, central and local government, and
public authorities, and their relationships with
individual citizens. Private law—family law,
the law of contract, law of property, law of
delict (concerning civil wrongs for which the
wrongdoer must pay compensation), and
mercantile law (regulating trade, companies
and bankruptcy)—deals with the rights and
obligations of citizens among themselves.
CIVIL COURTS
England and Wales
Civil cases are heard in county courts and the
High Court. Magistrates’ courts have a
concurrent jurisdiction with the county courts
and the High Court in cases relating to children.
The jurisdiction of the 240 county courts
covers:
• actions founded upon contract and tort;
• trust and mortgage cases;
• actions for the recovery of land;
• cases involving disputes between
landlords and tenants;
• complaints about race and sex
discrimination;
• Admiralty cases (maritime questions and
offences) and patent cases; and
• divorce cases and other family matters.
Specialised work (patent cases, for
example) is concentrated in certain designated
courts. For small claims (up to the value of
£3,000), there are special arbitration facilities
and simplified procedures.
The High Court, which is divided into
three divisions, deals with the more
complicated civil cases. Its jurisdiction covers
mainly civil and some criminal cases; it also
deals with appeals from tribunals (see p. Ill)
and from magistrates’ courts in both civil and
criminal matters. The three divisions are:
• the Family Division, which is concerned
with family law, including adoption and
divorce;
• the Chancery Division, which deals with
corporate and personal insolvency;
disputes in the running of companies,
between landlords and tenants and in
intellectual property matters; and the
interpretation of trusts and contested
wills; and
• the Queen’s Bench Division, which has a
wide and varied jurisdiction, including
contract and tort cases. It also deals with
109
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
applications for judicial review. Maritime
law and commercial law are the
responsibility of the Division’s Admiralty
and commercial courts.
In the event of overlapping jurisdiction
between the High Court and the county
courts, cases of exceptional importance,
complexity or financial substance are reserved
or transferred for trial in the High Court.
Appeals
Appeals in family cases which have been heard
by magistrates’ courts go to the Family
Division of the High Court. Appeals from the
High Court and county courts are heard in the
Court of Appeal (Civil Division), and may go
on to the House of Lords (the final national
court of appeal in civil and criminal cases).
The Law Lords deal with cases submitted to
the House of Lords. They are professional
judges who have been given life peerages (see
chapter 7, p. 58). A group of five judges usually
deals with cases. The Lord Chancellor is
President of the House in its judicial capacity.
Scotland
The civil courts in Scotland are the Court of
Session (the supreme central court, subject only
to the House of Lords) and the sheriff court (the
principal local court), which have the same
jurisdiction over most civil litigation. However,
cases with a value of less than £1,500 are dealt
with only by the sheriff court. Appeals from the
sheriff court may be made to the sheriff
principal or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh, and
in general has jurisdiction to deal with all kinds
of action. It is divided into the Outer House (a
court of first instance) and the Inner House
(mainly an appeal court). Appeals to the Inner
House may be made from the Outer House and
from the sheriff court. From the Inner House
an appeal may go to the House of Lords.
Northern Ireland
Civil cases up to a limited and specified
monetary value are dealt with in county
courts. The magistrates’ courts in Northern
Ireland also deal with certain limited classes of
civil case. The superior civil law court is the
High Court of Justice, from which an appeal
may be made to the Court of Appeal. The
House of Lords is the final civil appeal court.
Appeals from county courts are dealt with by
the High Court or the Court of Appeal.
Civil Proceedings
England and Wales
Actions in the High Court are usually begun
by a writ served by the plaintiff (the aggrieved
party) on the defendant, stating the nature of
the claim. Before the case is tried, documents
(pleadings) setting out the scope of the dispute
are filed with the court; the pleadings are also
served on the parties to the case. County court
proceedings are initiated by a summons,
usually served on the defendant by the court.
Child care cases are initiated by an application
in the magistrates’ courts.
The High Court and the county courts can
order pre-trial exchange of witness statements,
and may impose penalties in costs on parties
who unreasonably refuse to admit facts or to
disclose documents before trial.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter, can
usually be abandoned or ended by settlement
between the parties at any time. Actions
brought to court are usually tried without a
jury, except in defamation, false imprisonment
or malicious prosecution cases or where fraud
is alleged, when either party may apply for
trial by jury. The jury decides questions of
fact and determines the damages to be paid to
the injured party; majority verdicts may be
accepted. The Court of Appeal can increase or
reduce damages awarded by a jury if it
considers them inadequate or excessive.
Most judgments are for sums of money and
may be enforced, in cases of non-payment, by
seizure of the debtor’s goods or by a court
order requiring an employer to make periodic
payments to the court by deduction from the
debtor’s earnings. Other court remedies may
include an injunction restraining someone
from performing an unlawful act. Refusal to
obey a court order may result in a fine or
imprisonment for contempt of court.
110
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Normally the court orders the costs of an
action to be paid by the party losing it.
In civil cases heard by a magistrates’ court,
the court issues a summons to the defendant
setting out details of the complaint and the
date op which it will be heard. Parties and
witnesses give their evidence at the court
hearing. Family proceedings are normally
heard by not more than three lay justices,
including both men and women. Members of
the public are not allowed to be present. The
court may make orders concerning residence,
contact and supervision of children, and in
some cases maintenance payments for spouses
and children.
Proposed Reforms for England and Wales
Following on from the recommendations of a
government-commissioned report into
reducing the cost, delay and complexity of civil
litigation in England and Wales (the Woolf
Report, published in 1996—see p. 114), the
Government announced its plans in October
1997 for reform of the civil justice system.
Adopting the Woolf Report’s proposals for
more hands-on management of cases by
judges, the Government intends to oversee the
creation of two new routes through civil
justice—a fast-track and a multi-track
procedure—to replace the present
complexities. It is proposed that the fast-track
procedure should be accompanied by an
associated fixed-costs regime.
Regarding civil legal fees, a consultation
paper is inviting discussion on the principles
which should underlie a new fee structure.
In the longer term, the Government is
proposing the creation of a Community Legal
Service, the main aim of which would be to
help people decide if their problem is really a
legal one and, if it is not, to guide them to the
appropriate source of advice and information.
Other recommendations of the Woolf Report
are being implemented under the terms of the
Civil Procedure Act, which came into force in
April 1997. The legislation provides for:
• a unified Civil Procedure Rule
Committee, replacing the Supreme
Court and County Court Rule
Committees, with the power to make
rules of court for all civil, non-
matrimonial litigation; and
• the establishment of a Civil Justice
Council, an advisory body to keep the
civil justice system under review and
make proposals for research.
Scotland
Proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary
actions in the sheriff court are initiated by
serving the defender with a summons or, in
sheriff court cases, an initial writ. A defender
who intends to contest the action must inform
the court; if he or she fails to do so, the court
normally grants a decree in absence in favour of
the pursuer. Where a case is contested, both
parties must prepare written pleadings. Time is
allowed for either party to adjust their
pleadings in the light of what the other has said.
At the end of this period a hearing will
normally be arranged.
In cases involving sums between £750 and
£1,500 in the sheriff Court, a statement of claim
is incorporated in the initial writ. The
procedure is designed to enable most actions to
be settled without the parties having to appear
in court. Normally they, or their
representatives, need appear only when an
action is defended.
Tribunals
Tribunals exercise judicial functions separate
from the courts and are intended to be more
accessible, less formal and less expensive.
They are normally set up under statutory
powers, which also govern their constitution,
functions and procedure. Tribunals often
consist of lay people, but they are generally
chaired by a legally qualified person.
Some tribunals settle disputes between
private citizens. Industrial tribunals, for
example, have a major role in employment
disputes. Others, such as those concerned
with social security, resolve claims by private
citizens against public authorities. A further
group, including tax tribunals, decide
disputed claims by public authorities against
private citizens. Tribunals usually consist of
an uneven number of people so that a majority
decision can be reached.
Ill
GOVERNMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
In the case of some tribunals a two-tier
system operates, with an initial right of appeal
to a lower tribunal and a further right of
appeal, usually on a point of law, to a higher
one, and in some cases to the Court of Appeal.
Appeals from single-tier tribunals can usually
be made only on a point of law to the High
Court in England and Wales, to the Court of
Session in Scotland, and to the Court of
Appeal in Northern Ireland.
The independent Council on Tribunals
exercises general supervision over many
tribunals. A Scottish Committee of the Council
exercises the same function in Scotland.
Legal Aid
A person who needs legal advice, assistance or
representation may be able to get help with
legal costs from the legal aid scheme. People
who qualify for help may have all their legal
costs paid for, or may be asked to make a
contribution towards them, depending on
their means and, in civil cases, the outcome of
the case.
Legal Advice and Assistance
Legal advice is available under the Legal
Advice and Assistance (‘Green Form’)
Scheme in England and Wales. People whose
income and capital are within certain limits are
entitled to free advice from a solicitor on most
legal matters. The scheme provides initially
for up to three hours’ work for matrimonial
cases where a petition is drafted, and two
hours for other work. Similar schemes operate
in Northern Ireland and Scotland.
Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
At present civil legal aid may be available for
most civil proceedings to those who satisfy the
financial eligibility conditions and have
reasonable grounds for taking, defending or
being a party to proceedings. It may be
refused if it is considered unreasonable that an
applicant should receive it in the particular
circumstances. Legal aid is available on a non¬
means, non-merits tested or means-tested-
only basis to certain categories of applicant in
certain specified proceedings regarding
children. In England and Wales payments to
lawyers are made through the Legal Aid
Fund, administered by the Legal Aid Board.
Scotland has a separate Legal Aid Fund,
administered by the Scottish Legal Aid Board.
In Northern Ireland legal aid is administered
by the Law Society for Northern Ireland.
An assisted person has some protection
against orders for costs being made against
him or her, and in certain limited
circumstances the successful unassisted
opponent of a legally aided party may recover
his or her costs from the Legal Aid Board.
Where the assisted person recovers or
preserves money or property in the
proceedings, the Legal Aid Fund will usually
have a first charge on that money or property
to recover money spent on the assisted
person’s behalf (the ‘statutory charge’).
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
In criminal proceedings in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland legal aid may be granted
by the court if it appears to be in the interests
of justice and if a defendant is considered to
require financial assistance. A contribution
towards the costs may be payable.
The Legal Aid Board makes arrangements
for duty solicitors to assist unrepresented
defendants in the magistrates’ courts.
Solicitors are also available, on a 24-hour
basis, to give advice and assistance to those
being questioned by the police. The services
of a solicitor at a police station and of the duty
solicitor at court are not means-tested and are
free.
Where legal aid is granted for criminal
cases in Northern Ireland it is free. There is a
voluntary duty solicitor scheme at the main
magistrates’ court in Belfast.
Scotland
A duty solicitor is available to represent peopl'
in custody on their first appearance in the
sheriff courts and the district courts without
enquiry into the person’s means. In other
cases, a person seeking legal aid in summary
criminal proceedings must apply to the
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Scottish Legal Aid Board, which must be
satisfied that the costs of the case cannot be
met by the applicant without undue hardship,
and that it is in the interests of justice that
legal aid is awarded.
In solemn proceedings the court decides on
the availability of legal aid and must be satisfied
that the accused cannot meet the costs of the
defence without undue financial hardship.
Where legal aid is granted to the accused in
criminal proceedings, he or she is not required
to pay any contribution towards expenses.
Administrative Reform
England and Wales
In October 1997, in the light of rapidly
increasing legal aid expenditure (up from
£682 million in 1990-91 to £1,477 million six
years later), the Government announced plans
for reform of the legal aid system in England
and Wales. The changes include contracting
for legal services, in both criminal and civil
cases, with contracts specifying in advance
what services are being bought, and at exactly
what prices. The aim is to ensure that
resources are targeted at those who need them,
to stop cases going on too long, to trim costs
and to cut waste and duplication. It is also
intended that, in determining which cases
should be assisted from the legal aid fund, the
merits test should stipulate a 75 per cent
likelihood of success.
The Government is also consulting on the
maximum possible extension of conditional fee
agreements (where the risk of bringing a case
is shared between litigants and their lawyers)
to all civil proceedings, other than family
cases, from April 1998.
Subject to consultations, the reforms are
expected to exclude most claims for money or
damages from legal aid, so that taking forward
a civil case will depend on whether or not it
has the merit to persuade a lawyer to handle it
on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis.
Scotland
In July 1997 the new Government announced
the implementation of the criminal legal
assistance provisions in the Crime and
Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997. From
October 1997:
• the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB)
assumes increased enforcement powers;
and
• the Secretary of State may prescribe
fixed payments to solicitors for providing
criminal legal assistance.
From October 1998:
• all solicitors providing legal aid must
register with the SLAB and conform to
the Board’s code of practice; and
• a pilot scheme for a public solicitor
employed by the SLAB will be
introduced to test alternative ways of
providing publicly funded legal
representation;
The 1997 Act does not apply to civil legal
aid.
Free Representation Units
The Bar Council, the barristers’ professional
body, supports a Free Representation Unit for
clients at a variety of tribunals for which legal
aid is not available. Most of the representation
by the London unit is carried out by Bar
students supported and advised by full-time
case workers. Elsewhere, barristers do such
work through regional units. A special Bar
unit, based in London, was formed in 1996
through which more senior barristers provide
representation in cases which might otherwise
not be heard.
Law Centres
In some urban areas law centres provide free
legal advice and representation. They may
employ a salaried lawyer and many have
community workers. Much of their time is
devoted to housing, employment, social
security and immigration problems. Although
there is a restriction on cases they will accept,
most law centres will give preliminary advice.
Advice at minimal or no cost may be
available in Citizens Advice Bureaux, consumer
and housing advice centres and in specialist
advice centres run by voluntary organisations.

In addition to furthering its national interests, Britain wants to contribute to a
strong world community, promoting security, prosperity, quality of life and
mutual respect. The main aims of the new Government’s foreign policy are to:
• make Britain a leading player in a Europe of independent nation states;
• strengthen the Commonwealth;
• secure more effective international action to preserve world peace and
combat world poverty;
• increase respect and goodwill for Britain among the peoples of the world by
drawing on the assets of the British Council and the BBC World Service;
and
• strengthen Britain’s relationships in all regions of the world.
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN
POLICY
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO)
is in charge of overall foreign policy and is
headed by the Foreign Secretary, who is
assisted by four ministers without Cabinet
rank. The FCO’s Permanent Under-Secretary
of State is a civil servant who heads the
Diplomatic Service and provides advice to the
Foreign Secretary.
Britain maintains a worldwide presence
through 222 diplomatic missions and has
diplomatic or consular relations with 189
countries.
Of the 5,800 FCO staff, some 2,400 serve
overseas, of whom 121 are seconded from
other government departments and other
public and private organisations. British
diplomatic missions also employ some 7,600
locally engaged staff. Staff overseas deal with
political, commercial and economic work;
entry clearance to Britain and consular work;
aid administration; and information and other
activities, such as culture, science and
technology.
The FCO’s only executive agency, Wilton
Park International Conference Centre (at
Wiston House in West Sussex), contributes to
the solution of international problems by
organising conferences in Britain, attended by
115
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
politicians, business people, academics and
other professionals from all over the world.
Other Departments
Several other government departments are
closely involved with foreign policy issues.
The newly created Department for
International Development administers
Britain’s bilateral aid programme (see p. 136).
The Ministry of Defence maintains military
liaison with Britain’s NATO and other allies,
in addition to controlling and administering
the armed forces (see p. 149). The
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has
an important influence on international trade
policy and commercial relations with other
countries, including European Union (EU)
member states. The ECO and DTI work hand
in hand on export and inward investment
promotion and have recently established a
joint forum to consider how to improve
British export promotion initiatives. HM
Treasury is involved in British international
economic policy and is responsible for
Britain’s relations with the World Bank and
other international financial institutions.
When other departments are involved, the
ECO decides policy in consultation with them.
The ECO co-ordinates British EU policy
through the Cabinet Office European
Secretariat.
The British Council is responsible for
Britain’s cultural relations with other
countries (see p. 140).
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
Britain belongs to about 80 international
organisations. Membership of the following
bodies is of particular importance.
United Nations
Britain is a founder member of the United
Nations (UN) and one of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, along with
China, France, Russia and the United States.
In 1996 it was the fifth largest contributor to
the UN regular budget. It is also a significant
contributor to UN peacekeeping operations
(see p. 128). Britain is fully committed to the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter,
including the maintenance of international
peace and security, the development of
friendly relations among nations, the
achievement of international co-operation on
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian
issues and the protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
European Union
Britain is a member of the European Union
(EU), which comprises the European
Community (EC) and intergovernmental co¬
operation on foreign and security policy, and
on justice and home affairs. The EU has 15
democratic nations as members; they are
Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, the Irish Republic,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain and Sweden. As one of the
five most populous countries, Britain provides
two of the 20 members of the European
Commission, which puts forward legislative
proposals, executes the decisions taken by the
Council of the European Union and ensures
that EC rules are correctly observed. Britain is
represented at every meeting of the Council,
which is the main decision-making body. Each
Council consists of government ministers
from the 15 member states, representing
national interests in the subjects under
discussion, for example, trade, agriculture or
transport. When a member state has the
Presidency of the Union (for a period of six
months), its ministers are responsible for
chairing meetings of the Council. Britain
assumes the Presidency in January 1998. The
Committee of Permanent Representatives,
consisting of member states’ ambassadors to
the EU, prepares the work of the Council.
European Community policies are
implemented by various forms of Community
legislation.
The European Council, which meets at
least twice a year, comprises the heads of state
or government and their foreign ministers and
the President of the Commission, usually
accompanied by a fellow Commissioner.
There are 626 members of the directly
elected European Parliament, which is

consulted about major decisions and has
substantial shared power with the Council of
the European Union over the EC budget.
Britain has 87 seats. Elections to the
Parliament take place every five years, the
most recent having been held in June 1994.
For the next elections in 1999, the British
Government has proposed the adoption of a
new electoral system based on proportional
representation to bring it in line with the other
member states.
Each member state provides one of the
judges to serve in the European Court of
Justice, which is the supreme authority in the
field of Community law. Its rulings must be
applied by member states, and sanctions can
be imposed on those failing to do so. The
Court is assisted by a Court of First Instance,
which handles certain cases brought by
individuals and companies. Britain is also
represented on the Court of Auditors, which
examines Community revenue and
expenditure to see that it is legally received
and spent.
The Community enters into trade
agreements with third countries and has a
number of substantial aid programmes. Under
the common foreign and security policy,
member states issue common statements and
declarations and agree legally binding
common positions and joint actions on foreign
policy issues. Member states also co-operate
on justice and home affairs issues such as
asylum, immigration and the fight against
crime.
The Commonwealth
There are 54 members of the Commonwealth,
including Britain. It is a voluntary association
of states, nearly all of which were British
territories but are now independent. The
members are Antigua and Barbuda,
Australia, the Bahamas, Bangladesh,
Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Britain, Brunei
Darussalam, Cameroon, Canada, Cyprus,
Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana,
Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya,
Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia,
Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand, Nigeria
(suspended), Pakistan, Papua New Guinea,
St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and
the Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles, Sierra
Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South
Africa, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu,
Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Nauru and Tuvalu are special members,
entitled to take part in all Commonwealth
meetings and activities, with the exception of
the biennial Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meetings. South Africa rejoined
in 1994 after an absence of 33 years. Nigeria
was suspended at the 1995 heads of
government meeting because of political
repression and human rights abuses. Sierra
Leone has been suspended from the councils
of the Commonwealth because its military
junta has not been recognised as a legitimate
government.
Consultation between member states takes
place through:
• Heads of Government Meetings;
• specialised conferences of other ministers
and officials;
• diplomatic representatives known as high
commissioners; and
• non-governmental organisations.
The Queen is recognised as head of the
Commonwealth and is head of state in Britain
and 15 other member countries. In 1997
Britain hosted the Heads of Government
Meeting for the first time in 20 years; the
Meeting took place in Edinburgh and its main
theme was trade, investment and
development.
The Commonwealth Secretariat in London
promotes consultation, disseminates
information, and helps the host government to
organise Heads of Government Meetings,
ministerial meetings and other conferences.
It administers co-operative programmes
agreed at these meetings, including the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co¬
operation, which provides consultancy
services and training awards to
Commonwealth developing countries.
Membership of the Commonwealth enables
Britain to play a responsible part alongside
other nations in aiding the democratisation
and progress of the developing world.

North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO)
Membership of NATO is central to British
defence policy (see p. 143). Its core functions
are to:
• provide a foundation of security in the
North Atlantic area, linking European
security with that of North America;
• deter aggression and defend member
states against it; and
• act as the primary forum for consultation
among Allies on security and defence
issues.
Each of the 16 member states (Belgium,
Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey and the United States) has a
permanent representative at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. The main decision¬
taking body is the North Atlantic Council. It
meets at least twice a year at foreign minister
level, and weekly at the level of permanent
representatives. Defence ministers also meet
at least twice a year.
Western European Union
Britain is a member of the Western European
Union (WEU), which is the main forum for co¬
operation and consultation on defence issues
for NATO’s European members. The WEU’s
other full members are Belgium, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Iceland,
Norway and Turkey are associate members;
Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Irish Republic
and Sweden are observers. ‘Associate
partnership’ has been extended to ten Central
European and Baltic states.
The Group of Seven/Eight
Britain is part of the Group of Seven (G7)
leading industrialised countries. The other
members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan and the United States. The G7 is an
informal group with no secretariat. Its
Presidency rotates each year among the
members, the key meeting being an annual
summit of heads of government. Originally
formed in 1975 to discuss economic issues, the
G7 agenda now includes a wide range of issues
such as international crime, terrorism, nuclear
safety, the environment, UN reform and
development assistance.
Russia has participated in these political
discussions since 1994 (thereby constituting
the G8). In 1998 Britain will host the G7/8
summit in Birmingham.
Organisation for Security and Co¬
operation in Europe (OSCE)
Britain is a signatory to the 1975 Helsinki
Final Act, which established a framework for
co-operation between states participating in
the Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe (CSCE), respect for human rights
and economic matters. Britain also signed the
1990 Paris Charter, committing its signatories
to democracy, human rights and market
economies. In 1994 the CSCE was retitled the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in
Europe, reflecting its transition from a
conference to a more formalised institution. It
has a Secretariat in Vienna, where Britain has
a permanent delegation. Day-to-day business
is conducted in the Permanent Council. A
Prague office organises occasional meetings of
senior officials.
The OSCE has 54 participating states,
including every country in Europe, the states
of the former Soviet Union, and the United
States and Canada. The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia was suspended in 1992. All states
participate on an equal basis, and decisions are
taken by consensus.
The main areas of OSCE work are:
• early warning of potential conflict
through preventive diplomacy missions
and the work of the OSCE High
Commissioner on National Minorities;
• observing elections and providing advice
on human rights, democracy and law
through the OSCE Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights in
Warsaw (see p. 135); and
• promoting security through arms control
and military confidence-building.
120
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
The OSCE has been given responsibility
under the Dayton Peace Agreement for
preparation of elections, monitoring human
rights and arms control in Bosnia and
Herzegovina (see p. 128).
Council of Europe
Britain is a founding member of the Council
of Europe, which is open to any European
state accepting parliamentary democracy and
the protection of fundamental human rights
and freedoms. The 40 member states co¬
operate on culture, education, sport, health,
anti-crime policy, measures against drug
trafficking, youth affairs and the improvement
of the environment. The Council adopted its
European Convention on Human Rights in
1950 (see p. 134).
Other International Bodies
Britain belongs to many other international
bodies, and was a founder member of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank. The IMF regulates the
international financial system and provides
credit for member countries facing balance-of-
payments difficulties. The World Bank
provides loans to finance economic and social
projects in developing countries.
In addition, Britain, along with 27 other
industrialised countries, is part of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), which promotes
economic growth, support for less developed
countries and worldwide trade expansion.
Other organisations to which Britain
belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia, and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
BRITAIN’S DEPENDENT
TERRITORIES
Britain’s Dependent Territories have a
combined population of some 200,000. Most
territories have considerable self-government,
with their own legislatures. Governors
appointed by the Queen are responsible for
external affairs, internal security (including
the police) and the public service. Certain
responsibilities are delegated to locally elected
representatives, but the ultimate responsibility
for all government affairs rests with the
Foreign Secretary. The British Indian Ocean
Territory, the British Antarctic Territory, and
South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands have commissioners, not governors.
Britain seeks to provide the territories with
security and political stability, ensure efficient
and honest government, and help them
achieve economic and social development on a
par with neighbouring countries.
The territories are: Anguilla; Bermuda
(where, in a referendum in 1995, voters
rejected decisively the principle of
independence from Britain); British Antarctic
Territory; British Indian Ocean Territory;
British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands;
Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Montserrat;
Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and Oeno; St
Helena and St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension and Tristan da Cunha); South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; and
Turks and Caicos Islands.
British policy is to help the inhabitants of
the Dependent Territories to take
independence if they want it and where it is
practicable, and to do so in accordance with
treaty obligations. The reasonable needs of the
Dependent Territories are a first call on the
British aid programme.
The Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina, but the
inhabitants wish to remain under British
sovereignty. The British Government does
not accept the Argentine claim and is
committed to defending the Islanders’ right to
live under a government of their own choice.
This right of self-determination is set out in
the 1985 Falkland Islands Constitution.
In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied
the Islands, but its forces were expelled by
British troops following Argentina’s failure to
abide by UN resolutions requesting its forces
to withdraw. Britain and Argentina, while
sticking to their respective positions on
121
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
sovereignty, maintain diplomatic relations and
continue to discuss their common interests in
the South Atlantic region, such as fisheries
conservation and the exploitation of oil
reserves. A Joint Declaration on co-operation
over offshore activities was signed in 1995,
enabling the Falkland Islands to launch an oil
licensing round.
Gibraltar
Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in perpetuity
by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Spain has long
sought the return of Gibraltar. However,
Britain is firmly committed to the principle,
set out in the preamble to the 1969 Gibraltar
Constitution, that it will never enter into
arrangements under which the people of
Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of
another state against their freely and
democratically expressed wishes.
Gibraltar has an elected House of Assembly
and, under the 1969 Constitution,
responsibility for a wide range of ‘defined
domestic matters’ is devolved to the elected
local ministers.
Gibraltar is within the European Union, as
part of the United Kingdom member state,
although it is outside the common customs
system and does not participate in the
Common Agricultural or Fisheries Policies or
the EU’s value added tax arrangements. The
people of Gibraltar have been declared United
Kingdom nationals for EU purposes.
Caribbean Dependent Territories
The Dependent Territories Regional
Secretariat in Barbados administers aspects
of British government policy towards the
Caribbean territories (Anguilla, the British
Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands,
Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos
Islands). Jointly agreed country policy
plans for each territory receiving British
aid have been introduced or are under
discussion.
In London an FCO minister chairs the
Ministerial Group for the Caribbean
Dependent Territories, which is drawn from a
number of government departments and
agencies. It meets two or three times a year.
Policy initiatives by the Group are supported
by the Good Government Fund which, among
other objectives, pays for British personnel on
loan to local governments to help them fight
drug trafficking and other criminal activity.
Assistance is also given to local disaster
response teams. In addition, the Group
monitors a programme of action designed to
improve regulation of the offshore finance
sector and anti-money-laundering measures.

EUROPEAN UNION POLICY
The new British Government is pledged to
play a constructive part in the European
Union. Its priorities are the completion of the
single market in financial services, EU
enlargement to include Cyprus and the
democratic nations in Central and Eastern
Europe, reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy and a more effective Common Foreign
and Security Policy. It also believes that
substantial progress can be made by member
states through a common approach to
transport and environment issues. In
particular, the Government wants the EU to
become much more relevant to its inhabitants,
for example, by taking effective action to cut
high rates of unemployment. In the national
interest Britain will retain its veto on issues
such as frontier controls, taxation, social
security, defence decisions, the EU budget
and changes in the EU treaties.
Background
The Union had its origins in the post-Second
World War resolve by Western European
nations, particularly France and Germany, to
prevent wars breaking out again between
themselves. The 1957 Rome Treaty, which
established the European Community, defined
its aims as the harmonious development of
economic activities, a continuous and balanced
economic expansion and an accelerated rise in
the standard of living. These objectives were
to be achieved by the creation of a common
internal market, including the elimination of
customs duties between member states, free
movement of goods, people, services and
capital, and the elimination of distortions in
competition within this market. These
objectives were reaffirmed by the 1986 Single
European Act, which agreed measures to
complete the internal market (see p. 125).
Maastricht Treaty
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty amended the
Rome Treaty and made other new
commitments, including moves towards
economic and monetary union. It established
the EU, which comprises the European
Community, intergovernmental arrangements
for a common foreign and security policy (see
p. 127) and increased co-operation on
interior/justice policy issues. The Maastricht
Treaty also codified the principle of subsidiarity,
under which action should be taken at European
level only if its objectives cannot be achieved by
member states acting alone and can be better
achieved by the Community. Under an
agreement reached in 1992, a subsidiarity test is
applied to all European Commission proposals
for action. In addition, the Treaty introduced
the concept of European Union citizenship as a
supplement to national citizenship.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Maastricht Treaty provided for progress
towards economic and monetary union
(EMU) in three stages: the first, completion of
124
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
the single market, was largely achieved at the
end of 1993. The second stage, which began
on 1 January 1994, includes the establishment
of a European Monetary Institute with a
largely advisory and consultative role.
Although the Institute is preparing for stage 3,
monetary policy remains a national
responsibility. Member states co-ordinate
economic policies in the context of agreed
non-binding policy guidelines. The British
Government is participating in stage 2.
The third stage is a single currency for EU
member states. Under the Treaty this is
envisaged by 1 January 1999, although member
states will have to satisfy certain convergence
criteria on inflation rates, government deficit
levels, currency fluctuation margins and
interest rates.
The Government believes that British
membership of the single currency would, in
principle, benefit both Britain and Europe,
provided that there were clear advantages for
business and industry. It has stated, however,
that it would not be in Britain’s economic
interests to join the single currency in 1999,
and that a decision to do so during the current
Parliament is not realistic, since sustainable
economic convergence with other member
states will not be achieved by 2002.
Nevertheless, the Government has pledged
that it will make intensive preparations during
the current Parliament, so that Britain is in a
position to join the single currency after 2002,
if such a decision is approved by Parliament
and by the British people in a referendum.
Amsterdam Treaty
Following on from the Maastricht Treaty, an
intergovernmental conference (IGC) was
convened by EU heads of government in
March 1996 to consider further treaty
amendments. The result of these negotiations
was the draft treaty agreed in Amsterdam in
May 1997 and signed by member states in
October. Among the main points are:
• the outlawing of discrimination on the
basis of gender, race, religion, sexual
orientation and age;
• more co-ordination by member states of
measures designed to cut unemployment;
• the reintegration of the social chapter (see
p. 127) in the Treaty, following Britain’s
decision to sign and support the chapter;
• new mechanisms to improve the co¬
ordination and effectiveness of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP—see p. 127);
• arrangements for improved co-operation
between the EU and Western European
Union on the defence aspects of the CFSP;
• simplification of the European
Parliament’s procedures by increasing its
powers of co-decision with the Council of
Ministers; and
• a binding protocol on subsidiarity.
During the Amsterdam discussions, Britain
succeeded in obtaining legal security for its
border controls, thereby ensuring that policies
on immigration, asylum and visas are made in
Britain and not Brussels.
Treaty Ratification
Any amendments to the Treaties can only be
agreed unanimously and must then be ratified
by each member state according to its own
constitutional procedures. In Britain Treaty
ratifications have to be approved by
Parliament before they can enter into force.
The Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of:
• levies on agricultural imports;
• customs duties;
• the proceeds of a notional rate of value
added tax of up to 1.4 per cent on a
standard ‘basket’ of goods and services; and
• contributions from member states based
on gross national product (GNP).
Britain has an annual rebate worth some
£2,000 million because, without it, the British
net contribution would be far greater than that
justified by its share of Community GNP.
Single Market
The single market, providing for the free
movement of people, goods, services and
125
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
capital, is largely complete in legislative terms.
It covers, among other benefits, the removal of
customs barriers, the liberalisation of capital
movements, the opening of public
procurement markets and the mutual
recognition of professional qualifications. It is
not fully operative, especially in the area of
financial services, where Britain is seeking to
make progress.
Under the European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement, which entered into force in
January 1994, most of the EU single market
measures have been extended to Iceland,
Norway and Liechtenstein.
Transport, Energy and Telecommunications
The concept of a common transport policy was
laid down in the Treaty of Rome. Liberalisation
measures relating to civil aviation, shipping, and
road haulage and passenger services are
described in chapter 19.
The EU is working towards the completion
of trans-European networks in the fields of
transport, energy and telecommunications. The
aim is to improve the interconnection and
interoperability of national networks. One of the
main transport projects endorsed by the
European Council is the planned construction
of a new rail link between London and the
Channel Tunnel (see p. 313).
Trade
Britain is the world’s fifth largest trading nation.
EEA member states comprise the world’s
largest trading bloc, accounting for about 40 per
cent of all trade. The British Government
favours an open world trading system, on which
EU member states depend for future economic
growth and jobs.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of Britain and the
other member states in international trade
negotiations. The Commission negotiates on a
mandate agreed by the Council. For further
information on trade, see chapter 12.
The Environment
EU member states are at the forefront of many
international measures on environmental
issues, such as air quality standards and the
depletion of the ozone layer. For further
information, see chapter 21.
Agriculture and Fisheries
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It has also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing a burden on the Community’s budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is concerned
with the conservation and management of
fishery resources. The operation of these
policies, and Britain’s advocacy of CAP
reform, are described in chapter 18.
Regional and Infrastructure
Development
There are a number of Structural Funds
designed to:
• promote economic development in
underdeveloped regions;
• regenerate regions affected by industrial
decline;
• combat long-term unemployment and
facilitate the entry of young people into
the labour market;
• help workers adapt to industrial changes
and to advances in production systems;
• speed up the adjustment of production,
processing and marketing structures in
agriculture; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and industrial
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the unemployed
and young people. The Guidance Section of
the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund supports agricultural
restructuring and some rural development
measures. The Financial Instrument of
Fisheries Guidance helps to modernise the
fishing industry. A Cohesion Fund, set up
under the Maastricht Treaty, is designed to
reduce disparities between levels of
126
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
development in the poorer and richer member
states.
Other initiatives assist the development of
new economic activities in regions affected by
the restructuring of traditional industries,
such as steel, coal and shipbuilding.
The European Investment Bank, a non-
profit-making institution, lends at competitive
interest rates to public and private capital
investment projects.
Employment and Social Affairs
In May 1997 the Government announced that
it would end Britain’s opt-out from the
Maastricht Treaty’s social chapter (extending
Community social policy and qualified
majority voting into new areas of social
affairs). Two measures so far adopted under
the chapter deal with European works councils
and parental leave, both of which are designed
to promote good working conditions. By
ending the opt-out, the Government wants to
play a full part in negotiations on such social
matters by ensuring that the chapter promotes
labour flexibility and employability.
Under the Amsterdam Treaty it has been
agreed that the European Investment Bank
should be more closely involved in measures
to cut unemployment.
Research and Development
Research collaboration among member states
is promoted primarily through a series of
framework programmes defining priorities
and setting out the overall level of funding.
The Government actively encourages British
companies and organisations to participate in
collaborative research and development
(R & D) with European partners (see p. 326).
The Fourth Framework Programme,
adopted in April 1994, focuses on generic and
precompetitive research which is of use to a
number of industries. It covers information
and communications technologies, industrial
technologies, the environment, life sciences
and technology, energy, transport and socio¬
economic research. The programme also
provides for international co-operation,
dissemination of research, and training and
mobility of researchers.
Negotiations are currently taking place on
the Fifth Framework Programme which is
likely to be adopted during the latter part of
1998.
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The common foreign and security policy
(CFSP), established by the Maastricht Treaty,
is intergovernmental, decisions being taken
unanimously. Common policies have been
agreed on issues such as the delivery of
humanitarian aid to Bosnia, assistance to the
Middle East peace process (including the
appointment of an EU special envoy), efforts
to restore stability to the Great Lakes region
of Africa and measures to encourage transition
to democracy and respect for human rights in
Burma, Cuba, Nigeria and Zaire. Efforts have
also been made to combat the indiscriminate
use of anti-personnel landmines.
In Britain’s view, one of the main
weaknesses of the CFSP has been the practical
implementation of policy initiatives. During
the negotiations on the Amsterdam Treaty,
Britain successfully pressed for new
mechanisms to make the policy more effective.
The Amsterdam Treaty will introduce several
key changes, including:
• the appointment, unanimously by the
Council, of a High Representative to
assist with the formulation, preparation
and presentation of CFSP policy
decisions; and
• the establishment of a policy planning
and early warning unit in the Council
Secretariat to sharpen the preparation
and focus of common foreign policy
decisions.
Furthermore, decisions implementing
common strategies will be by qualified
majority voting in the Council, although a
member state will be able to prevent a vote
being taken for ‘important and stated reasons
of national policy’. If this occurs, the matter
may be referred to the European Council for
decision by unanimity. Provision for
‘constructive abstention’ allows a member
state to abstain and stand aside from an EU
decision/action when its interests are not
engaged; this does not affect the right to veto.
127
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
The EU continues to look to the Western
European Union to handle defence issues
under the CFSP. The Amsterdam Treaty
provides for the ‘progressive framing of a
common defence policy’, in which the
Western European Union would support the
EU. The WEU also provides the EU with
access to an operational military capacity. The
Treaty recognises that NATO provides
common defence for Britain and its allies.
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND
SECURITY
The United Nations is the principal body
responsible for the maintenance of international
peace and security. Britain is active in looking
for ways of strengthening the capacity of the
UN and other international organisations to
predict and prevent conflicts before they arise.
Britain and UN Peacekeeping
Several British officers are currently serving in
the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping
Operations and are performing operational,
financial and other specialist functions. Britain
pays an assessed share of the costs of UN
peacekeeping (nearly 7 per cent of the total),
contributing about £54 million in 1996.
Cyprus
Britain has a contingent of more than 400
troops in the UN Force in Cyprus, which was
established in 1964 to help prevent the
recurrence of fighting on the island between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Since the serious
hostilities of 1974, when Turkish forces
occupied the northern part of the island, the
Force has been responsible for monitoring the
ceasefire and control of a buffer zone between
the two communities. Both Britain and the
United States have appointed special
representatives to Cyprus to support a UN-led
effort to promote a settlement between Greek
and Turkish Cypriots.
Iraq/ Kuwait
In 1991 Security Council Resolution 687
established a demilitarised zone extending 10
km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait to deter
violations of the boundary and to observe
hostile or potentially hostile actions. Britain,
with the other permanent members of the
Security Council, contributes 11 personnel to
the UN Iraq/Kuwait observer mission
(UNIKOM).
Georgia
Britain contributes eight military personnel to
the UN Observer Mission in Georgia, which
was established in 1993. Its mandate includes
monitoring a ceasefire between Georgian
government troops and rebels in the Georgian
region of Abkhazia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Britain supports the establishment of a
peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and is playing a central role
in the implementation of the Dayton Peace
Agreement, which was signed in Paris in
December 1995. Some 5,000 British troops are
participating in the NATO-led Stabilisation
Force (SFOR), which comprises around
30,000 troops from NATO nations and other
contributing countries, including Russia and a
number of other Partnership for Peace
members (see p. 129).
The main task of the force is to ensure
continuing compliance with the military
aspects of the Dayton Agreement, which
includes monitoring the ceasefire, separating
rival armed forces and inspecting weapon
sites. As a secondary task, SFOR provides
selective support to the main organisations
responsible for the civil aspects of the
Agreement (for example, holding elections),
including the Office of the High
Representative, the UN International Police
Task Force, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, and the OSCE. Although the
military requirements of the Dayton
Agreement have largely been met, many of the
civil aspects are yet to be fully implemented.
Britain attaches high priority to assisting
the international criminal tribunal in The
Hague, which was set up to try those indicted
for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
responsible for arresting indictees and handing
them over to the tribunal, in most cases they
have failed to do so. In addition to supporting
the tribunal through the provision of staff,
information and forensic science expertise,
Britain has provided funds to establish a
second courtroom in The Hague.
CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
AND CENTRAL ASIA
Since the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact
and the formation of democratically elected
governments in Central and Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, the European security
situation has been transformed. In 1990
NATO Allies and former Warsaw Pact states
formed the North Atlantic Co-operation
Council to foster understanding. In May 1997
the Council’s foreign ministers agreed to
establish a new form of political consultation
called the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.
In 1994 a NATO summit meeting invited
the non-NATO states in Central and Eastern
Europe and Central Asia to join a Partnership
for Peace in order to:
• develop a practical working relationship;
and
• enlist the Partners’ assistance in
peacekeeping operations and guide their
armed forces towards compatibility with
those of NATO countries.
The Partnership for Peace, which now
includes 27 countries, has grown rapidly into a
formidable and varied programme of military
and political co-operation. In May 1997
NATO foreign ministers agreed to increase
the scope of Partnership activities. Partners
will remain free to determine their own level
of co-operation with NATO, and will have the
opportunity to plan and train with NATO for
the most demanding military operations.
In July 1997 a NATO summit invited the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to
negotiate accession to NATO. The summit
expressed the hope that they would be
members by 1999 and pledged the Alliance’s
continuing openness to further new members.
In May 1997 a Founding Act was signed in
Paris between NATO member states and
Russia, the aim of which is to establish a
strong and lasting partnership. One of the
main provisions is the creation of a Permanent
Joint Council which would give neither side a
veto over the other’s activities but will enable
Russia to be associated with, and involved in,
the main decisions on European security; it
will also provide a framework for greater
security and defence co-operation.
NATO and Ukraine signed a Charter for a
Distinctive Partnership in May 1997
providing for expanded co-operation and
consultation.
Economic Help
Britain and other Western countries are taking
action to help deal with the vast economic
problems following the fall of Communism, and
to promote the development of market
economies. The IMF and World Bank, with
Britain’s active support, provide advice and
finance to nearly all countries in the region,
while the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development channels Western investment.
The European Community’s PHARE scheme is
assisting Central European countries in the
process of reform and the development of
infrastructure. Countries of the former Soviet
Union and Mongolia receive help through a
parallel programme (TACIS), which
concentrates on financial services, transport,
energy (including nuclear safety) and
humanitarian needs. Britain’s Export Credit
Guarantee Department provides insurance cover
for exporters to a number of these countries.
Know How Fund
The Know How Fund is Britain’s programme
of bilateral technical assistance to the countries
of Central and Eastern Europe and Central
Asia. It aims to support their transition to
pluralist democracy and a market economy by
providing British skills and by encouraging
British investment in the region. Britain spends
about £85 million a year on the programme.
Europe (Association) Agreements
The European Union has strengthened
relations with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
129
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia by signing
Europe (Association) Agreements with them.
The agreements envisage accession to the
European Union when these countries are able
to assume the obligations of membership.
The EU has signed partnership and co¬
operation agreements with Russia, Ukraine,
Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus,
Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and
Uzbekistan. A Trade and Co-operation
Agreement is in force with Albania. The
purpose of all these agreements is to reduce
trade barriers, develop wide-ranging co¬
operation and increase political dialogue at all
levels.
OTHER REGIONS
The Middle East
Middle East Peace Process
Britain supported the breakthrough in the
Middle East peace process in 1993, when
Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO) agreed to mutual
recognition and signed a Declaration of
Principles on interim self-government for the
Palestinians in Israeli-held territories occupied
in 1967. The first stage of the Declaration was
implemented in May 1994, when the
Palestinians adopted self-government in the
Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. In October
1994 a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan
was formally signed. Britain continues to
encourage peace negotiations between Israel,
Syria and Lebanon.
A further advance was achieved in
September 1995, when Israel and the PLO
reached an Interim Agreement providing for a
phased Israeli troop withdrawal from occupied
Palestinian areas of the West Bank and for
elections to a new Palestinian Council with
legislative and executive powers. Britain took
part in the EU-co-ordinated international
observation of the Palestinian elections in
January 1996.
Progress has been less smooth in recent
months, in part because of delays in
implementing the Interim Agreement, the
continued expansion of Israeli settlements in
the occupied territories and terrorist bomb
attacks in Israel and Jerusalem. EU member
states continue to support the peace process
and have appealed to all parties in the region
to avoid and prevent actions which might
destroy prospects for a lasting peace and
prejudice further negotiations. The British
Government has proposed that it and the
other EU states should become leading
partners in attempts to reactivate the process
so as to ensure security for the Israelis and
take full account of the wishes and aspirations
of the Palestinian people.
Britain has given £87 million over three
years in aid to the Palestinians and the peace
process through bilateral and multilateral
channels. Programmes support Palestinian
administration, police training, the Palestinian
Monetary Authority, legal structures and the
judiciary, water management and healthcare.
The Gulf Conflict
As a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, Britain strongly condemned Iraq’s
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and
supported all the Council’s resolutions
designed to force Iraqi withdrawal and restore
international legality. Because of Iraq’s failure
to withdraw, its forces were expelled in
February 1991 by an international coalition
led by the United States, Britain, France and
Saudi Arabia, acting under a UN mandate.
UN Security Council Resolution 661
imposed sanctions on Iraq on 6 August 1990.
Resolution 687, adopted on 3 April 1991,
formalised the ceasefire in the Gulf War and
stipulated conditions for Iraqi acceptance,
including measures to prevent the
development of weapons of mass destruction,
recognition of the border with Kuwait and the
payment of compensation to those who
suffered as a result of the invasion of Kuwait.
The resolution, supported by Britain,
modified sanctions on Iraq; these remain in
force until the Security Council is satisfied
that Iraq is fully in compliance with all
relevant Security Council resolutions.
As part of the agreement ending hostilities,
the Security Council authorised the creation
of a Special Commission (UNSCOM) to
supervise the elimination of Iraq’s weapons of
mass destruction. Britain has provided
130
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
considerable support to UNSCOM and the
International Atomic Energy Authority in the
form of personnel, equipment and information
since the first inspection in 1991.
In April 1995 Britain co-sponsored
Resolution 986, which was renewed in June
1997 by Resolution 1111, allowing Iraq to sell
oil worth US$1 billion every 90 days in
exchange for humanitarian goods. Although
implementation has been delayed on several
occasions because of the actions of the Iraqi
regime, goods supplied under these
resolutions are now beginning to arrive in
Iraq. Britain has also provided £94 million in
humanitarian aid to Iraq since 1992.
Southern Africa
Since the abolition of apartheid and the
election of President Mandela’s government in
1994, South Africa’s relations with Britain
have broadened into new areas, ranging from
development assistance to military advice, and
from sporting links to scientific co-operation.
There has also been a steady flow of state and
ministerial visits to and from South Africa.
In addition to recent aid packages, Britain
is supporting South Africa’s development
through trade and investment and through
official export credit guarantees. Britain is the
second highest exporter to South Africa and
its largest foreign investor. Nine of the top
twenty foreign employers in South Africa are
British. There is a British investment
promotion scheme designed to encourage
more small and medium-sized businesses to
invest in the region. South Africa also has a
significant investment in Britain.
Asia-Pacific Region
Britain maintains close relations with Japan,
China, the Republic of Korea, many South
East Asian countries, Australia and New
Zealand. It has defence links with some
countries in the region, including the loan of a
garrison to Brunei.
In South Asia the Indo-British Partnership
initiative, established in 1993, has
strengthened commercial relations between
Britain and India. Bilateral trade has doubled
in four years and Britain is India’s second
largest new investor. In Pakistan, Britain is the
largest foreign investor, with bilateral trade up
by almost 50 per cent in the last five years.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh
paid a State Visit to India and Pakistan in
October 1997 as part of these countries’ 50th
anniversary of independence celebrations. A
number of other high-profile events to mark
the anniversary took place in Britain and
South Asia. Highlights included, in India, the
largest exhibition of British Museum treasures
ever mounted overseas and the Indo-British
Partnership’s biggest trade fair to date. In
Pakistan the ‘Traditions of Respect’ exhibition
celebrated the cultural links between Britain
and Islam.
Britain has stepped up political dialogue
with countries in the region and has developed
British commercial activity through more
trade and investment and the setting up of
business councils, joint commissions or
industrial co-operation agreements. In
addition Britain is taking advantage of
increased opportunities for English language
teaching, co-operation in science and
technology, and educational exchanges.
Britain has welcomed the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) process inaugurated in
Bangkok in March 1996. ASEM is intended to
balance existing transatlantic and transpacific
relationships and foster closer economic and
political ties between EU countries and
Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic
of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. In April
1998 Britain will host the second Europe-Asia
summit, and will work for enhanced dialogue
and measures of co-operation, particularly on
trade and investment.
Hong Kong
At the end of June 1997 the British dependent
territory of Hong Kong was returned to
Chinese sovereignty under the provisions of the
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which
contains guarantees about Hong Kong’s way of
life for the next fifty years. Hong Kong’s return
to China was necessary because of the expiry of
the 99-year lease under which the vast majority
of the territory was transferred by China to
Britain under the 1898 Peking Convention.
131
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
As set out in the Joint Declaration, Hong
Kong is a Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China. Apart from the fields of
foreign affairs and defence, the Hong Kong
SAR enjoys a high degree of autonomy,
maintaining its own government. Its capitalist
economy and freedoms, including its social
systems, will remain intact for at least the next
fifty years. The Sino-British Liaison group
will remain in existence until 2000 to discuss
matters relating to the implementation of the
Joint Declaration. A major area of
disagreement has been China’s decision to
replace the Legislative Council elected in 1995
with an appointed provisional legislature. The
SAR government has announced that elections
will be held for a new legislature in May 1998.
Britain is represented in Hong Kong by its
largest consulate-general in the world. As a co¬
signatory of the Joint Declaration, Britain will
continue to have strong responsibilities
towards Hong Kong and the 3.5 million
British passport holders living there. In
addition, Hong Kong is Britain’s second
largest export market in Asia.
The Americas
Links between Britain, the United States and
Canada are uniquely close, all three countries
sharing a common commitment to democracy
and free enterprise. The British Government
believes that this transatlantic relationship
remains essential to guarantee the security and
prosperity of Europe and North America. All
three countries meet at the negotiating table in
almost all the major international
organisations.
Britain and the US co-operate especially
closely on nuclear, defence and intelligence
matters. As founding members of NATO,
Britain and the US are deeply involved in
Western defence arrangements (see p. 143)
and, as permanent members of the UN
Security Council, work closely together on
major international issues.
There are also important economic links.
Britain is the largest foreign investor in the
US; about 1 million jobs have been created in
the US by British investment worth £82,500
million. Over 40 per cent of US investment in
Europe comes to Britain. The US and EU
markets account for more than 50 per cent of
world trade and 7 5 per cent of all overseas
investment.
Strong links are also maintained with
Canada, with whom Britain shares
membership of the Commonwealth, NATO
and other key international organisations.
Britain is the second largest foreign investor in
Canada and its third largest trading partner.
Strongly supported by Britain, Canada
recently reached agreement with the EU on a
framework for co-operation on a wide range of
issues.
Important British connections with Latin
America date from the participation of British
volunteers in the wars of independence in the
early 19th century. Britain has welcomed the
fact that democratically elected governments
are now the norm in the region; this, together
with the trend towards freer market
economies, has enabled Britain to strengthen
its relations with Latin American
governments. As a result of the free market
economic policies and economic growth of the
last few years, British investment has
increased, making it the largest investor in the
region after the United States.
ARMS CONTROL
Because of the global reach of modern weapons,
Britain has a clear national interest in preventing
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and promoting international control.
Weapons of Mass Destruction
Nuclear Weapons
The main instrument for controlling nuclear
weapons is the 1968 Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Britain took an
active part in negotiating the Treaty and more
recently in securing its indefinite extension in
1995. It will also fully participate in the
preparatory meetings leading up to the next
NPT Review Conference.
Britain played an important role in
negotiations on the recently agreed Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty, which it signed in
September 1996. It is contributing about 6 per
cent of the budget of the Preparatory
132
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Commission of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty Organisation, responsible for verifying
the Treaty through on-site inspections.
Britain has also made reductions in its
nuclear forces. The new Government is
committed to the goal of the global elimination
of nuclear weapons and is determined to press
for multilateral negotiations towards mutual,
balanced and verifiable reductions in such
weapons. During the current strategic defence
review, which is foreign-policy led, the
Government will be considering how best to
implement these commitments (see chapter 10).
Biological Weapons
Britain is playing a leading part in promoting
the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention,
which provides for a worldwide ban on such
weapons. Unfortunately, it has no effective
verification mechanism. Britain is currently
leading international efforts to formulate such
measures for inclusion in a Protocol to the
Convention. These include mandatory
declarations of key facilities and challenge
inspections to address concerns about possible
non-compliance.
Chemical Weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which entered into force in April 1997,
provides for a worldwide ban on chemical
weapons. The Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is
responsible for verification. During the
negotiations Britain made major contributions
to drawing up extensive and effective
verification provisions. All the necessary
British legislation is in place to license the
production, possession and use of the most
toxic chemicals and to implement the
Convention’s trade controls. Some 100
countries have ratified the Convention.
Conventional Weapons
Britain and its NATO Allies have ratified a
number of agreements which enhance security
and stability in Europe. Britain is committed
to work with its Allies and other European
countries to develop and improve these
agreements in the light of the changing
security environment.
The main agreements are:
• the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE) Treaty, which reduces
and limits the numbers of five categories
of heavy weapons in the 30 countries of
NATO and the former Warsaw Pact, and
includes an intrusive verification regime.
The CFE Treaty is widely regarded as
the linchpin of European security; over
50,000 heavy weapons have been
destroyed by the treaty signatories.
• the Vienna Document, developed under
the auspices of the OSCE, which is a
binding agreement by 54 states on the
promotion of stability and openness on
military matters in Europe; it contains a
wide range of confidence and security
building measures, including verification
arrangements.
• the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which,
when it enters into force, will provide for
the overflight and photography of the
entire territory of the 27 participating
states to monitor their military
capabilities and activities. The treaty will
Landmines
In May 1997 the new Government
announced an immediate moratorium on
the operational use of anti-personnel
landmines. This will become a ban by 2005
or earlier if an effective international treaty
enters into force. The Government also
announced that it will introduce a ban on
the manufacture, import and transfer of
anti-personnel landmines. In addition,
Britain is taking part in negotiations in
Ottawa (the ‘Ottawa Process’) through
which nearly 100 countries are seeking to
draw up an international treaty to ban the
production, stockpiling, export and use of
mines. Since 1991 Britain has committed
more than £31 million, in close co¬
operation with international and non¬
governmental organisations, to
humanitarian demining activities.
133
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
enter into force when ratified by Russia,
Belarus and Ukraine.
In 1991 Britain was instrumental in
establishing the UN Register of Conventional
Arms, which came into effect in 1992. The
aim of the Register is to introduce greater
transparency in international transfers of
conventional arms and to help identify
excessive arms build-up in any one country or
region. The new British Government has
pledged to strengthen the Register by
encouraging greater disclosure of information
on arms exports and arms transfers by all
countries.
Export Controls
In addition to efforts to control weapons of
mass destruction and conventional arms, it is
also necessary to control the export of
conventional arms and so-called dual-use
goods. The latter may have a quite legitimate
civilian use but could also have a military
application. Britain participates actively in all
the major international export control regimes.
In July 1997 the British Government issued
new criteria for a responsible arms trade,
whereby export licences will not be granted if
there is a clearly identifiable risk that weapons
might be used for internal repression or
international aggression. At the same time it
banned the export of certain equipment for
which there is clear evidence that it has been
used for torture or other abuses; it also
declared its commitment to preventing British
companies from manufacturing, selling or
procuring such equipment and to pressing for
a global ban. An annual report to Parliament
on strategic export controls and their
application is to be produced.
The Government supports the
introduction of a European Union Code of
Conduct setting high common standards to
govern arms exports from all EU countries.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Universal respect for human rights is an
obligation under the UN Charter, reinforced
by human rights law in the form of UN and
regional human rights treaties. Expressions of
concern about human rights do not, therefore,
constitute interference in the internal affairs of
another state. The new Government has
announced that it will publish an annual
report on its work in promoting human rights
abroad and has stated that the protection and
promotion of human rights are at the centre of
its foreign policy.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted by the UN General
Assembly in 1948. Since this is not a legally
binding document, the General Assembly
adopted two international covenants in 1966,
placing legal obligations on those states
ratifying or acceding to them. The covenants
came into force in 1976, Britain ratifying both
in the same year. One covenant deals with
economic, social and cultural rights and the
other with civil and political rights. States
which are parties to the covenants undertake
to submit periodic reports detailing
compliance with their terms. Each covenant
has a UN treaty monitoring committee which
examines these reports. Britain recognises the
competence of these committees to receive
and consider state-to-state complaints. Other
international conventions to which Britain is a
party include those on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• the rights of the child;
• torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
• the prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery; and
• the status of refugees.
Council of Europe
Britain is bound by the Council of Europe’s
Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
covers:
• the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
• the right to marry and have a family;
• freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
134
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
• freedom of expression, including
freedom of the press;
• freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
• the right to have a sentence reviewed by a
higher tribunal; and
• the prohibition of torture and inhuman
or degrading treatment.
Complaints about violations of the
Convention are made to the European
Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Although one state may lodge a complaint
against another, most complaints are brought
against states by individuals or groups. The
Commission decides whether cases are
admissible and, if so, examines the matter with
the parties with a view to achieving a
settlement. If this fails, the Commission or the
state concerned can refer the case to the
European Court of Human Rights, which
rules on whether the Convention has been
breached. Britain has signed and ratified the
11th Protocol to the Convention, which
replaces the existing Commission and Court
with a full-time Court.
The new Government has announced that
it will incorporate the main provisions of the
Council of Europe Convention into British
law, thereby ensuring swifter adjudication of
any complaints by British citizens about
alleged violations of the Convention by any
British public authority (see p. 52).
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s human rights body, the Office
for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights (in Warsaw), is responsible for
furthering human rights, democracy and the
rule of law. It provides a forum for meetings
and expert seminars to discuss the
implementation of commitments in the area of
human rights. The Office shares and
exchanges information on the building of
democratic institutions and the holding of
elections in participating states. It also co¬
ordinates the monitoring of elections and
provides expertise and training on
constitutional and legal matters.
British observers formed part of the OSCE
mission sent to Albania in 1997 to monitor a
general election.
Westminster Foundation for Democracy
The Westminster Foundation for Democracy,
an independent non-departmental public body
established in 1992, provides assistance in
building and strengthening pluralist
democratic institutions overseas. It receives an
annual grant from the FCO and raises funds
through donations from other organisations.
The three main political parties (see p. 61)
have representation on the Foundation’s
Board of Governors; these are appointed by
the Foreign Secretary after consultations with
the parties. There is also a representative from
one of the smaller political parties and non-
party figures drawn from business, trade
unions, the academic world, the media and
other non-government sectors.
The British Government has no right of
veto over the projects which the Board
chooses to support. The FCO provides a non¬
voting member of the Board to act as a
channel of communications and provide
factual advice when required.
Efforts are being concentrated on Central
and Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia,
and Anglophone Africa. The Foundation also
gives sympathetic consideration to worthwhile
projects in other parts of the world.
INTERNATIONAL CRIME
Britain and the other members of the
European Union have agreed not to export
arms or other military equipment to countries
clearly implicated in supporting terrorist
activity, and to take steps to prevent such
material being diverted for terrorist purposes.
It is EU policy that no concessions should be
made to terrorists or their sponsors, and that
there should be solidarity among member
states in the prevention of terrorism.
Britain participates actively in international
forums on co-operation against the illegal
drugs trade, maintains a substantial
programme of overseas assistance in this field
and stations drug liaison officers in a number
135
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
of countries in order to work with the host
authorities in the fight against drug
trafficking. Britain is one of the main
contributors to the UN International Drug
Control Programme, providing £2.5 million
in 1996-97. In 1995, a British-French
initiative to combat drug trafficking in the
Caribbean secured support from the EU, and
has since been extended to Latin America.
Both countries are also looking at a similar
programme in Central Asia.
EU member states have agreed to set up a
European Police Office (EUROPOL) in
order to support investigations and
operations conducted by national law
enforcement agencies into serious and
organised international crime such as illegal
drug trafficking. EUROPOL powers and
duties are set out in the EUROPOL
Convention currently subject to ratification
by EU member states.
EU member states also belong to the
International Criminal Police Organisation
(INTERPOL). British liaison with
INTERPOL is provided by the National
Criminal Intelligence Service (see p. 93).
Co-operation between the governments of
EU member states on justice and home
affairs takes place under the provisions of the
Maastricht Treaty (see p. 124). A number of
conventions have been agreed under these
arrangements, including those on
EUROPOL, extradition and the protection of
the EU’s financial interests.
Britain plays a leading role in supporting
international and regional initiatives to
counter money-laundering.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
In 1995-96 Britain’s overseas aid programme
(the sixth largest in the world) amounted to
£2,610 million. Of this, 87 per cent went to
developing countries and 11 per cent to
countries in transition in Central and Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union. (The
rest comprises mainly administrative costs.)
About 53 per cent was given directly to
individual countries and the remainder
channelled through international bodies,
such as the European Union, the United
Nations and the World Bank group of
institutions. In addition, over £280 million
was invested in developing countries by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation in
1995-96 (see below). Some of the aid budget
goes to programmes administered by the
British Council (see p. 140) and by non¬
governmental organisations such as Oxfam
and Save the Children Fund.
Under the new Government, Britain’s aid
programme is being concentrated on
improved access for poor people to essential
health and basic education services and on
finding ways to increase the incomes of
smallholder farmers and the urban poor. An
overall policy review of the programme has
been conducted in order to ensure that the aid
effort is focused on eliminating poverty and
helping the human development of the
poorest people, as well as supporting the
process of transition in Central and Eastern
Europe and Central Asia in a way that ensures
that the benefits are spread throughout
society. The Government has stressed
Britain’s commitment to reaching the United
Nations target of donor countries providing
0.7 per cent of their gross national product on
aid programmes for poor countries.
Britain has welcomed a report by the
OECD’s Development Assistance Committee
which proposes that the number of people living
in extreme poverty should be halved by 2015.
The report proposes universal primary
education in all countries, progress towards
equality for women and improvements in
healthcare and mortality rates. Britain also
supports the conclusion of the UN human
development report for 1997 that the elimination
of poverty is both affordable and achievable.
Britain believes that, in addition to aid
programmes, development policies must be
concerned with issues like trade, debt and
agriculture. Otherwise the aid programme
can merely lessen the impact of other policies
which can create impoverishment, for
example trade barriers by rich countries to
imports from developing countries.
Economic Management and the Private
Sector
Britain has worked closely with developing
countries to promote sound economic
136
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
management and sensibly regulated market
economies. It believes that governments and
markets must work together to ensure viable
development and that neither the public nor
private sector has complete answers acting in
isolation from the other.
Under the aid programme, British experts
have been helping countries design and
implement changes to their economies, for
example, tax reform, civil service reform and
management of the financial sector. Aid is also
used to support imports of essential goods and
pay for important public services.
Britain is also encouraging the creation of
co-operatives in order to manage a communal
resource, share risk or increase the power of
individuals in the market. In its view co¬
operatives represent a useful middle way
between centralised state control and the free
market by balancing profit-seeking with social
goals. Discussions have been held with the
International Co-operative Alliance to see how
the British aid programme can learn from
experience in other countries.
The Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) encourages private sector
investment in developing countries. It
provides loans, equity funds and management
services for financially viable investments in
agriculture, fisheries, minerals, industry,
transport, communications and housing. By
the end of 1996 it had invested £1,560 million
in 393 enterprises in 54 countries. The
Government is to sell a majority of its stake in
the CDC, with all the proceeds going to the
British aid programme.
Britain wants to see more private
investment in the poorest countries while
recognising that they will continue to depend
on substantial resource transfers from richer
countries in order to generate sustainable
development.
Ethical Trading
Following expressions of concern among
many British consumers about the working
conditions of people in developing countries,
the Department for International
Development is working with consumer,
investor and producer groups to see whether
international codes for ethical trading can be
achieved. All the major supermarket chains in
Britain are involved in these discussions.
Good Government
Assistance for good government has been a
major priority for the British aid programme
on the grounds that successful development
will be impossible without it. In 1995-96 there
were 167 new projects designed to help
promote democracy, human rights and the
rule of law. British assistance has included:
• support for civil service and local
government reform;
• electoral assistance;
• reform of the police and judiciary;
• projects to control corruption; and
• advice on the promotion and protection
of human rights.
Debt Relief
Britain has cancelled debts owed to it in aid
loans by over 30 of the poorest countries. It
has also initiated a number of schemes for debt
relief, including the present rescheduling
arrangements agreed by western creditor
governments (the Paris Club) in 1995. These
terms will shortly make possible up to 80 per
cent relief on the eligible debt of the poorest,
most indebted countries that have a good
record of economic reform. Britain is pressing
the leading international financial institutions,
such as the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, to provide increased debt
relief for the poorest, most indebted countries.
When granting debt relief Britain wants to
ensure that such relief contributes to economic
development and lasting poverty reduction.
Education
British aid to education has focused on
primary and tertiary education, concentrating
on key areas such as:
• curriculum development;
• teacher education;
• examination reform;
137
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
• the development of learning materials,
including books;
• the planning, financing and
administration of education; and
• the provision of school buildings and
equipment.
Over 5 million primary school children
have learnt to read and write in South Africa,
Namibia and Botswana as a result of the
Molteno project, supported by Britain since
1980. Children are first taught to read and
write in their own languages and then go on to
learn English. Another British-aided project
has assisted the government of Malawi, in
consultation with parents, to provide primary
schools in locations where they are most
needed. In 1997 Britain announced that it
would provide £41 million to assist the
government of India to implement a seven-
year district primary education programme in
West Bengal.
In 1995-96 some 9,000 students and
trainees from developing countries, mainly
postgraduates, received British support to
study and train in Britain under technical co¬
operation training arrangements and three
scholarship schemes—the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, the British
Chevening Scholarships (see p. 455) and the
Shared Scholarships Scheme. Part of Britain’s
grant aid to South Africa provides bursaries
and loans to 1,000 university and technical
students from disadvantaged communities
studying science, engineering, commerce and
medicine.
Health
Britain aims to help countries obtain the best
possible use of limited resources by improving
the effectiveness and coverage of health
services, in particular by increasing access to
essential healthcare for women and children.
Six per cent of bilateral aid is spent on health
and population activities.
Through its ‘Children by Choice, Not
Chance’ policy, Britain has sought to ensure
that more people receive good-quality family
planning services and to enable women to go
through pregnancy and childbirth more safely.
At the 1994 Cairo conference, Britain pledged
itself to make commitments of £100 million in
the next two years: the pledge was exceeded,
and 112 projects worth over £184 mllion were
approved in 1994 and 1995.
The British aid programme has also
focused on the reduction of suffering from
communicable diseases, especially
tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS. In 1995
Britain was the largest bilateral donor to the
World Health Organisation’s anti-tuberculosis
programme. Britain has also strongly
supported the establishment of the new joint
UN programme on HIV/AIDS.
Britain has been funding a strong
programme of research and development—
about £9 million annually—in four priority
health areas:
• healthcare management and health sector
reform;
• reproductive health;
• communicable diseases; and
• healthcare in unstable living
environments.
Promoting Opportunities for Women
In the last few years Britain has made
considerable progress in supporting the
advancement of women in the aid programme.
In 1995-96 over 11 per cent of bilateral aid
was targeted at improving women’s as well as
men’s needs, since making women and men
more equal will improve the quality of life for
people in poorer countries.
At the Fourth World Conference on
Women in Peking in 1995 the governments of
189 countries committed themselves to the
long-term goal of gender equality. Projects
designed to help women and girls gain greater
access to education, health and incomes will
continue to play a key role in the British aid
programme.
The Environment
Protection and sustainable management of the
environment are key aims of the British aid
programme. In 1995-96 Britain committed over
£153 million bilaterally to support 182 projects
aimed at protecting the environment, promoting
cleaner technologies or supporting sustainable
138
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
agriculture. Britain has also ratified a UN
Convention aimed at combating desertification
in Africa and mitigating its effects.
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is
a trust fund of over US$2,000 million which
helps developing countries and countries with
economies in transition to meet the
incremental costs of protecting the world’s
environment in four main areas:
• climate change;
• biodiversity;
• pollution of international waters; and
• protection of the ozone layer (for
countries in transition only).
Britain is the Fund’s fifth largest donor and
is committed to a further substantial
replenishment to the GEF later in 1997.
Climate Change
Britain signed the Convention on Climate
Change at the 1992 Earth Summit and ratified
it in the following year. During the recent
special UN General Assembly discussions on
progress made since Rio, Britain expressed
strong concern at the failure of the
international community, especially the richer
countries, to implement fully the
commitments agreed in 1992.
In 1995-96 Britain committed £32 million
for development projects designed to promote
energy efficiency and assist developing
countries to reduce pollution from greenhouse
gas emissions.
Ozone Depletion
The Montreal Protocol’s Multilateral Fund
helps developing countries to meet some of
the extra costs of phasing out ozone-depleting
substances. By the end of 1996, Britain had
committed £27 million to the Fund.
Biodiversity
The Rio Biodiversity Convention, which
Britain signed in June 1992 and ratified a year
later, requires countries to take action to halt
the loss of animal and plant species and
preserve genetic resources, and to produce
plans for conserving them.
Britain is helping countries to fulfil their
obligations under the Convention through its
contributions to the GEF, the British bilateral
aid programme, and the Darwin Initiative for
the Survival of Species, which was launched at
the Earth Summit in 1992. Since 1994 Britain
has committed £81 million to projects
promoting biodiversity.
Forestry
Britain is supporting about 251 forestry
projects in 74 countries at a total cost of over
£174 million. The aim is to help developing
countries utilise their forests sustainably and
to reduce the rate of deforestation. When
sustainably managed, forests can be an
invaluable resource for communities in
developing countries and represent a major
habitat for biological diversity. Forests are also
important for the world’s climate, since trees
absorb carbon dioxide, a gas which contributes
to global warming.
Natural Resources
Britain has spent some £145 million a year on
helping developing countries to promote
sustainable and efficient management of their
renewable resources in agriculture, forestry
and fisheries. This involves working directly
with communities as well as helping
governments to formulate and implement
appropriate policies. Examples of British
natural resources programmes have included:
• helping Botswana develop better
rangelands and wildlife management
systems;
• working through the non-governmental
organisation CARE to help farmers in
Bangladesh farm fish in their rice fields;
and
• developing sustainable land-use systems
in the buffer zones around national parks
and protected areas in Bolivia.
Britain also spends around £32 million a
year on technology development and research
in agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries.
139
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
Britain is a founder member of, and
contributor to, the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research. The
Group’s research helps to increase the supply
of staple foods, preserve plant genetic
resources and strengthen science in
developing countries.
Emergency Relief
The Department for International
Development’s Disaster Unit co-ordinates
Britain’s provision of humanitarian aid, such as
financial grants, tents, blankets and medical
supplies, or staff with needed skills. The unit
works closely with the International Red Cross
and Red Crescent, the European Union and
voluntary agencies. It also mounts its own
response to emergencies overseas.
In 1995-96 Britain spent some £271 million
on emergencies, 22 per cent of which was
channelled through non-governmental
organisations.
Following a devastating volcanic eruption on
Montserrat, a British Dependent Territory (see
p. 123), in June 1997, Britain’s emergency
response included the provision of transport
and communications, fuel and food supplies,
and funds to help build emergency shelter and
maintain hospital services.
CULTURAL RELATIONS
The British Council is Britain’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas. Its
purpose is to promote a wider knowledge of
Britain and the English language and to
encourage cultural, scientific, technological
and educational co-operation between Britain
and other countries. The Council:
• helps people to study, train or make
professional contacts in Britain;
• enables British specialists to teach, advise
or establish joint projects abroad;
• teaches English and promotes its use;
• provides library and information services;
• promotes scientific and technical training,
research collaboration and exchanges; and
• makes British arts and literature more
widely known.
The Council works in 228 towns and cities
in 109 countries. It runs 209 libraries and
information centres which have about 450,000
members borrowing some 10 million books,
videos and tapes each year. The Council funds
over 9,000 scientific visits and some 1,300
research links. Additionally, it administers over
450,000 British professional and academic
examinations each year. The Council is
financed partly by a grant from the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office. The training and
education programmes organised by the
Council as part of the British aid programme
are another important aspect of the
organisation’s work, for which it receives
funding from the Department for International
Development. One-third of its income comes
from other earnings such as, for example, fees
earned from administration of examinations or
from English language teaching.
Educational Exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by
British experts, encourages cultural exchange
visits, and organises academic interchange
between British universities and colleges and
those in other countries.
The British aid programme has helped
fund certain Council programmes, such as:
• recruitment of staff for overseas
universities;
• secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments; and
• organisation of short-term teaching and
advisory visits.
The Council’s Central Bureau for
Educational Visits and Exchanges focuses on
education for international understanding
through partnerships between educational
establishments, curriculum-related exchange
programmes, and workshops and conferences
related to professional international
experience. Information is also provided on
work, study and travel opportunities
worldwide. The Bureau is government-
funded and is the national agency in Britain
for many European Union education and
training programmes.

Britain’s defence policy supports its wider security policy, which is to maintain
the country’s freedom and territorial integrity, and that of its Dependent
Territories, as well as its ability to pursue its legitimate interests at home and
abroad. As a member of NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation),
Britain makes a significant contribution to maintaining stability throughout
Europe. The Government has initiated a Strategic Defence Review of Britain’s
security interests and requirements to ensure that its defence capabilities are
matched to changing international circumstances.
INTRODUCTION
In the immediate aftermath of the Cold War,
defence policy remained focused on the need
to protect Britain, through NATO, from any
reversal in the reforms being put in place in
Russia. The extent and pace of these reforms
has now made such a posture inappropriate.
However, Britain’s security and way of life
remain vulnerable to other risks and
challenges—including aggressive nationalism,
religious extremism or ethnic rivalry, state-
sponsored terrorism, organised crime, and the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
—and its defence policy must adapt
accordingly.
Defence policy is under examination as part
of the Strategic Defence Review announced
by the Government in May 1997. The
Review, which is foreign-policy-led, will
identify Britain’s interests and commitments,
and then decide how the armed forces should
be structured, equipped and deployed to meet
them. The aim is to complete the Review in
1998.
The main policy principles underlying the
Review are:
• the continued reliance on the collective
defence provided through NATO as the
basis of Britain’s security;
• the maintenance of strong conventional
forces;
• the maintenance of a national nuclear
deterrent until Britain is satisfied with
verifiable progress towards the goal of
global elimination of nuclear weapons, at
which point the Government will ensure
that Britain’s nuclear weapons are
included in multilateral negotiations; and
• a commitment to a strong defence
industry, which is a strategic part of
Britain’s industrial base as well as its
defence effort.
142
DEFENCE
Britain is determined to contribute to wider
international peace and security through
NATO and the Western European Union
(WEU—see p. 120), and through other
international organisations such as the
United Nations (UN—see p. 116) and the
Organisation for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE—see p. 120). The Strategic
Defence Review will not affect Britain’s place
as a permanent member of the UN Security
Council.
To achieve its policy objectives, Britain
requires forces with a high degree of military
effectiveness, at sufficient readiness and with a
clear sense of purpose, for combat operations,
conflict prevention, crisis management and
humanitarian activities. These forces must
therefore be flexible and able to undertake the
full spectrum of military tasks.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANISATION
NATO remains essential to the future of
Britain—a founder member of the Alliance—
and Europe. It was established in 1949, and is
the only forum binding North America to
European defence arrangements. It currently
has 16 members. Most of Britain’s forces are
assigned to NATO.
Adaptation of NATO
As part of its continuous post-Cold War
evolution, NATO has pursued a number of
important initiatives, including the
Partnership for Peace, the enlargement of
NATO, the development of close ties with
Russia and Ukraine, the development of a
stronger European defence identity, and the
creation of the Combined Joint Task Force
concept as part of a new command structure.
Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council
In June 1997 NATO established the Euro-
Atlantic Partnership Council to provide an
overarching framework for co-operation with
Partner countries in the Partnership for Peace.
The Partnership for Peace seeks to deepen
co-operative political and military ties between
NATO and the countries of central and
eastern Europe and of central Asia. It also
promotes better co-operation between military
forces engaged in multinational operations
such as peacekeeping, humanitarian relief and
other crisis management missions. NATO
currently has 27 Partner countries, including
Russia, almost all the central and eastern
European states, Sweden, Finland, Austria,
Malta and most of the central Asian and
Trans-Caucasian states of the former Soviet
Union.
Outreach
In addition to its work with NATO on the
Partnership for Peace, Britain conducts a wide
variety of bilateral defence activities through
its Outreach initiative, which now extends to
20 countries; in 1997 over 1,000 individual
activities took place. The focus and scope for
the programme complements and helps to
underpin Partnership for Peace.
Outreach also covers civilian areas of
interest to a rather greater extent than
Partnership for Peace, ranging from English
language training to military logistics
techniques and environmental management.
Relationships with Russia and Ukraine
NATO attaches great importance to building
up its relationships with Russia and Ukraine.
In May 1997 it signed with Russia the
NATO/Russia Founding Act, which provides
for an unprecedented level of consultation and
co-operation between NATO and Russia over
a wide range of security issues of mutual
interest, including the possibility of joint crisis
management operations under UN or OSCE
auspices. Similarly, NATO and Ukraine have
signed a Charter which underlines NATO’s
recognition of Ukraine’s role in European
security and provides a platform for increased
co-operation.
NA TO Enlargement
Following a study into the principles guiding
enlargement and their implication, NATO
143
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
agreed to intensify discussions with Partner
members interested in joining the Alliance. At
the 1997 Madrid Summit, NATO invited the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to begin
talks with a view to their becoming members
in 1999. This expansion is the largest in
NATO’s history. The Madrid Summit also
agreed that NATO would review the process
of enlargement at a further summit in 1999,
and would maintain dialogue with other
countries interested in membership.
Combined Joint Task Force
The Combined Joint Task Force concept is
being developed to enhance NATO’s ability to
command and control multinational and
multiservice forces, deployed at short notice,
which can conduct a wide range of operations,
including peacekeeping, under the auspices of
the UN and OSCE. It will also make possible
participation by non-NATO nations in
operations (as is already happening in
Bosnia—see p. 128), and, by enabling the
conduct of such operations to be led by the
WEU, will contribute to the development of
the European Security and Defence Identity
within NATO.
European Security and Defence Identity
Under the European Security and Defence
Identity, NATO assets and capabilities will be
available for WEU operations. The Alliance is
building this concept on solid military
principles, supported by appropriate military
planning; the aim is to permit the creation of
coherent and effective forces that can operate
under the political control and strategic
direction of the WEU.
BRITISH DEFENCE POLICY
British defence policy is designed to support
its security policy. It guides the contribution
of its armed forces to defence and security
goals, and shapes its force structures and
capabilities.
The aim of Britain’s defence policy is:
• to deter any threats to, and, if necessary,
defend the freedom and territorial
integrity of Britain and its Dependent
Territories, including the provision of
support as necessary for the civil
authorities in countering terrorism;
• to contribute to the promotion of
Britain’s wider security interests,
including the protection of freedom,
democratic institutions and free trade;
and
• thus to promote peace and help maximise
Britain’s international prestige and
influence.
In 1997 a new planning framework that will
support the formulation of Britain’s defence
policy was developed, based on the likely
missions in which the armed forces might
expect to be engaged. These missions will be
revised where necessary in the light of the
findings of the Strategic Defence Review, but
are currently:
• security of Britain and its citizens in
peacetime, including military aid to the
civil authorities;
• security of Britain’s Dependent
Territories;
• defence support to wider British
interests, which involves the provision of
forces to conduct military assistance and
training, and other activities to promote
British influence and standing at home
and abroad;
• support of international order and
humanitarian principles;
• responding to a regional conflict outside
NATO (but not an attack on NATO or
one of its members) which could
adversely affect European security, or
which could pose a serious threat to
British interests elsewhere or to
international security; and
• responding to a NATO regional crisis in
which an ally is attacked; or a strategic
attack on NATO.
Military tasks are allocated against these
missions, and provide the components for more
detailed planning. This is the mechanism by
which forces are matched to policy, and by
which capabilities, commitments and resources
are kept in balance.
144
DEFENCE
Britain and its Dependencies
The armed forces continue to have day-to-day
responsibility for safeguarding Britain’s
territory, airspace and territorial waters. They
also provide for the security and reinforcement,
as necessary, of the Dependent Territories and,
when required, support for the civil authorities
in Britain and the Dependent Territories.
Maritime Defence
The Royal Navy ensures the integrity of
British territorial waters and the protection of
British rights and interests in the surrounding
seas. The maintenance of a 24-hour, year-
round presence in British waters provides
considerable reassurance to merchant ships
and other mariners. The Royal Air Force
(RAF) also contributes to maritime
requirements, for instance through the
Nimrod MR2 force, which provides air
surveillance of surface vessels and submarines.
Land Defence
Army units committed to the defence of
Britain, its Dependent Territories and the
Sovereign Bases in Cyprus include 21 Regular
Infantry battalions and seven Home Service
battalions. Tasks include contributing to the
security of national and NATO nuclear forces,
military support to the machinery of
government in war, military aid to the civil
power throughout Britain and its Dependent
Territories, maintaining the security of the
Dependent Territories, and State ceremonial
and public duties.
Air Defence
Air defence of Britain and the surrounding
seas is maintained by a system of layered
defences. Continuous radar cover is provided
by the Improved United Kingdom Air
Defence Ground Environment (IUKADGE),
supplemented by the NATO Airborne Early
Warning Force, to which the RAF contributes
six E.3D aircraft. The RAF also provides six
squadrons of all-weather Tornado F3 air
defence aircraft, supported by tanker aircraft
and, in wartime, an additional F3 squadron.
Royal Navy air defence destroyers can be also
linked to the IUKADGE, providing radar and
electronic warfare coverage and surface-to-air
missiles. Ground-launched Rapier missiles
defend the main RAF bases. Naval aircraft
also contribute to British air defence.
Overseas Garrisons
Britain maintains garrisons in Gibraltar, the
Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus and the
Falkland Islands. In addition, Gibraltar
provides headquarters and communications
facilities for NATO in the western
Mediterranean, while Cyprus acts as a base for
operations in the Middle East and North
Africa. The garrison on the Falkand Islands,
which has been in place since 1982, guarantees
the Islands’ security.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces provide support to the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in
maintaining law and order and countering
terrorism. Up to 18 major units are assigned to
the infantry role in Northern Ireland,
including six Home Service battalions of the
Royal Irish Regiment. The number of those
major units deployed to the Province at any
one time is dependent on the prevailing
security situation. The Royal Navy patrols
territorial waters around Northern Ireland and
its inland waterways in order, among other
things, to deter and intercept the movement of
terrorist weapons. The Royal Marines provide
troops to meet Navy and Army commitments,
while the RAF provides elements of the RAF
Regiment and Chinook, Wessex and Puma
helicopters.
Other Tasks
Other tasks include the provision of:
• military assistance to civil ministries,
including assistance to maintain the
essentials of life in the community and
carrying out work of national importance,
providing fishery protection duties, and
helping in the fight against drugs;
145
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
• military aid to the civil community,
including during emergencies; and
• military search and rescue.
Britain and its Allies
The foundation of Britain’s defence is
provided through its membership of NATO.
Maritime Forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO. Permanent contributions are made to
NATO’s standing naval forces in the Atlantic,
the English Channel and the Mediterranean.
The main components of the Fleet are:
• three aircraft carriers operating Sea
Harrier aircraft and Sea King anti¬
submarine helicopters;
• 35 destroyers and frigates;
• 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines;
and
• amphibious forces, including two assault
ships and a new helicopter carrier due to
enter service in 1998.
For information on Britain’s independent
nuclear deterrent see p. 147.
Land Forces
The multinational Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is the key land
component of NATO’s Rapid Reaction
Forces. Britain is the ‘framework nation’ for
the Corps. Capable of deploying up to four
NATO divisions, the ARRC is commanded by
a British general, and some 55,000 British
regular troops are assigned to it. This includes
Britain’s contribution of some 60 per cent of
the headquarters staff and Corps level combat
support and combat service support units.
Britain also provides two of the ten divisions
available to the Corps—an armoured division
of three armoured brigades stationed in
Germany, and a mechanised division of two
mechanised brigades and an airborne brigade
based in Britain. An air-mobile brigade,
assigned to one of the Corps’ two multinational
divisions, is also located in Britain.
Air Forces
The RAF makes a major contribution to
NATO’s Immediate and Rapid Reaction
Forces. Around 100 fixed-wing aircraft and 40
helicopters are allocated to them. Tornado F3
and Rapier surface-to-air missiles form part of
the Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s
Immediate Reaction Force; while Harrier and
Tornado GR1 and GRla aircraft provide
offensive support and tactical reconnaissance
for the Rapid Reaction Force. Chinook and
Puma helicopters provide troop airlift facilities
for the ARRC or other deployed land forces.
Tornado F3, Tornado GRlb and Nimrod
aircraft provide air defence, attack and anti¬
submarine capabilities for NATO’s Maritime
Reaction Forces.
Modified RAF Tornado GR1 aircraft
(designated GRlb), equipped with the Sea
Eagle missile, have the task of maritime attack.
The RAF will continue to provide Nimrod
maritime patrol aircraft and search and rescue
helicopters.
Four Tornado GR1 strike/attack
squadrons and two Harrier offensive support
squadrons are stationed in Germany at RAF
Bruggen and RAF Laarbruch. It is planned
that RAF Laarbruch will close in 1999 and,
subject to consultation, RAF Bruggen will
close in 2002; the aircraft squadrons currently
based there will be withdrawn to existing bases
in Britain. Meanwhile these aircraft and
personnel, alongside the continuing and
significant Army presence in Germany, are a
visible sign of Britain’s commitment to the
defence of Europe.
Other Forces
Britain contributes to NATO’s Maritime
Augmentation Forces. These are held at the
lowest state of readiness and in peacetime
comprise ships mainly in routine refit or
maintenance. It also contributes special forces
to support reaction and main defence force
deployments for surveillance, reconnaissance,
offensive action and military assistance
operations. Troops held for national defence
could also be allocated to NATO. The United
Kingdom Amphibious Force, together with its
Dutch counterpart, is assigned to the Supreme
146
DEFENCE
Allied Commander Atlantic for the
reinforcement of Norway and could be
deployed by the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe, for example, with the ARRC. The
Force is also a candidate for a range of WEU
operations. RAF fighter, maritime patrol and
transport aircraft will also be available for
WEU operations.
Wider Security Interests
Military tasks to promote Britain’s wider
security interests may be undertaken
unilaterally or multilaterally with support
from NATO or directly for UN or OSCE
operations.
United Nations Operations
Britain remains committed to UN operations.
Contingents are currently deployed in Cyprus,
where Britain is the largest UN contributor,
and Iraq/Kuwait, where RAF Tornado GRls,
supported by VC 10 tanker aircraft, are
policing the no-fly zones (see p. 128).
Other Operational Deployments
Royal Navy ships of the Armilla Patrol
continue to provide reassurance and assistance
to entitled merchant shipping in the Gulf area
and regularly participate in maritime exercises
with navies of Gulf states and Gulf war
coalition allies. The Patrol also conducts
interception and boarding operations to ensure
that ships do not breach UN sanctions against
Iraq (see p. 130).
The number of operations against
trafficking in illicit drugs has increased in
recent years, especially in the Caribbean,
where the West Indies Guardship and other
Royal Navy ships work closely with the
authorities of the United States, the
Dependent Territories and the Regional
Security System to combat drug trafficking.
Although primary responsibility for this work
rests with other government departments, the
armed forces assist where they can do so
without detriment to the performance of their
other military tasks.
British troops remain ready to participate
in operations or potential operations
throughout the world. In the past three years
in Africa alone, British troops have taken part
in UN and multinational forces in evacuation
operations in Rwanda, Somalia, Angola,
Liberia, the former Zaire and Sierra Leone.
British Garrisons
A British garrison is maintained in Brunei,
South-East Asia, at the request of the Brunei
Government. A British military presence is
maintained in Belize, Central America, in the
form of a jungle training support unit.
Military Assistance
During 1996—97, some 3,793 students from
140 countries attended military training
courses in Britain. On 1 June 1997, about 450
British service personnel were on loan,
secondment, or short-term training teams.
NUCLEAR FORCES
Britain will retain the Trident submarine force
to provide a minimum, but credible, nuclear
deterrent. The nuclear deterrent forces
provide the ultimate guarantee of national
security and make an importance contribution
to NATO’s policy of war prevention.
The Government is committed to the goal
of global elimination of nuclear weapons. Its
objective is to maintain strong defences to
counter the security challenges of the post-
Cold War world and to develop the stability in
which multilateral, balanced and verifiable
disarmament can become a sustainable reality.
Britain’s strategic and sub-strategic nuclear
capability is currently provided by Tornado
aircraft equipped with the WE 177 free-fall
nuclear bomb and three Vanguard class
ballistic missile submarines. The fourth
submarine will be ready to enter service
around the turn of the century. This four-boat
Trident fleet will ensure that continuous
deterrent patrols can be maintained
throughout the lifetime of the force.
The WE 177 bombs are being withdrawn
from service, a process to be completed by
March 1998, when the sub-strategic role will
be wholly undertaken by Trident.

EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
DEFENCE EQUIPMENT
PROGRAMMES
Modern equipment is essential if one of the
key aims of Britain’s force restructuring
programme is to be achieved, namely that of
increasing the flexibility and mobility of the
armed forces. The outcome of a Defence
Costs Study has enabled the front line (and its
essential operational support) to be preserved
and a number of important improvements in
the armed forces to be introduced.
Current and planned front-line
improvements for the Royal Navy equipment
programme include:
• the introduction of the fourth Trident
submarine and the rest of the missiles;
• the building of a second batch of
Trafalgar class submarines (to be named
the Astute class) to enter service early
next century, with a capability to carry
conventionally armed cruise missiles;
• a substantially modernised destroyer and
frigate fleet, including the introduction of
a new air defence frigate developed
collaboratively with France and Italy;
• a follow-on batch of seven Sandown class
single role minehunters;
• the introduction of a new helicopter
carrier, planned to enter service in 1998,
to enhance Britain’s amphibious forces;
• 18 new Sea Harrier F/A2 aircraft; and
• the building of replacements for the
assault ships Fearless and Intrepid.
The Army front line is being enhanced by:
• the introduction of an all-Challenger 2
tank fleet (386 in all);
• Westland Apache attack helicopters to
replace the Lynx in the anti-armour role;
• improved Rapier and new Starstreak
missiles to improve air defence;
• a medium-range anti-tank missile;
• bridging equipment to increase the
Army’s mobility and flexibility; and
• a new generation of combat radios.
Improvements for the RAF include:
• the Eurofighter from the beginning of the
next century, to replace Tornado F3 and
Jaguar aircraft;
• the upgrading of the Jaguar GRla (to
GR3), Tornado GR1 (to GR4), and
Tornado F3 aircraft;
• orders for 21 new Nimrod MRA4
maritime patrol aircraft;
• orders for new air-launched anti-armour
and stand-off missiles; and
• orders for further EH101 and Chinook
support helicopters and the introduction
of Hercules C130J aircraft from 1998.
Finally, the armed forces are to be equipped
with a new electronic question and answer
system, to improve their ability to distinguish
between friendly and potentially hostile forces.
THE ARMED FORCES
Personnel
In 1997 the strength of the armed forces was
around 112,700 in the Army, about 57,000 in
the RAF and about 46,000 in the Royal Navy.
Regular reserves totalled 258,000 and
volunteer reserves 63,300. Civilian staff
numbers are planned to fall from 123,200 (in
April 1997) to 112,800 (99,500 British-based
and 13,300 locally engaged) by 2002.
Commissioned Ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from the
ranks or by direct entry based on educational
and other qualifications, are granted for short,
medium and long terms. All three Services
have schemes for school, university and
college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force College,
Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, which may include degree courses at
service establishments or universities.
Courses for higher training for officers are
provided at a new Joint Services Command
and Staff College, established in January 1997.
This followed a Defence Costs Study proposal
148
DEFENCE
that such courses, formerly offered by single¬
service colleges, should be subsumed into a
tri-service course that would reinforce the
joint approach to the tactical and operational
levels of conflict. The new college is at present
operating from a number of sites, mainly
Bracknell, until a permanent base is ready at
Shrivenham in 1999.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks in
the Army and the RAF range from six months
to 22 years; they can be for a maximum of 37
years in the Royal Navy (22 years in the Royal
Marines). There is a wide choice of
engagement length and terms of service.
Subject to a minimum period of service,
entrants may leave at any time, giving 18
months’ notice (12 months for certain
engagements). Discharge may also be granted
on compassionate or medical grounds.
In addition to their basic training,
non-commissioned personnel receive
supplementary specialist training throughout
their careers. Study for educational
qualifications is encouraged and service trade
and technical training lead to nationally
recognised qualifications.
A new Army Foundation College will open
in September 1998, initially for some 600
students. Offering a 42-week course
combining military training and the
opportunity to acquire national qualifications,
it is intended to attract high-quality recruits
who will go on to fill senior posts in front-line
roles. Its funding through the Private Finance
Initiative is being investigated (see p. 160).
Reserve Forces
Reserve forces are a central component of
Britain’s armed forces. They include members
who become reservists following a period of
regular service (regular reserve); and
volunteers who train in their spare time.
Volunteer reserve forces include the Royal
Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve,
the Territorial Army and the Royal Auxiliary
Air Force. Reserves are available to support
regular forces, either as units or as individuals,
in times of tension or war. In particular,
reserves can provide skills and units not
available or required in peacetime. Reserves
are also a valuable link between the services
and the civil community. The Reserve Forces
Act 1996 allows more flexible use of the
reserves in roles such as peacekeeping,
humanitarian and disaster relief operations.
Gulf War Syndrome
In July 1997, the Government announced
a new j£2.5 million research programme
into the possible adverse health effects of
the combination of vaccines and tablets
given to British troops in the Gulf War in
1990-91 to protect them against the threat
of biological and chemical warfare. This
research is in response to the illnesses
suffered by a number of Gulf veterans who
served in the war against Iraq (see p. 130).
ADMINISTRATION
The Defence Budget
The defence spending plans announced in
November 1996 were £21,822 million,
£22,276 million and £22,832 million for
1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000
respectively. The new Government is only
committed to these plans for the first two
years. Under these plans, defence spending
will fall by 16 per cent in real terms between
1992-93 and 1997-98 and will amount to 2.6
per cent of gross domestic product (from 2.9
per cent in 1996—97). The current average for
NATO countries is 2.3 per cent.
Defence Management
The Ministry of Defence is not only a
Department of State, but also incorporates the
highest military headquarters of the armed
forces. A unified Central Staff made up of
military officers and civilians is responsible for
defence policy, resource allocation and
equipment requirements, direction of
operations at the highest level, and
management policy for the armed forces and
the Ministry of Defence.
149
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
The Procurement Executive is responsible
for the development and acquisition of
weapon systems. The day-to-day activities of
the armed forces are managed through
operational, personnel and logistics commands
outside London.
The Chief of Staff of the Defence Staff is
the professional head of the armed forces and
under him each Service’s Chief of Staff is
responsible for the fighting effectiveness,
efficiency and morale of his Service. They and
other senior officers and officials at the head of
the department’s main functions form the
Ministry of Defence’s corporate board,
chaired by the head of the department, the
Permanent Under-Secretary. The Secretary of
State chairs the Defence Council and is
responsible to Parliament for the formulation
and conduct of defence policy, and the
provision of the means to implement it.
Since 1991, military and civilian managers
have been given ever greater authority and
responsibility for fulfilling their objectives
through the most efficient use of the resources
allocated to them. The aim is to concentrate
resources on front-line capability, and
minimise the costs of essential support. Many
functions are now embodied in defence
agencies, each of which has a chief executive
who is accountable for its performance against
objectives and targets agreed by ministers.
The department has also exposed over 150
support activities to private sector
competition, with significant annual savings,
and is seeking, through the Private Finance
Initiative, to transfer the risk and capital cost
of certain projects to the private sector.
Defence Procurement
About 40 per cent of the defence budget is
spent on military equipment, including the
procurement of spares and associated costs.
When assessing options, a systematic approach
is taken to defence industrial factors and
particular consideration is given not just to the
initial procurement costs of a project, but also
to those necessary to support it throughout its
service life. Competition for contracts takes
place wherever possible and, in general, is open
to prime and sub-contractors from overseas.
Britain also seeks to promote market
liberalisation for defence equipment worldwide.
International Procurement Collaboration
International collaboration provides an
effective way of developing complex and
costly new-generation weapon systems at a
time of increasing production costs and
reduced defence budgets. Britain favours such
co-operation as a means of producing top-
quality products on a value-for-money basis,
and plays an active role in NATO’s
Conference of National Armaments Directors,
which promotes equipment collaboration
between NATO nations. It is also a member of
the WEU’s Western European Armaments
Group, which is the main European forum for
the discussion of armaments matters.
Current collaborative programmes include:
• development of the Eurofighter (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
• anti-tank guided weapons (with Belgium,
France, Germany and the Netherlands);
• a new air defence frigate (with France
and Italy);
• the Multiple Launch Rocket System
(with the United States, Germany,
France and Italy);
• the EH101 helicopter (with Italy);
• anti-air missiles (with France and Italy);
• a multi-role armoured vehicle (with
France and Germany); and
• a request for proposals for a Future
Large Aircraft (with Germany, France,
Italy, Spain and Turkey).

Following the recession of 1990-92, the British economy has experienced
continuous growth combined with low inflation; total output is currently 13 per
cent above the previous peak reached in 1990, although, within this overall
figure, manufacturing output is only just under 5 per cent higher. Major
contributions to growth have come from exports and consumer spending.
Notwithstanding this, long-term problems have left Britain with lower income
per head than other G7 countries. The Government’s economic policies are
directed towards the achievement of high and sustainable levels of growth and
employment within a dynamic market economy, enabling everyone to share in
higher living standards and greater job opportunities.
THE ECONOMY
The value of all goods and services produced
in the economy is measured by gross domestic
product (GDP). In 1996 GDP at current
factor cost (the cost of the goods and services
before adding taxes and subtracting subsidies)
totalled £642,916 million. Between 1986 and
1996 the index of GDP at constant factor cost
increased by 24 per cent.
Values for some of the main economic
indicators in selected years since 1986 are
shown in Table 11.1. Table 11.2 shows output
and employment in 1995 and 1996, and Table
11.3 compares GDP by industry in 1986 and
1996.
Output
During the past 25 years, Britain has
experienced slower growth of output and
productivity than any other member of the G7
group of major industrialised countries, and
GDP per head remains below that of other G7
countries. Economic stability has been
adversely affected by two of the deepest and
longest recessions since 1945, the latest
starting in 1990. After two years of continuous
decline, output began to rise in 1992.
Following an increase in GDP of 4.5 per cent
in 1994, economic growth slowed to 2.8 per
cent in 1995 and 2.5 per cent in 1996. In the
second quarter of 1997 GDP was 3.5 per cent
higher than a year earlier. The Government
expects the economy to grow by 3.25 per cent
in 1997 and 2.5 per cent in 1998. Consumer
spending is forecast to increase by 4.5 per cent
in 1997 and 4 per cent in 1998.
Recent decades have generally seen the
fastest growth in the services sector (see
chapter 16), which now accounts for around
two-thirds of GDP, compared with about a

half in 1950. Manufacturing (see chapter 15)
now contributes less than a quarter of GDP,
compared with over a third in 1950. During
the 1990s, services industries’ output has been
on an upward trend, with only a minor drop in
output during 1991 and 1992, reaching a
record level in 1996. In the second quarter of
1997, services’ output was 4.3 per cent higher
than a year earlier. Manufacturing growth
resumed slowly in 1992—93, and in 1994
output rose by 4.7 per cent, falling back to 1.7
per cent in 1995 and 0.3 per cent in 1996.
Oil and gas production has had a major
impact on the British economy since
substantial production of gas started in the late
1960s and oil began to be produced in
significant quantities in 1976. Gas production
has been increasing each year since 1989,
while oil production has also been rising
recently, with a new record output in 1995.
Oil and gas output was up by 7 per cent in
1996, and in the three months to August 1997
there was growth of 3.6 per cent compared
with the same period a year earlier. The
extraction of oil and gas accounted for 2.5 per
cent of GDP in 1996, while net exports of
crude oil and petroleum products contributed
a positive ^4,300 million to the current
account.
Investment and Profitability
Britain invested a smaller share of GDP than
any other G7 country in the last full
international economic cycle, between 1982
and 1993. Following growth of around 4 per
cent a year in the 1980s, investment in Britain
declined during the recession of the early

1990s. However, in 1996 investment increased
by 1.8 per cent and during the second quarter
of 1997 it was 2.4 per cent higher than a year
earlier, with a stronger rise in manufacturing
investment. The Government expects
investment in the economy to rise by 5 per
cent in 1997 and 6 per cent in 1998; business
investment is forecast to grow by 9.25 per cent
in 1997 and 6.25 per cent in the following year.
Between 1980 and 1996 the private sector’s
share of fixed capital investment increased
from 73 to 86 per cent, due in part to
privatisation (see p. 186). In the same period,
there was a rise in the share of investment
undertaken by the services sector and a fall in
that carried out by manufacturing. Table 11.4
shows investment by business sector.
The rate of return on capital employed in
non-oil industrial and commercial companies
in Britain increased in the 1980s to the highest
levels for 20 years. It then fell back, but since
1992 there has been a recovery. In 1996, net
profitability of industrial and commercial
companies reached 10.1 per cent, up from 9.5
per cent a year earlier, although the rise for
non-oil industrial and commercial companies
was smaller—from 9.0 to 9.2 per cent. These
latest profitability figures are approaching the
peak levels of the 1980s.
Inward Investment
Britain is recognised as a prime location for
inward direct investment and over 8,000
overseas companies are currently operating in
Britain, including some 4,500 from the United
States, over 1,000 from Germany and more
than 250 from Japan (see p. 210). In recent
years, Britain has received the greatest share of
inward investment into the European Union,
including about 40 per cent of Japanese and
US investment. It is second only to the
United States as a destination for international
direct investment.

expenditure, and exports of goods and services

Personal disposable income consists of
personal incomes after deductions—mainly
taxation and social security contributions.
Between 1986 and 1996 it rose by 32 per cent
in real terms to £427,690 million at 1990
prices (£537,677 million at current prices).
The increase in 1996 was 3.7 per cent in real
terms. Consumers’ expenditure rose by 3.5
per cent in real terms in 1996.
In 1996, 88 per cent of post-tax personal
income was spent and 12 per cent saved.
Table 11.6 shows the pattern of consumers’
expenditure in 1986 and 1996. Declining
proportions are being spent on food and
alcoholic drink, tobacco, clothing and
footwear, and fuel and power. Over the longer
term, as incomes rise, people tend to spend
increasing proportions on services. Spending
on leisure pursuits and tourism, health and
financial services have all shown significant
growth in recent years. Housing, food,
alcoholic drink, tobacco, clothing and
footwear, and fuel and power together
accounted for 44 per cent of the total in 1996.
The ratio of saving to personal disposable
income declined substantially during the 1980s,
to 6.2 per cent in 1988. However, it rose
strongly to reach 12 per cent in 1992, and has
subsequently remained above 10 per cent.
The proportion of total personal pre-tax
income accounted for by income from
employment was nearly 60 per cent in 1996.
Self-employment accounted for 10 per cent of
personal pre-tax income, and social security
benefits and other current grants from
government for 15 per cent.

Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
With the recent unprecedented conversion
by a number of major building societies to
banks and the flotation of a leading
insurance company (see chapter 16), many
of their members received shares in the
new concerns in 1997. The total value of
these ‘windfalls’ has been estimated at
around £35,000 million. Responses to a
MORI survey suggest that, while the
majority of these windfalls have been
saved, people intending to spend the
proceeds of their windfalls were planning
expenditure in areas such as home
improvements, holidays, cars and
household goods.
Inflation
Since 1971 inflation, as measured by the Retail
Prices Index (RPI, which records the price of
goods and services purchased by households in
Britain and is often referred to as ‘headline’
inflation), has ranged from a rise of 26.9 per cent
in August 1975 to one of only 1.2 per cent in
June 1993. In general, inflation has been at a
much lower level in the 1990s. The annual rate
was 3.6 per cent in September 1997. The RPI
excluding mortgage interest payments, a
measure of‘underlying’ inflation, was 2.7 per
cent in September 1997. Underlying inflation
has now been below 4 per cent for five years.
The Government’s forecast for underlying
inflation is 2.5 per cent at the end of 1997, rising
slightly in 1998 and then falling back to around
2.5 per cent by the middle of 1999.
Labour Market
Unemployment has fallen in recent years, but on
the International Labour Organisation measure
is still around 2 million in Great Britain (see
chapter 12). Unemployment increased during
the early 1990s, reaching nearly 3 million in
winter 1992—93, 10.6 per cent of the workforce.
Since then it has dropped by over 900,000, to its
lowest level for seven years. Following an
increase of about 3.3 million between 1983 and
1990, employment fell by nearly 1.5 million in
the early 1990s. With economic recovery,
employment levels have stabilised at an earlier
stage than in previous cycles and are now rising
gradually. In spite of large falls recently in
unemployment, the growth of average earnings
remains steady, at around 4.5 per cent a year.
Overseas Trade
Britain has an open economy in which
international trade plays a key role (see
155
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
chapter 14). The share of GDP accounted for
by exports of goods and services was 29 per
cent in 1996. Income from direct overseas
investments accounted for around 29 per cent
of all Britain’s investment income in 1996.
Membership of the European Union has
had a major impact on Britain’s pattern of
trade. Between 1972—the year before Britain
became a member—and 1996 the share of its
exports of goods going to other EU members
rose from 40 per cent to 57 per cent. Imports
have followed a similar trend.
Since 1983 Britain has had a deficit on its
trade in goods. In 1996 it stood at £12,598
million, over £1,000 million higher than in
1995. Nevertheless, visible exports have been
performing strongly, reflecting a sharp
recovery in world trade and despite a stronger
pound in 1997. Substantial earnings from
trade in services and from overseas
investments, which have continued to reach
record levels, kept the balance of payments
current account in surplus between 1980 and
1985. However, it has been in deficit since
then, although in 1996 it was close to balance,
with the deficit down to £435 million,
compared with £3,672 million in 1995. The
Government expects the current account
deficit to increase to £6,000 million in 1997
and to £9,000 million in 1998.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The Government is implementing a
comprehensive set of economic policies
designed to improve the underlying rate of
growth and employment, by creating
economic stability based on low inflation and
prudent government borrowing, and by
improving the environment for long-term
investment in industry, education and
training. The Welfare State is being
modernised in order to help people back into
employment (see p. 421). The Government
has launched a comprehensive spending
review (see p. 160) to ensure that spending is
in line with its own priorities and is targeted
efficiently and effectively. It is reviewing the
tax system to make sure that it is
demonstrably fair to all (see p. 162). The
Government is working with business to
improve the competitiveness of companies
through raising investment in infrastructure,
science and technology, and in education and
skills training. It believes that economic
development must take place in a way that is
consistent with high standards of
environmental protection.
HM Treasury is the government
department with prime responsibility for the
formulation and conduct of economic policy,
which it carries out in conjunction with other
government departments, such as Trade and
Industry; Education and Employment; and
the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
Responsibility for the objectives of monetary
policy rests with the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. To ensure that interest rate
decisions are taken in the long-term interests
of the economy, the Government has given
operational responsibility for setting interest
rates to the Bank of England (the central bank,
see p. 235).
ECONOMIC POLICY
Action is being taken by the Government to
bring about price stability and sound public
finances, which will underpin a strengthened
economy. Price stability is seen as a
precondition for high and sustainable levels of
growth and employment. The new monetary
framework is designed to secure permanently
low inflation, which will help to generate
greater business confidence. Under the new
monetary arrangements, the Government sets
the inflation target, and the Bank of England
takes operational decisions on interest rates to
meet the target. Without prejudice to the price
stability objective, the Bank supports the
Government’s economic policy, including its
objectives for growth and employment. The
Government has set the inflation target for
underlying inflation (see p. 155) at 2.5 per
cent. Although short-term interest rates have
been raised in pursuit of the Government’s
inflation target, the reforms giving the Bank of
England operational responsibility for setting
interest rates should lead to lower interest
rates in the long run. Long-term interest rates
and inflation expectations have fallen since the
new monetary arrangements were announced.
156
ECONOMY
Fiscal policy is guided by two overriding
principles: over the economic cycle, the
Government will only borrow to invest, not to
fund current expenditure; and will hold
public debt as a proportion of national income
at a stable and prudent level. These rules
require public borrowing to be kept under
firm control, and mean that current taxpayers
pay for current spending. The Government is
seeking to increase public trust in fiscal policy
by conducting it in a more open and
transparent way (see below).
The main objective of the July 1997
Budget was to put the public finances on a
sound long-term footing. The budget deficit
reduction plan was introduced to ensure the
Government meets its fiscal objectives and to
reverse the rising burden of public debt.
Budget measures to encourage long-term
investment included cuts in corporation tax
(see p. 162), reinvigorating the Private
Finance Initiative (see p. 160) and releasing
local authority capital receipts for
reinvestment (see p. 381). Other measures
were introduced to encourage more balanced
growth (see p. 162).
THE BUDGET
The Budget is the Government’s main
economic statement of the year. In a major
speech to Parliament, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer reviews the nation’s economic
performance and describes the Government’s
economic objectives and the policies it intends
to follow to help achieve them. The Budget
statement also includes details of the taxes the
Government proposes to finance the coming
year’s public spending.
Until March 1993, the Budget was usually
held in the spring and focused mainly on
economic policy and taxation, with the initial
announcement of the Government’s new public
spending plans taking place in November in an
Autumn Statement. From November 1993 to
November 1996, there was a unified Budget
which included announcements on both tax
and spending. Following the May 1997 General
Election, the new Government’s first Budget
was in July 1997. The next Budget is planned
to be in spring 1998.
The Government is seeking greater
openness in the area of public finance, and
has announced action in two areas:
• In May 1997 it asked the National
Audit Office (NAO—see p. 161) to
review some key assumptions in the
public finance forecasts. The NAO’s
report was published before the July
Budget. The NAO will have a
continuing role in auditing the public
finances in future Budgets.
• The Government plans to publish a
consultative paper several months
ahead of each Budget, spelling out the
state of the economy, the progress
made towards the Government’s
economic objectives and the forecast
for the following year; and
encouraging a wide-ranging debate
about the policy action necessary to
ensure that the objectives are
achieved. The first such paper will be
published in November 1997.
Public Finance Strategy
General government expenditure (GGE) is
the total public expenditure by central and
local government. An alternative measure used
is GGE (X) (see Table 11.7), which excludes
privatisation proceeds, spending financed out
of the proceeds of the National Lottery, and
interest and dividend receipts. GGE(X) is
expected to be around £315,300 million in
1997-98 .
The Government’s view is that sound
public finances are essential for economic
stability. In the July 1997 Budget it announced a
five-year plan aimed at reducing the structural
budget deficit (see above). This is supported by
a comprehensive spending review of
government expenditure (see p. 160).
The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
(PSBR) rose rapidly during the early 1990s,
but since then it has fallen and in 1996-97
amounted to £22,700 million, 3 per cent of
GDP. The PSBR is expected to fall
significantly over the period to 1998-99,
primarily as a result of tight control of public
spending.

MAIN PROGRAMMES AND
PRIORITIES
The diagram above shows the main categories
of expenditure, together with the main sources
of revenue.
The government departments with the
largest spending programmes are:
• the Department of Social Security (with
planned expenditure of £79,800 million
in 1997-98, excluding ‘cyclical’ social
security);
• the Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (£44,100
million, of which nearly £31,400 million
is on local government);
• the Department of Health (£34,900
million); and
• the Ministry of Defence (£21,100
million).
Local authorities spend about £76,000
million a year, around a quarter of public
expenditure. The main categories of
expenditure are education, law and order,
personal social services, housing and other
environmental services, and roads and
transport.
July 1997 Budget Measures
The centrepiece of the new Government’s
first Budget is a Welfare-to-Work programme,
which is being financed by a windfall tax on
the excess profits of the privatised utilities (see
p. 162). The programme contains measures to
tackle youth and long-term unemployment
(see p. 173), low levels of employment among
lone parents and rising spending on social
security (see p. 424). Its cost of £5,200 million
includes £3,150 million to help young people
and £350 million for the long-term
unemployed, and £1,300 million for capital
investment in school infrastructure and
technology. The Capital Receipts Initiative is
releasing £900 million to local authorities over
the next two years to boost investment in
housing (see p. 381).
The Government has announced the
allocation of extra resources for its priority
159
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
areas of education and health in 1998-99 from
the Reserve:
• an extra ^1,000 million for local
authorities to spend on education; and
• an additional £ 1,200 million for the
National Health Service.
Comprehensive Spending Review
The Government has instituted a
comprehensive review of government
spending, under which departments are
examining all aspects of central and local
government expenditure. Lasting about a
year, the review will operate at two levels:
• separate departmental reviews are
examining objectives and all aspects of
expenditure with a view to setting new
plans for 1999-2000 and beyond—there
are also a number of cross-departmental
reviews of key policies that cover more
than one department; and
• there will be an examination of the
overall allocation of resources, leading to
a complete set of new departmental
spending plans from 1999-2000 onwards.
In addition, departments are reviewing the
allocation of expenditure within their budgets
for 1997-98 and 1998-99 to reflect the
Government’s priorities.
Private Finance and Public-Private
Partnerships
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI), launched
in 1992, aims to bring the private sector more
directly into the provision of public services.
The public sector specifies the service or
infrastructure needed, and private sector
companies compete to provide these
requirements. By April 1997 some j£7,000
million of projects had been agreed. The
largest single PFI project is the £3,000 million
Channel Tunnel Rail Link (see p. 313). Other
schemes include a number of‘design, build,
finance and operate’ road projects (see p. 305);
the Croydon Tramlink (see p. 313); three new
prisons (see p. 105); a new National Insurance
records system; and a ‘smart card’ system for
the Benefits Agency. ‘Challenge funding’,
under which funding for public sector capital
projects is allocated on a competitive basis, has
also been adopted, notably for urban
regeneration schemes (see p. 372).
The Government sees productive Public-
Private Partnerships as a key factor in the
delivery of high-quality public services. It has
taken steps to make the PFI process more
effective, for example, by abandoning the
requirement for universal testing of projects.
It accepted all 29 of the recommendations of a
review of the PFI process, including the
establishment of a taskforce within HM
Treasury to combine central project and
policy expertise, to confirm the commercial
viability of significant projects and to provide
assistance to departments on these projects.
Legislation has been introduced to tackle
problems which were holding up major
hospital projects, and in July 1997 plans for 14
new hospital schemes, worth £1,300 million,
were announced under the PFI.
CONTROL OF PUBLIC
EXPENDITURE
Public Expenditure Survey
Departmental spending decisions are based on
allocating available resources within agreed
ceilings for aggregate spending, with an
emphasis on obtaining maximum value for
money. Usually, the process of deciding
individual departmental allocations within the
overall target takes place each autumn in the
Public Expenditure Survey, but the 1997
Survey is not taking place as a result of the
decision to conduct the comprehensive
spending review. In the July 1997 Budget the
Government announced that it would stick to
the expenditure ceilings set in the 1996
Budget for 1997-98 and 1998-99.
Estimates
Requests for funds; for the coming financial year
for each government department are presented
to Parliament by HM Treasury. The aim is to
present these Main Supply Estimates before the
end of March. Parliamentary authorisation is
160
ECONOMY
given by the passage of the annual
Appropriation Act. Individual departmental
reports on planned spending are usually
published just prior to presentation of the
Estimates. Supplementary Estimates may be
presented to Parliament during the course of the
year to reflect any necessary changes to the
original Main Estimate.
In each parliamentary session, up to three
‘Estimates days’ are available for debates on
the Supply Estimates, following scrutiny by
select committees of the House of Commons.
If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the
excess will appear in the department’s
appropriation accounts and will be reported
on to the Public Accounts Committee (see
below) by the Comptroller and Auditor
General. Subject to this report, the necessary
provision is sought in an Excess Vote.
Cash Limits
The Government establishes cash limits on just
over 60 per cent of Supply expenditure—
expenditure financed out of money voted by
Parliament in the Supply Estimates. The
imposition of cash limits indicates that the
Government intends to avoid extra provision
for programmes even in the event of
unexpected increases in costs. In such
circumstances the Government will seek to re¬
order priorities or take offsetting action so that
the cash limit is not exceeded, or a
corresponding reduction will be made in
another cash limit.
Expenditure not subject to a cash limit
mainly finances demand-led services like some
Department of Social Security benefits. In such
cases, once policy and rates of payment are
determined, expenditure depends on factors
beyond the direct control of government—such
as the number of eligible recipients and
demographic factors. However, the
Government still seeks to offset or minimise
any non-cash-limited increases, in some cases
by a reduction in cash-limited expenditure.
Changes in Government Accounting
Procedures
Cash-based government accounts are being
replaced by more commercial ‘resource
accounting’ and budgeting methods, a process
initially adopted in executive agencies and the
National Health Service. Resource accounting
took effect for most departments in April 1997
and will be extended to other departments in
April 1998.
The new system is designed to bring
improved efficiency and focus more on
departmental objectives and outputs in terms
of resources used rather than the money
available for spending. Full information about
the assets and liabilities of departments will
become available from the resource accounts
for 1998—99 onwards. All departments are
compiling an asset register, to ensure the
efficient use of government assets.
Examination and Audit of Public
Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons. These study in detail the activities
of particular government departments and
cross-examine ministers and officials.
The Public Accounts Committee considers
the accounts of government departments,
executive agencies and other public sector
bodies, and reports by the Comptroller and
Auditor General on departments and their use
of resources. It submits reports to Parliament.
Audit of the Government’s spending is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of
the National Audit Office. The NAO’s
responsibilities include certifying the accounts
of all government departments and executive
agencies and those of a wide range of other
public sector bodies; scrutinising the
economy, efficiency and effectiveness of their
operations; examining revenue accounts and
inventories; and reporting the results of these
examinations to Parliament.
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue
tax;
161
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• taxes on capital, which include
inheritance tax, capital gains tax, council
tax and non-domestic rates;
• taxes oft expenditure, which include
VAT (value added tax) and customs and
excise duties; and
• National Insurance contributions, which
give entitlement to a range of benefits,
including the Retirement Pension and
Jobseeker’s Allowance (see chapter 25).
Taxation Policy
The Government intends to develop a tax
system that reflects, and is underpinned by,
the following key principles:
• encouraging employment opportunities
and work incentives for everyone;
• promoting savings and long-term
investment;
• fairness; and
• a system which is seen to be fair.
Tax Measures in the 1997 Budget
The main tax changes in the Budget in July
1997 were:
• a windfall tax (see below) to provide the
finance for the new Welfare-to-Work
programme (seep. 173);
• measures to encourage long-term
investment, including cuts in the main
rate of corporation tax from 33 to 31 per
cent and in the rate for small businesses
from 23 to 21 per cent, both taking effect
from April 1997, and abolition of
payments of tax credits to pension
schemes and British companies;
• measures for moving towards a fairer tax
system—a reduction in the rate of VAT
on fuel and power from 8 to 5 per cent,
from September 1997, which will be
financed by the abolition of tax relief on
premiums for private medical insurance
for those aged over 60 and a package of
measures to tackle tax avoidance;
• measures to protect the environment and
health; and
• measures to promote economic
stability—a reduction in mortgage
interest tax relief from 15 to 10 per cent,
and an increase in the rate of stamp duty
on transfers of property above £250,000.
Windfall Tax
The windfall tax is a one-off tax on the excess
profits of the privatised utilities, payable in
two instalments, in December 1997 and
December 1998. The tax will apply to
companies privatised by flotation and
regulated by statute. It will be charged at a
rate of 23 per cent on the difference between a
company’s value at flotation and the value
calculated by. reference to profits over a period
of up to four years following privatisation.
The tax is expected to yield £5,200 million:
• around £2,100 million from the
electricity sector;
• £1,650 million from the water industry;
and
• £1,450 million from other companies:
BAA, the successor companies to British
Gas (BG and Centrica), BT and
Railtrack.
Encouraging Long-term Investment
Changes to corporate taxation are designed to
create a climate for long-term investment, and
the cuts in the rates of corporation tax will
enhance Britain’s position as having the lowest
corporate tax rate of a major industrialised
country. Abolishing payment of tax credits to
pension schemes and British companies is
intended to remove a major distortion in the
tax system. Other shareholders will generally
not be affected by changes to tax credits until
April 1999 when the rate of tax credits will
halve to 10 per cent and tax credits will
normally no longer be payable to other
shareholders with no tax liability.
The change in April 1999 is designed to fit in
with the introduction of the ‘individual savings
account’ (ISA). This will extend the principles
of TESSAs (Tax Exempt Special Savings
Accounts) and PEPs (Personal Equity Plans)
(see p. 244) to encourage people, through tax
162
ECONOMY
reliefs, to raise the level of their long-term
savings. It will have a particular emphasis on
encouraging those on low incomes to save.
Protecting the Environment and Health
The Government places a high priority on the
use of the tax system to deliver its
environmental objectives (see chapter 21). In
line with these objectives, it is introducing
higher duties on road fuel and tobacco:
• road fuel duties will now rise by 6 per
cent a year in real terms; and
• tobacco duties will go up by at least 5 per
cent a year in real terms.
From 1998 a lower level of vehicle excise
duty will be applied to lorries and buses meeting
low emission standards. The Government is
also considering the case for environmental
taxes on the extraction of aggregates and other
quarrying (which will be examined in
conjunction with an assessment of the landfill
tax—see p. 166) and on water pollution.
Tax and Benefit Reform
In May 1997 the Government established a
taskforce to consider streamlining and
modernising the tax and benefit system in
order to help increase employment
opportunities and work incentives, reduce
poverty and welfare dependency, and
strengthen community and family life.
Tax Policy Reviews
A number of tax policy reviews are in
progress, including reviews of:
• North Sea taxation;
• capital gains taxation;
• taxation on charities;
• anti-avoidance—leakage and avoidance of
direct taxes; and
• alcohol and tobacco duties.
Collection of Taxes and Duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects
taxes on income, profits and capital, and
stamp duty. HM Customs and Excise collects
the most important taxes on expenditure
(VAT and most duties). Vehicle excise duty is
the responsibility of the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions.
National Insurance contributions are the
responsibility of the Department of Social
Security, although they are mainly collected
by the Inland Revenue. The main local
taxes—council tax and non-domestic rates
(see p. 167)—are collected by local authorities.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Taxes on individual incomes are generally
progressive in that larger incomes are subject to
a greater amount of tax. Income tax is imposed
for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April.
The tax rates and bands for 1996-97 and
1997-98 are shown in Table 11.9 and apply to
total income, including earned and investment
income. The Government has announced that
it will not raise the basic and upper rates of
income tax—23 and 40 per cent respectively—
in the current Parliament. It has also
announced its long-term objective of
introducing a lower starting rate of tax of 10 per
cent. Of nearly 26 million income taxpayers,
around 7.2 million are expected to pay only
lower rate tax in 1997-98, about 16.2 million
will be basic rate taxpayers and 2.2 million will
be in the higher rate tax band.
Allowances and reliefs reduce an individual’s
income tax liability, and the main allowances are
shown in Table 11.9. All taxpayers are entitled
to a personal allowance against income from all
sources. In addition, there is a married couple’s
allowance, which may be allocated to either
partner, or they may receive half each. Wives
have the right to receive half the allowance. Tax
relief for some allowances, including the married
couple’s allowance, is restricted to 15 per cent.
Among the most important reliefs is that
for mortgage interest payments on borrowing
for house purchase up to a limit of £30,000.
Relief, which is limited to 15 per cent (10 per
cent from April 1998), is usually given ‘at
source’, that is, repayments which the
borrower makes to the lender are reduced to
take account of tax relief and the tax refund is
passed directly by the tax authorities to the

lender rather than to the individual borrower.
Employees’ contributions to their pension
schemes also qualify for tax relief.
In general, income tax is charged on all
income which originates in Britain—although
some forms of income are exempt, such as
child benefit—and on all income arising
abroad of people resident in Britain. Britain
has entered into agreements with many
countries to provide relief from double
taxation; where such agreements are not in
force, unilateral relief is often allowed. British
residents working abroad for the whole year
may benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)
system whereby tax is deducted and accounted
for to the Inland Revenue by the employer, in
a way which enables most employees to pay
the correct amount of tax during the year.
A new self-assessment system for collecting
personal taxation has been introduced. The
first ‘new style’ tax returns were sent out in
April 1997 to around 8 million people who
regularly complete a tax return—primarily
higher-rate taxpayers, the self-employed and
those receiving investment income
(particularly where this is paid without tax
being deducted). Taxpayers are now able to
calculate their own tax liability, although they
can choose to have the calculations done by
the Inland Revenue. There is a new legal
requirement to keep records of income and
capital gains from all sources.
Corporation Tax
The rates of company tax in Britain are lower
than in most other industrialised countries.
Companies pay corporation tax on their income
and capital gains after deduction of certain
allowances and reliefs. A company which
distributes profits to its shareholders is
required to pay advance corporation tax (ACT)
on these distributions to the Inland Revenue.
ACT is set against the company’s liability to
corporation tax, subject to a limit. Shareholders
(except pension schemes and companies)
resident in Britain receiving distributions from
British-resident companies are treated as
having some or all of their liability to income
tax satisfied for such income.
The main rate of corporation tax is 31 per
cent, with a reduced rate of 21 per cent for
164
ECONOMY
small companies (those with profits below
£300,000 in a year). Relief is allowed for
companies with profits between £300,000 and
£1.5 million, so that the company’s overall rate
is between the main rate and the small
companies’ rate. Some capital expenditure may
qualify for relief in the form of capital
allowances. Examples include expenditure on
machinery and plant, industrial buildings,
agricultural buildings and scientific research.
Expenditure on machinery or plant by small or
medium-sized businesses qualifies for a first-
year allowance, normally of 50 per cent if
expenditure is incurred in the year to July 1998.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax (PRT), deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax, is
charged on profits from the production—as
opposed, for example, to the refining—of oil
and gas in Britain and on its Continental Shelf
under licence from the Department of Trade
and Industry. Each licensee of an oilfield or
gasfield is charged at a rate of 50 per cent on
the profits from that field after deduction of
certain allowances and reliefs. New fields
given consent for development on or after 16
March 1993 and gas from certain fields sold
under contracts negotiated before 1975 are not
liable to PRT.
Taxes on Capital
Taxes on capital include capital gains tax
(CGT) and inheritance tax. A review of CGT
is in progress, partly with the aim of
examining the case for measures to encourage
long-term holding of assets. It is expected to
be completed in time for any changes to be
announced in the 1998 Budget.
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains tax is payable by individuals and
trusts on gains realised from the disposal of
assets. It is payable on the amount by which
total chargeable gains for a year exceed the
exempt amount (£6,500 for individuals and
£3,250 for trusts in 1997-98). For individuals,
CGT is calculated at income tax rates, as if the
amount were additional taxable income, while
there are special rates for trusts. Only gains
arising since 1982 are subject to tax.
Indexation relief is given to take account of the
effects of inflation. Gains on some types of
asset are exempt from CGT. These include
the principal private residence, government
securities, certain corporate bonds, and gains
on shares and corporate bonds owned under
PEPs.
For companies capital gains are charged to
corporation tax, although there is no annual
exempt amount.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is essentially charged on
estates at the time of death and on gifts made
within seven years of death; most other
lifetime transfers are not taxed. There are
several important exemptions. Generally,
transfers between spouses are exempt, and
gifts and bequests to British charities, major
political parties and heritage bodies are also
normally exempt. In general, business assets
and farmland are exempt from inheritance tax,
so that most family businesses can be passed
on without a tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40 per
cent above a threshold, currently £215,000.
Only about 2 per cent of estates a year become
liable for an inheritance tax bill.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax
VAT is a broadly based expenditure tax, with
a standard rate of 17.5 per cent and a reduced
rate of 5 per cent on domestic fuel and power.
It is collected at each stage in the production
and distribution of goods and services by
taxable persons. The final tax is payable by the
consumer.
The annual level of turnover above which
traders must register for VAT is £48,000
(£49,000 from December 1997). Certain
goods and services are relieved from VAT,
either by being charged at a zero rate or by
being exempt.
• Under zero rating, a taxable person does
not charge tax to a customer but reclaims
165
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
any input tax paid to suppliers. Among
the main categories where zero-rating
applies are goods exported to other
countries; most food; water and sewerage
for non-business use; domestic and
international passenger transport; books,
newspapers and periodicals; construction
of new residential buildings; young
children’s clothing and footwear; drugs
and medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people;
and certain supplies by or to charities.
• For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge any output tax
but is not entitled to reclaim the input
tax. The main categories where
exemption applies are many supplies of
land and buildings; insurance and other
financial services; postal services; betting;
gaming (with certain important
exceptions); lotteries; much education
and training; and health and welfare.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the EU in accordance with its
Common Customs Tariff. Goods can move
freely across internal EU frontiers without
making customs entries at importation or
stopping for routine fiscal checks. For
commercial consignments, excise duty and
VAT are charged in the member state of
destination, at the rate in force in that state.
Excise Duties
Mineral oils used as road fuel are subject to
higher rates of duty than those used for other
purposes, although there are reduced rates to
encourage the use of more environmentally
friendly fuels, such as unleaded petrol, ultra
low sulphur diesel, and gas used as road fuel.
Kerosene not used as road fuel, most
lubricating oils and oils used for certain
industrial, horticultural and marine uses are
free of duty. Fuel substitutes are taxed at the
same rate as the corresponding mineral oil.
There are duties on spirits, beer, wine, made-
wine (wine with added constituents, such as
fruit juice), cider and perry, charged according
to alcoholic strength and volume. Spirits used
for scientific, medical, research and industrial
processes are generally free of duty. Cigarette
duty is charged partly as a cash amount per
cigarette and partly as a percentage of retail
price. Duty on other tobacco products is based
on weight.
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
amusement machines. Rates vary with the
particular form of gambling. Duty is levied
either as a percentage of gross or net stakes or,
in the case of amusement machines, as a fixed
amount per machine according to the cost of
playing and the prize level. On the National
Lottery (see pp. 47-8) there is a 12 per cent
duty on gross stakes, but no tax on winnings.
Annual vehicle excise duty (VED) on a
privately owned motor car, light van or taxi
with fewer than nine seats will rise by £5 to
£150 for licences taken out after 15 November
1997. The duty on goods vehicles is levied on
the basis of gross weight and, if over 12
tonnes, according to the number of axles; it is
designed to ensure that such vehicles at least
cover their share of the full costs of road use
through the tax paid (VED and fuel duty).
Duty on taxis and buses varies according to
seating capacity, and duty on motorcycles
according to engine capacity. Privately owned
vehicles over 25 years old—cars, taxis,
motorcycles and non-commercial vehicles—
are exempt from VED. A review of VED is in
progress in connection with the development
of the Government’s integrated transport
policy (see p. 304).
Other taxes include:
• insurance premium tax chargeable at 4
per cent on all types of taxable insurance
risk in Britain (unless specifically
exempted) or at 17.5 per cent on certain
premiums charged in relation to the sale
or hire of relevant goods and services;
• air passenger duty of £5 for flights to
internal destinations and to those in the
European Economic Area and £10
elsewhere (£10 and £20 respectively
from 1 November 1997); and
• a landfill tax of £2 a tonne on inactive
waste (such as bricks) which does not
166
ECONOMY
decay or contaminate land, and £1 a
tonne on other waste.
Stamp Duty
Certain kinds of transfer are subject to stamp
duty. Transfers of shares attract duty at 0.5
per cent of the cost, while certain instruments,
such as declarations of trust, have small fixed
duties of 50p or ^1. Transfers by gift and
transfers to charities are exempt. The July
1997 Budget raised the rate of stamp duty on
the transfers of property (except shares) over
£250,000, in order to encourage stability in
the housing market. Duty is now payable at 1
per cent of the total price above £60,000, 1.5
per cent for property above £250,000 and 2
per cent for property where the price exceeds
£500,000.
Other Revenue
National Insurance Contributions
There are five classes of National Insurance
contribution:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers;
• Class 1A—paid by employers on the cash
equivalent of the benefit of cars and fuel
provided to their employees for private
use;
• Class 2—paid by the self-employed;
• Class 3—paid voluntarily for pension
purposes; and
• Class 4—paid by self-employed people
on their taxable profits between £7,010
and £24,180 a year (in addition to their
Class 2 contribution).
Details of the rates of contribution are
given in chapter 25 on pp. 423-4.
Local Authority Revenue
Local authorities in Great Britain have four
main sources of revenue income: grants from
central government; council tax; non-domestic
rates (sometimes known as business rates); and
sales, fees and charges. About 80 per cent of
expenditure (excluding sales, fees and charges)
is financed by government grants and
redistributed non-domestic rates.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value of property is assessed by
reference to annual rents and reviewed every
five years. The non-domestic rate is set
nationally by central government and collected
by local authorities. It is paid into a national
pool and redistributed to local authorities in
proportion to their population.
Domestic property in Great Britain is
generally subject to the council tax. Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
bands, based on its capital value (the amount it
might have sold for on the open market) in
April 1991. Discounts are available for
dwellings with fewer than two resident adults,
and those on low incomes may receive council
tax benefit of up to 100 per cent of the tax bill
(see p. 432).
In Northern Ireland, rates—local domestic
property taxes based on the value of the
property—are collected by local authorities.
GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL
OPERATIONS
Debt Management
The Government funds its borrowing
requirement by selling debt to the private
sector. There has been a steady increase in
government debt during the 1990s, and in
1996-97 net public sector debt was £350,000
million, 45 per cent of GDP, as against 27 per
cent in 1990—91. From 1997—98 the burden of
debt is expected to fall as government
borrowing declines substantially.
The funding requirement for 1997-98 is
forecast to be about £28,100 million, of which
National Savings products (see p. 240) are
assumed to contribute about £3,000 million,
with gilt-edged stock contributing the balance.
Gilt-edged Stock
The major debt instrument, government
bonds, is known as gilt-edged stock (‘gilts’) as
there is no risk of default. Gilts are marketable
and widely traded; holdings of gilts total over
167
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Among the criteria for participating in the
single currency under the Maastricht
Treaty (see p. 125) are reference values for
a government’s financial deficit and its
debt. Britain expects to meet both these
criteria in 1997, with the general
government financial deficit forecast to be
2 per cent of GDP, compared with the
reference value of 3 per cent, while the
gross public sector debt ratio (which is
expected to have peaked at nearly 55 per
cent of GDP in 1996-97) is forecast to be
below the Maastricht level of 60 per cent.
£270,000 million. Pension funds and life
insurance companies have the largest holdings.
The Government publishes an annual debt
management report which sets out the
framework for issuing gilts in the coming year.
Gilts are currently sold by the Bank of
England on the Government’s behalf. Under
the proposed reforms of the Bank (see p. 235),
this role will be transferred to the Treasury in
1998:
Gilt issues are primarily by auction
(broadly monthly), supplemented by ad hoc
‘tap’ sales. Gilts include ‘conventionals’,
which pay fixed rates of interest and
redemption sums; index-linked stocks, on
which principal and interest are linked to
movements in the Retail Prices Index; and
floating-rate gilts, with payments linked to
short-term interest rates. A series of changes
has been implemented to increase the
efficiency and liquidity of the gilts market, so
enhancing the overall efficiency of Britain’s
financial system. Among these was a new open
sale and repurchase (‘repo’) market in gilts,
launched in 1996, while a market for gilt
‘strips’ will start in December 1997.
Bills
Sterling Treasury bills are sold at a weekly
tender; the majority have a maturity of three
months. These are used to manage the money
markets and meet the weekly cash needs of
the Government, rather than to meet its
annual borrowing needs. The Government
also issues bills denominated in European
Currency Units (ECUs).1 The proceeds are
added to the official foreign exchange reserves
rather than being used to finance public
expenditure.
1 The ECU is a composite currency consisting of specified
amounts of each EU currency.

The labour market in Britain has undergone major changes in recent years,
notably with more women in the workforce, increased levels of part-time working
and the continuing move towards employment in service industries. Over three-
quarters of employees now work in the service sector, compared with less than
one-fifth in manufacturing. With the growth in economic activity,
unemployment has fallen since the end of 1992, although it remains above the
long-term average. The Government’s policy is focusing on the need for a skilled,
trained and adaptable labour force and flexible labour market, supported by
minimum standards of fairness and decency. Health and safety at work has
improved, with fatalities from accidents at work at a historically low level.
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
There were 28.8 million people classed as
economically active in Britain in spring 1997.
The number in employment totalled 26.8
million (see Table 12.1), of whom 23.1 million
(12.1 million men and 11 million women) were
classed as employees. Employment is growing
again following a decline during the recession
of the early 1990s, but remains below the pre¬
recession peak in spring 1990. Since winter
1992—93 (the most recent employment trough)
employment in Great Britain has grown by
almost 1.2 million.
Two main long-term trends have been the
growing number of women in the workforce
and the move from full-time to part-time jobs
(see charts on p. 171):
• Women now comprise 44 per cent of all
those in employment in Britain, and a
higher proportion of employees (47 per
cent) than of the self-employed (25 per
cent).
• Since 1987 part-time employment in
Great Britain has risen by 24 per cent, to
over 6.5 million in summer 1997: nearly
5.3 million women and almost 1.3 million
men. About 45 per cent of women were
working part-time, compared with 9 per
cent of men.
About 1.2 million people in Great Britain
in spring 1997 had two or more jobs, while
around 1.8 million were engaged in temporary
jobs. The main reason for people working in
temporary jobs is that they cannot find a
permanent one, although a significant number
prefer a temporary job. Temporary workers
included 861,000 on fixed-period contracts,
332,000 on casual work and 227,000 doing
temporary work for an employment agency.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
There has been considerable interest in
Britain recently in labour market statistics.
In May 1997, the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) initiated wide public
consultation on how these statistics should
be presented in future. The consultation
revealed that most people supported
ONS’s plans:
• to provide a more coherent and
rounded picture of the labour market
by publishing statistics in an integrated
format;
• to give greater prominence to data
from the Labour Force Survey (LFS),
whose estimate of those unemployed
is in line with the International
Labour Organisation’s definition; and
• in addition to unemployment data, to
provide statistics on those who are not
unemployed as such, but are
economically inactive and would like a
job.
Contracting out by firms of specialist and non¬
core functions has increased. ‘Teleworking’—
people working from home using information
technology—is also becoming more
widespread, for example, in journalism,
consultancy and computer programming.
Over 3.3 million people are self-employed
in Britain, 7 per cent more than in 1987 but
below the peak level in 1990. Agriculture and
fishing, and construction have the highest
proportions of self-employed people, while
relatively few of those engaged in
manufacturing and public administration are
self-employed. Around 17 per cent of men and
7 per cent of women in employment are self-
employed.
Occupational Changes
There has been a gradual move away from
manual to non-manual occupations, which are
now held by 61 per cent of people in
employment in Great Britain. Over half of
non-manual workers are women. Self-
employment is highest in craft and related
occupations (28 per cent of self-employed in
Great Britain in spring 1997), followed by
managers and administrators (24 per cent).
Employment by Sector
As in other industrialised countries, there has
been a marked shift in jobs from
manufacturing to service industries (see Table
12.2). In the last 40 years the proportion of
employees in employment engaged in service
industries has more than doubled, to 76 per
cent. In June 1997 there were 16.8 million
employees in the service sector in Great
Britain, about 2.3 million more than in 1987
(see Table 12.3). Business activities,
distribution, hotels and restaurants, education,
medical services and social work experienced
significant increases. Some new services, such
as call centres, have developed. Not all
services have grown, with employment having
fallen in areas such as the Civil Service,
defence and retail banking.

Most other sectors—manufacturing,
construction, agriculture, and mining, energy
and water supply—have experienced lower
levels of employment. Traditional
manufacturing industries, such as steel and
shipbuilding, have recorded particularly large
falls in employment, while employment in
mining, energy and water supply has fallen by
38 per cent in the 1990s. By 1997
manufacturing accounted for 18 per cent of
employees in employment, compared with 42
per cent in 1955. In June 1997 employment in
the main manufacturing sectors in Great
Britain included:
• 712,000 employees in non-metallic
mineral products, metal and metal
products;
• 493,000 in electrical and optical
equipment;
• 461,000 in paper, pulp, printing,
publishing and recording media;
• 430,000 in food products, beverages and
tobacco; and
• 361,000 in clothing, textiles, leather and
leather products.
Unemployment
Unemployment in Britain has fallen
considerably since the peak at the end of 1992,
and is now lower than in many other
European countries. However, it remains
above the levels which prevailed during the
post-war years up to the end of the 1970s. The
level of unemployment in summer 1997 was
just under 2 million in Great Britain,
according to the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) definition of
unemployment, measured by the LFS. There
were 1.6 million people claiming Jobseeker’s
Allowance in Britain in June 1997.
Although there is a significant difference,
both measures show a downward trend in
unemployment. ILO unemployment has
declined in all regions—in summer 1997 it
ranged from 5.1 per cent in the South East
(outside London) to 10.4 per cent in
Merseyside. However, over 690,000 people in
Great Britain in summer 1997 had been
unemployed for more than a year, and the
unemployment rate for those under 25 is
almost double the overall rate of
unemployment. In addition, the LFS
172
EMPLOYMENT
identified around 2.5 million people classed as
economically inactive who say that they would
like a job.
LABOUR MARKET POLICY
There are four key aspects to the
Government’s labour market policies: the
Welfare-to-Work programme, education and
training, a national minimum wage and its
employability initiative.
Welfare-to-Work
The Government’s Welfare-to-Work
programme is a series of measures designed to
tackle youth and long-term unemployment,
promote employability and develop skills, and
move people from welfare into jobs. The
programme is being funded by a windfall tax
on the excess profits of the privatised utilities
(see p. 162). Some £5,200 million will be
invested in the programme, in a number of
‘New Deals’ including:
• £3,150 million for young people;
• £350 million for the long-term
unemployed;
• £200 million for lone parents;
• £1,300 million for schools; and
• £200 million for people with disabilities.
Young Unemployed
From January 1998 in 13 ‘pathfinder’ areas
and from April 1998 nationally, the New Deal
for young people will help those under 25 who
have been unemployed for more than six
months through four options:
• a job attracting a wage subsidy of £60 a
week, payable to employers for up to six
months;
• a work placement with a voluntary
organisation;
• a six-month work placement with a new
Environmental Task Force; and
• for those without basic qualifications, a
place on a full-time education and training
course, which might last for up to one year.
All the options will include an element of
training. For each young person the programme
will start with a ‘Gateway’ period of careers
advice and intensive help with looking for work,
and with training in the skills needed for the
world of work. The programme is expected to
help around 250,000 people.
Long-term Unemployed
The New Deal for the long-term unemployed
will start in June 1998 when employers will
receive a subsidy of £75 a week for six months
if they employ anyone who has been
unemployed for two years or longer.
Other Groups
The New Deal for Lone Parents will provide
job search help, advice and training for lone
parents whose youngest child is aged over five,
and will be accompanied by measures to
increase the supply of, and help with, childcare.
In addition, the Government is developing
proposals to help those who are disabled or on
incapacity benefit who want training or work.
Education and Training
The Government has described education and
training as its top priorities. It considers that
they are central to ensuring that Britain meets
the requirements of the rapidly changing
world economy, and that the workforce has
the necessary skills to adapt to the new
opportunities. Its measures on education (see
chapter 26) and on training are designed to
help achieve high and stable levels of
economic growth and employment.
Government proposals to improve training
and to increase participation in training by
both individuals and employers will be
contained in a White Paper to be issued in
autumn 1997.
Young People
The Government plans to ensure that all
young people will have access to high-quality
education and training. It intends to replace
Youth Training (see p. 176) with a new
173
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
programme, Target 2000. Young people will
have two routes after 16: one based on school
and college education, and a work-based route
covering apprenticeship and training. In
addition, under the Welfare-to-Work
programme (see above) all young unemployed
people will be guaranteed education and
training opportunities, while those with poor
basic skills will have the option of participating
in full-time study on an approved course.
Lifelong Learning
To encourage individuals to invest in training
and so maintain and enhance their skills, the
Government is planning a number of
measures, including Individual Learning
Accounts and a new University for Industry
(see chapter 26, p. 454).
Minimum Wage
The Government plans to introduce
legislation for a statutory national minimum
wage; all other modern industrialised
countries have some form of comprehensive
minimum wage-fixing machinery. The
minimum wage is intended to remove the
worst excesses of exploitation of low-paid
workers and ensure greater fairness in the
workplace. Sectors likely to be affected
include those, such as retailing, catering and
hairdressing, where there used to be wages
councils setting statutory minimum pay.
An independent Low Pay Commission will
recommend to the Government the level at
which the national minimum wage might
initially be set. Before making its
recommendation, the Commission will
undertake a wide-ranging consultation exercise,
and take evidence on the issues surrounding the
introduction of the national minimum wage.
The Government will then set the level of the
minimum wage, taking into account the
prevailing economic circumstances.
Employability Initiative and Other
International Aspects
The Government has announced that Britain
will now play a full part in the direction of
social affairs in Europe. Accordingly, it has
ended Britain’s opt-out from the European
Union (EU) Agreement on Social Policy (the
social chapter—see p. 127). Two measures
have so far been adopted under the social
chapter: directives on European works
councils (see p. 182) and parental leave.
Detailed arrangements for applying these two
measures to Britain have still to be agreed, but
the Government has undertaken to implement
both directives within two years.
‘Employability’ will be an important theme
when Britain holds the EU’s presidency in the
first half of 1998. In October 1997 the
Chancellor of the Exchequer launched a
British employment action plan to tackle
British and European employment problems.
The plan is part of the ‘Getting Europe Back
to Work’-initiative and calls on the EU to
focus its efforts in five broad areas:
• promoting economic growth and
stability;
investing in human capital;
helping people from welfare into work;
improving the workings of markets; and
through these and other actions, creating
a fair and inclusive society.
The Chancellor will also host a special G8
conference in Britain in 1998 when
employability will be a key subject.
TRAINING, EDUCATION AND
ENTERPRISE
According to the Labour Force Survey in
spring 1997, nearly 3.2 million people received
job-related training in the previous four
weeks, 14 per cent of employees of working
age. Training is highest for young workers,
especially those between 16 and 24. Around 84
per cent of medium and large establishments
provide off-the-job training for their
employees.
Current government-supported training
programmes are described in this section; a
number of these are being reviewed.
National Training Organisations
A new network of National Training
Organisations (NTOs) is gradually replacing
industry training organisations, ‘lead bodies’
174
EMPLOYMENT
and occupational standards councils. The
NTOs act as the focal point for training
matters in their particular sector of industry,
commerce or public service. Their role is to
ensure that the skills needs of their sectors are
being met and that occupational standards are
being established and maintained for key
occupations. There are 37 NTOs, covering
sectors employing about 63 per cent of the
workforce.
Training and Enterprise Councils
There are 79 Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) in England and Wales.
These are independent companies with
employer-led boards. Their objective is to
foster local economic development and
stimulate employer investment in skills—in
particular through the Investors in People
standard (see below)—within their area. Their
special focus is to strengthen the skills base
and assist local training and enterprise
programmes which are funded by the
Government. They are also lead partners in
many of the projects funded through the
Single Regeneration Budget (see p. 371).
TECs are developing a new system of
training inspection, to be introduced in April
1998, for publicly funded training
qualifications, such as Modern
Apprenticeships (see p. 176). They will also
have an important role in the delivery of the
New Deals for the unemployed (see p. 173).
TECs are accountable to the Government
through their contracts. The Government
Offices for the Regions are responsible for
managing and overseeing the overall
government contract with TECs.
Local Enterprise Companies
A separate network of 22 Local Enterprise
Companies (LECs) exists in Scotland. These
have wider-ranging responsibilities than the
TECs, covering economic development and
environmental improvement. LECs are also
responsible for the delivery of the
Government’s national training programmes
in Scotland but, unlike TECs, have no
responsibility for work-related further
education. They run under contract to two
non-departmental public bodies: Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise (see p. 197).
National Targets for Education and
Training
The National Targets for Education and
Training were launched by the Confederation
of British Industry in 1991 and are supported
by the Government and many national and
local organisations, including NTOs, TECs
and LECs, and other major education,
training and employer bodies. The Targets
aim to improve Britain’s international
competitiveness by raising standards and
attainment levels in education and training.
The Targets, which relate to the end of the
year 2000, cover both young people and the
workforce as a whole. (For further details, see
chapter 26, p. 450).
Investors in People
The Investors in People standard, introduced
in 1991, provides a framework for employers
to support their investment in people. It helps
companies to improve their performance by
linking the training and development of all
employees directly to the achievement of
business objectives. TECs and LECs provide
advice and information to help organisations
to work towards the standard.
Over 28,000 organisations, employing some
30 per cent of the. workforce, have made a
commitment to work towards the Investors in
People standard. By mid-1997 more than
7,150 organisations had achieved the standard.
Reported benefits include increased
productivity, higher profits, lower rates of
sickness and absenteeism, and improved
morale. The Government is committed to
making Investors in People the general
standard across all British employers. It is
looking particularly to see many more small
businesses work towards the standard.
Training for Work
The Training for Work programme is
designed to help unemployed and
175
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
disadvantaged adults to find jobs through
training and work experience. The
programme is open to those aged 18 to 63 who
have been unemployed for six months or
longer, although some groups with special
needs can join earlier. Training is carried out
by training providers under contract with the
local TEC or LEG. Each new trainee receives
an individually adapted package of training
and/or structured work activities.
National Training Awards
The National Training Awards are an annual
competition designed to promote good
training practice by example, rewarding those
who have carried out exceptionally effective
training. The competition was revised in 1997
to concentrate more on training by employers.
In 1997, 92 awards were presented to national
winners, who were selected from about 880
entrants.
Career Development Loans
Career development loans are available to help
people to pay for vocational education or
training in Great Britain. Loans of between
£200 and £8,000 are provided through four
major banks, and interest payments on the
loans during training and for one month after
training are funded by the Department for
Education and Employment. The loans help
to pay for courses lasting up to two years.
More than 87,000 people have borrowed over
£266 million through the programme since
1988 to pay for training.
Small Firms Training
The Small Firms Training Loans programme
helps firms with 50 or fewer employees to
meet a range of training-related expenses,
including training consultancy. Loans of
between £500 and £125,000 are available
through seven major banks, and repayments
can be deferred for up to 12 months.
Skills for Small Businesses is designed to
help companies by training selected key
workers—one per company-—who then pass
on their knowledge and expertise to other
employees. Over 13,000 firms have
participated in the programme since its launch
in April 1995.
Improving the Training Market
The Improving the Training Market
programme covers a range of activities funded
by the Department for Education and
Employment aimed at improving the quality,
impact and cost-effectiveness of vocational
education and training. Priority is being given
to encouraging investment by individuals in
learning, and supporting the implementation
of new qualifications.
Training for Young People
The objectives of the two main youth
programmes—Modern Apprenticeships and
Youth Training—are to:
• provide participants with training leading
to vocational qualifications at National
Vocational Qualification/Scottish
Vocational Qualification (NVQ/SVQ)
levels 2 and 3 or above and with the
broad-based skills necessary to become
flexible and self-reliant employees; and
• meet the skill needs of the national and
local economies.
The delivery of training is arranged through
TECs and LECs. In Scotland, training for
young people is arranged through the
Skillseekers scheme.
Youth Training is due to be replaced by a
new programme, Target 2000 (see p. 174).
Meanwhile, new National Traineeships for
training to NVQ^levels 1 and 2, which will
draw on the best features of the current
arrangements, were phased in from September
1997 and will play an important part in Target
2000. They will offer a broad and flexible
learning programme, including the key skills
of communication, numeracy and information
technology.
Modern Apprenticeships, which became fully
operational in 1995, are designed to increase
significantly the number of young people
trained to technician, supervisory and
equivalent levels. More than 100,000 young
176
EMPLOYMENT
people have begun Modern Apprenticeships,
which are in operation in over 70 industry
sectors. Evaluation studies have found that
Modern Apprenticeships are of high quality,
are very popular and have met the expectations
of both employers and young people.
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development, has primary
responsibility for training and employment
services. It aims to assist economic
development and help people to find work
through training and employment services
delivered on the basis of equality of
opportunity.
The Agency has encouraged the formation
of a sector training council in each of the main
sectors to advise on employers’ training needs
and develop sectoral training strategies. In
addition, the Agency supports company
training through its Company Development
Programme and encourages management
development by providing training
programmes and seminars.
Northern Ireland has its own range of
training and employment programmes for
people seeking work. Its Jobskills programme
is designed to raise skill levels—and is linked
to the attainment of NVQs—and to enhance
the employment prospects of school-leavers
and unemployed adults. About 15,000 places
are available in 1997—98. In order to combat
the relatively high level of long-term
unemployment in Northern Ireland, the
Agency is spending £28.5 million in 1997-98
on its Action for Community Employment
Scheme, a pilot Community Work
Programme and on Enterprise Ulster (a
statutory organisation which provides
employment, training and work experience for
adults, especially those aged 18 to 25 who have
been unemployed for over three months). The
Agency is reviewing its programmes in the
light of the Welfare-to-Work programme.
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
There are a variety of ways in which people
find jobs. According to the Labour Force
Survey in spring 1996, the main methods
were:
• replying to advertisements in the
national, local and specialist press (33 per
cent), with a further 10 per cent
answering other advertisements;
• visiting a Jobcentre or employment
agency office (29 per cent);
• personal contacts (12 per cent); and
• direct approaches to employers (10 per
cent).
About 16 per cent of employees changed
jobs in 1996, according to a survey by the
Confederation of British Industry. Turnover
was higher for part-time workers (25 per cent)
than for full-time workers (12 per cent). By
industry sector, turnover was highest in
retailing and wholesaling (39 per cent) and
lowest in local government and manufacturing
(7 per cent). Most people left their job
voluntarily, although 22 per cent of full-time
employees left because of redundancy.
Government Employment Services
The Government provides a range of services
to jobseekers through the Employment
Service, an executive agency of the
Department for Education and Employment.
These include:
• a network of local offices, at which people
can find details of job opportunities;
• advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into employment,
for example, by training; and
• a range of special programmes.
The Employment Service has about 1,030
Jobcentres and a budget of £1,188 million for
1997-98. In 1996-97 it placed 1.7 million
unemployed people into jobs and conducted
some 7.3 million advisory interviews to help
people find appropriate work or places on
employment and training programmes.
Advisory Services
Through the main Jobcentre services,
unemployed people have access to vacancies,
177
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
employment advice and training opportunities.
Employment Service advisers see all jobseekers
when a claim is made for Jobseeker’s Allowance
(see p. 427) to assess their eligibility and to
provide advice about jobs, training and self-
employment opportunities. To receive the
allowance, each unemployed person has to
complete a Jobseeker’s Agreement, which
includes details of availability for work and the
steps that he or she has agreed to take to find
work. Unemployed people are required to
attend a Restart advisory interview every six
months, when an adviser reviews with the
jobseeker his or her situation and, if
appropriate, revises the Jobseeker’s Agreement.
The Employment Service will be
responsible for delivering the New Deal
programmes for the young and long-term
unemployed (see p. 173). It currently runs a
variety of programmes. Among those for the
long-term unemployed are:
• ‘1-2-1’, a programme offering 180,000
opportunities in 1997-98, which is
designed to provide intensive help with
looking for jobs for those who have been
unemployed for over a year;
• Jobplan, which provides guidance and
other support to enable those unemployed
for a year to assess their skills, qualities
and training needs, and to act as an
introduction to future job and training
options;
• Jobclubs, where participants are given
training and advice in job-hunting skills
and have access to facilities to help an
intensive job search;
• Restart courses, designed to rebuild self-
confidenCe and motivation, and including
help with job-hunting skills; and
• Project Work, which is aimed at people
who have been unemployed for two years
or more and who are aged between 18
and 50. It offers an intensive period of
help in finding a job, followed by a
period of practical work experience of
benefit to the local community.
Help for People with Disabilities
Most disabled people assisted by the
Employment Service are helped through its
mainstream services, and have priority access
to the main programmes for unemployed
people. Services for people with disabilities
who need more specialist help to get or keep a
job are available through Disability
Employment Advisers based in Jobcentres.
The advisers are members of local integrated
specialist teams—Placing Assessment and
Counselling Teams.
These services include:
• the Access to Work programme, which
helps people with disabilities to overcome
barriers to employment; and
• the Supported Employment Programme,
which supports jobs for over 22,000
people with severe disabilities. The
programme helps people who are able to
undertake meaningful employment, but
who cannot obtain or retain jobs in open
employment because of the severity of
their disability and who have a limited
productivity.
Employment Agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with many
branches. The total value of the market has
been estimated at about £8,000 million a year.
The law governing employment agencies is
less restrictive than in many other EU
countries. However, agencies must comply
with legislation which seeks to protect agency
users, both workers and hirers, by creating a
framework of minimum standards. The
Department of Trade and Industry is
responsible for investigating complaints.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT
Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees have a right to a
written statement setting out details of the
main conditions, including pay, hours of work
and holidays. Employees with at least two
years of continuous employment with their
employer are entitled to lump-sum
178
EMPLOYMENT
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist, and their employers cannot offer
suitable alternative work. Where employers
are insolvent, redundancy payments are met
directly from the National Insurance fund.
Minimum periods of notice when
employment is to be terminated are laid down
for both employers and employees. Most
employees who believe they have been
unfairly dismissed have the right to complain
to an industrial tribunal (see below), subject to
the general qualifying period of two years’
continuous service. If the complaint is upheld,
the tribunal may make an order for re¬
employment or award compensation.
All pregnant employees have the right to 14
weeks’ statutory maternity leave with their
non-wage contractual benefits maintained, and
protection against dismissal because of
pregnancy.
Under the Disability Discrimination Act
1995, disabled people have the right not to be
discriminated against in employment.
Employers with 20 or more employees have a
duty not to discriminate against disabled
employees or applicants. A Code of Practice
gives guidance to employers on the Act’s
requirements.
Legislation forbids any employment of
children under 13 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of
children who have not reached the statutory
minimum school-leaving age, with some
exceptions for family undertakings. Some
minor changes are planned to bring the law
into line with the EC Directive on the
Protection of Young People at Work. A
permitted list of occupations would be set for
those aged 13, and children would be required
to have a period free from work during school
holidays.
Equal Opportunities
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it
generally unlawful to discriminate on grounds
of colour, race, nationality (including
citizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters.
The Department for Education and
Employment’s Race Relations Employment
Advisory Service promotes those government
policies aimed at combating racial
discrimination in employment and at ensuring
fair treatment and equality of opportunity in
employment. Advisers provide employers
with practical help in developing and
implementing effective equal opportunity
strategies.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, as
amended, makes it generally unlawful in Great
Britain to discriminate on grounds of sex or
marital status when recruiting, training,
promoting, dismissing or retiring staff. The
Equal Pay Act 1970 makes it generally unlawful
to discriminate between men and women in pay
and other terms and conditions of employment.
The Act was significantly extended in 1984 to
meet EU requirements by providing for equal
pay for work of equal value.
Practical advice to employers and others on
the best arrangements for implementing equal
opportunities policies in Great Britain is given
in codes of practice from the Commission for
Racial Equality and from the Equal
Opportunities Commission (see p. 44). The
Government is encouraging voluntary action
by employers to increase the employment
opportunities for women and supports the
‘Opportunity 2000’ campaign (see p. 43).
Similar legislation to that in Great Britain
on equal pay and sex discrimination applies in
Northern Ireland, and legislation on race
relations was introduced in August 1997.
Discrimination in employment on grounds of
religious belief or political opinion is unlawful.
The Fair Employment Commission (see p. 17)
has the task of promoting equality of
opportunity and investigating employment
practices, with powers to issue legally
enforceable directions. The Government is
considering a report on employment equality
by the Standing Advisory Commission on
Human Rights (SACHR), issued in June
1997. The report has proposed changes to
policies and procedures in education, training
and other areas (see p. 17).
Industrial Tribunals
Industrial tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints on a range of
employment rights, including unfair dismissal,
redundancy pay, equal pay, and sex and race
179
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
discrimination. They received 89,000
applications in 1996-97 and the number of
cases continues to grow steadily.
The Government is supporting a Private
Peer’s Bill, now before Parliament, which
would streamline industrial tribunal
procedures and introduce new voluntary
procedures to resolve disputes on
employment rights. Industrial tribunals
would be renamed employment tribunals to
reflect their new role. An important aspect of
the Bill concerns alternative means of
resolving disputes, in particular provision to
allow those involved in unfair dismissal
disputes to opt for a binding arbitration
scheme run by ACAS (see p. 184) which
would be cheaper and less formal than going
through tribunal procedures.
Northern Ireland has a separate tribunal
system. Reform of tribunals there will take
into account the SACHR’s review and its
recommendations on tribunals.
Earnings
According to the official New Earnings
Survey, the average weekly earnings,
unaffected by absence and including overtime
payments, in Great Britain in April 1997 of
full-time employees on adult rates were £368.
Earnings were higher for non-manual
employees (£407) than for manual employees
(£293), with managerial and professional
groups the highest paid. The sectors with the
highest average weekly earnings are financial
services (£494) and mining and quarrying
(£474), while the sectors with the lowest
earnings are hotels and restaurants, the
manufacture of textiles and textile products,
agriculture, hunting and forestry, and the
retail trade.
Overtime and other additional payments
are particularly important for manual
employees, for whom such additional
payments represented over one-fifth of
earnings. About 50 per cent of manual
employees and 19 per cent of non-manual
employees received overtime payments.
In the year to August 1997 the underlying
average increase in earnings in Great Britain
was about 4.5 per cent, compared with a rise of
3.5 per cent in the Retail Prices Index.
Fringe Benefits
A variety of fringe benefits are used by
employers to provide additional rewards to
their employees, including schemes to
encourage employee financial participation in
their companies, pension schemes, private
medical insurance, subsidised meals, company
cars and childcare schemes.
Many employees are covered by pension
schemes provided by their employers. Such
benefits are more usual among clerical and
professional employees than among manual
workers. About 11 million people in Britain
are active members of occupational pension
schemes.
Company cars are provided for employees
in a wide variety of circumstances. Around
1.7 million people have a company car
available for private use and about half of
these receive fuel for private motoring in
their car.
Profit-related pay (PRP) schemes, which
link part of pay to changes in a business’s
profits, have become more extensive. By the
end of March 1997, some 14,500 PRP
schemes were registered with the Inland
Revenue, covering around 4.1 million
people. Many companies have adopted
employee share schemes, where employees
receive free shares or options to buy shares at
a discount from their employer without
paying income tax.
Hours of Work
Most full-time employees have a basic
working week of between 34 and 40 hours,
and work a five-day week. When overtime is
taken into account, average weekly hours
worked by full-time employees on adult rates
in Great Britain in April 1997 were 41.8 for
men and 37.6 for women. More men than
women work overtime, and those in manual
occupations generally work more overtime
than employees in non-manual jobs.
Both male and female full-time employees
tend to work more hours than in other EU
countries. Hours worked tend to be longest in
agriculture, construction and transport and
communications, and shortest in most service
industries.
180
EMPLOYMENT
The Government intends to press ahead to
implement the European Community (EC)
directive on working time. The directive
will apply to most sectors, with some
exceptions, such as in the transport and
offshore oil sectors. Legislation will set
limits on maximum weekly working hours,
place restrictions on night-time working,
and create entitlements to minimum rest
periods and paid annual leave.
Flexible working patterns are becoming
more widespread, and are now followed by
around one-fifth of employees. The most
common aspect is flexible working hours,
which were worked by 13 per cent of female
and 9 per cent of male full-time employees in
spring 1996.
Holidays with Pay
Holiday entitlements have generally been
determined by negotiation. In spring 1996 the
average paid holiday entitlement for full-time
workers was just under five weeks. However,
some employees, such as part-time and
temporary employees, may have much less
holiday entitlement. Under the EC’s directive
on working time, there will be provision for
three weeks’ paid holiday a year, rising to four
weeks in 1999.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in Britain
has been established mainly on a voluntary
basis. The system is based chiefly on the
organisation of employees and employers into
trade unions and employers’ associations, and
on freely conducted negotiations at all levels.
Trends in Bargaining and Pay
Some 8.1 million employees (37 per cent of
employees) in Great Britain in 1996 were in
workplaces covered by collective bargaining.
Public sector employees are more likely than
those in the private sector to be covered by
collective bargaining, which is generally more
prevalent in large establishments. Collective
bargaining mainly concerns pay and working
conditions, although there have been a
number of examples of agreements covering
job security and minimum employment
standards.
The general trend, though, is for more
negotiation to be conducted at a local level,
although many large firms retain a degree of
central control over the bargaining process.
Industry-wide agreements in the private
sector are often supplemented by local
agreements in companies or factories (plant
bargaining). Most medium and large
employers make some use of performance-
related pay systems such as profit-related pay
and payment by results. Performance-related
pay has also become much more widespread in
the public sector.
Recently negotiated agreements have often
featured greater flexibility in working
practices, the adoption of integrated wage
structures for manual and non-manual
workers in ‘single status’ deals, and more
emphasis on multiskilling and teamworking.
A new pay agreement for local government
became effective in April 1997, covering
some 1.3 million workers. It is thought to
be the largest of its type in Britain. The
agreement introduces equal status for
manual and non-manual workers by the
year 2000, establishes a minimum wage for
the lowest paid workers, and provides for
the same rights for part-time and
temporary staff as for full-time employees.
Employee Involvement
The Government believes that the best
companies recognise their employees as
partners in the enterprise. Employers use a
variety of methods of involving their
employees in the running of the organisations
in which they work. These methods include
employee bulletins and reports, quality circles,
suggestion schemes and attitude surveys as
well as works councils and other forms of
information and consultation mechanisms.
One of the EC measures which will
eventually come into force in Britain following
the acceptance of the social chapter is the
181
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
European Works Councils Directive, which
will require firms with 1,000 or more
employees and which operate in two or more
member states to establish European-level
information and consultation procedures. A
number of the largest British-based
multinational companies, such as Barclays Bank
and ICI, have already set up European Works
Councils, including their British workforce.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. They are widely recognised by
employers in the public sector and in large
firms and establishments. As well as
negotiating pay and other terms and
conditions of employment with employers,
they provide benefits and services such as
educational facilities, financial services, legal
advice and aid in work-related cases. In recent
years many unions have extended their range
of services for members.
In 1996 there were 7.2 million trade union
members in Great Britain, 20 per cent fewer
than in 1989. During this period the
proportion of employees who are union
members fell from 39 to 31 per cent. The
decline in membership was particularly
noticeable where it has traditionally been
high—among male employees, manual
workers and those in production industries.
Union membership is now at a similar level
among manual and non-manual employees,
having fallen much less in the latter group. It
is now only slightly higher for men (33 per
cent) than for women (29 per cent).
Rail transport has the highest proportion of
union members, around 75 per cent of
employees. Among female workers, banks and
building societies have the highest level (56
per cent). Sectors with relatively few union
members include agriculture, forestry and
fishing, hotels and restaurants, and
wholesaling.
Unison, with about 1.4 million members, is
the biggest union in Britain, accounting for 17
per cent of all union members. Three other
unions have over 500,000 members:
• the Transport and General Workers
Union (with 897,000 members);
• GMB (740,000)—a general union with
members in a range of public and private
sector industries; and
• the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union (726,000).
The number of unions has declined by
around a third in the last 20 years, mainly as a
result of mergers. At the end of 1996 there
were 245 trade unions on the list maintained
by the Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must show
that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and
employers or between workers and employers’
associations. A further 20 unions were known
to the Certification Officer.
Trades Union Congress
In Britain the national body of the trade union
movement is the Trades Union Congress
(TUC), founded in 1868. Its affiliated
membership comprises 74 trade unions, which
together represent some 6.8 million people.
The TUC’s objectives are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to
improve the economic and social conditions of
working people. It deals with all general
questions concerning trade unions, and provides
a forum in which affiliated unions can
collectively determine policy. There are six
TUC regional councils for England and a Wales
Trades Union Council. The annual Congress
meets in September to discuss matters of
concern to trade unionists. A General Council
represents the TUC between annual meetings.
The TUC plays an active part in
international trade union activity, through its
affiliation to the International Confederation of
Free Trade Unions and the European Trade
Union Confederation. It also nominates the
British workers’ delegation to the annual
International Labour Conference.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
Trade unions in Scotland also have their own
national central body, the Scottish Trades
182
EMPLOYMENT
Union Congress, to which British unions
usually affiliate their Scottish branches.
Nearly all trade unions in Northern Ireland
are represented by the Northern Ireland
Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU). Most trade unionists in
Northern Ireland are members of unions
affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority also
belong to unions based in Great Britain which
are affiliated to the TUC. The Northern
Ireland Committee of the ICTU enjoys a high
degree of autonomy.
Legal Requirements
The Government’s view is that there should
be a suitable balance in industrial relations
law, with minimum standards for the
individual at work. It intends to retain the
framework established by the previous
Government. However, it plans to make a
number of changes to the law. The main
change will be a new right for a trade union to
be recognised where a majority of the
workforce vote in a ballot for representation
by the union. Before introducing any changes,
interested parties will be fully consulted.
Union Membership and Non-membership Rights
All individuals have the right under the law
not to be dismissed or refused employment (or
the services of an employment agency)
because of membership or non-membership of
a trade union. Individuals who believe that
they have been dismissed or refused
employment on such grounds may complain
to an industrial tribunal. Employees who are
union members also have the right not to have
union membership subscriptions deducted
from their pay without their authorisation.
The Conduct of Union Affairs
A trade union must elect every member of its
governing body, its general secretary and its
president. Elections must be held at least
every five years and be carried out by a secret
postal ballot under independent scrutiny.
A trade union may establish a political fund
if it wishes to use its money for what the law
defines as ‘political objects’. If a union wishes
to set up a political fund, its members must
first agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an aim of'
the union. The union must also ballot its
members every ten years to maintain the fund.
Union members have a statutory right to opt
out of contributing to a political fund.
Union members have the right to inspect
their union’s accounting records and obtain an
annual statement about its financial affairs.
Industrial Action
For a union to have the benefit of statutory
immunity when organising industrial action,
the action must be wholly or mainly in
contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute
between workers and their own employer.
Various other requirements must be met. For
example, industrial action must not involve
workers who have no dispute with their own
employer (so-called ‘secondary’ action) or
involve unlawful forms of picketing. Before
calling for industrial action, a trade union must
first obtain the support of its members in a
secret postal ballot and must notify employers
of its intention to conduct such a ballot.
Industrial Disputes
The number of days lost as a result of
industrial action in 1994 and 1995 (see Table
12.4) were the lowest annual figures since
records began in 1891. Disputes increased in
1996, reflecting increased strike rates in the
transport, storage and communications sector,
and in the education and public administration
sectors. However, the number of days lost (1.3
million) remained below the levels in the
1970s and 1980s.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in Britain are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters, although
others are also trade associations concerned with
commercial matters in general. With the move
away from national pay bargaining, many
employers’ associations are tending to
concentrate on areas such as supplying

information for bargaining purposes and dealing
with specialist issues. As with some of the larger
trade unions, a number of employers’
associations are increasingly concerned with
legislation and other issues relating to Europe.
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely local
in character or deal with a section of an industry
or, for example, with small businesses; most are
national and are concerned with the whole of an
industry. In some of the main industries there
are local or regional organisations combined into
national federations. At the end of 1996, 110
listed and 115 unlisted employers’ associations
were known to the Certification Officer.
Most national organisations belong to the

which represents directly or indirectly some
250,000 businesses.
joint involvement of employers and
employees, and the provision of a public
enquiry service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual employment rights.
In 1996 ACAS:
• received over 1,300 requests for collective
conciliation, of which nearly half related
to pay or other terms and conditions of
employment, and handled 117 arbitration
cases;
• received 100,400 individual conciliation
cases, 10 per cent more than in 1995; and
• answered over 446,000 calls on
employment-related matters through its
public enquiry points.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body with a general duty of promoting the
improvement of industrial relations. ACAS
aims to operate through the voluntary co¬
operation of employers, employees and, where
appropriate, their representatives. Its main
functions are collective conciliation, provision
of arbitration and mediation facilities, advisory
mediation services for preventing disputes and
improving industrial relations through the
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Health and safety standards in Britain are
among the best in the world. There has been a
long-term decline in injuries to employees,
reflecting improvements in safety, together
with a change in industrial structure away
from the traditional heavy industries, which
tend to have higher risks. In 1995-96 the
number of deaths for employees and the self-
employed from accidents at work was 256,
which represented a fatal accident rate of 1.0
per 100,000 workers. About 18 million
working days a year are lost as a result of
184
EMPLOYMENT
work-related injuries and 13 million from
work-related illnesses.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes
general duties on everyone concerned with
work activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of w ork.
Employers with five or more staff must prepare
a written statement of their health and safety
policy and bring it to the attention of their staff.
The Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations 1988 (which were revised
in 1994) constitute one of the most important
sets of regulations made under the 1974 Act.
They replaced a range of outdated legislation
by a comprehensive and systematic approach
to the control of exposure to virtually all
substances hazardous to health.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC)
has responsibility for developing policy on
health and safety at work in Great Britain,
including proposals for new or revised
regulations and approved codes of practice.
The HSC has advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic modification and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each covering a specific
sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is
the primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. Its field services
and inspections are carried out by the Field
Operations Directorate. This incorporates the
Factory, Agricultural and Quarries
inspectorates, together with the regional staff
of the Employment Medical Advisory Service
and the Regional Specialist Groups, which
provide technical support to the
inspectorates.
The HSE’s Directorate of Science and
Technology provides technical advice on
industrial health and safety matters. The
Health and Safety Laboratory provides
scientific and medical support and testing
services, and carries out research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health
and safety legislation is enforced by inspectors
appointed by local authorities, working under
guidance from the HSE. Some other official
bodies work under agency agreement with the
HSE.
Northern Ireland
The general requirements of the Northern
Ireland health and safety legislation are broadly
similar to those for Great Britain. They are
enforced mainly by the Department of
Economic Development and the Department of
Agriculture through their health and safety
inspectorates, although the district councils have
an enforcement role similar to that of local
authorities in Great Britain. There is a Health
and Safety Agency, roughly corresponding to
the HSC but without its policy-making powers,
and an Employment Medical Advisory Service.

Structure and Organisation 186 Government Policy 189
of Industry
The health of British industry is vital to the wealth of the nation. The
Government’s key objective for business is to provide a stable economic
environment, to encourage investment and enterprise, and to broaden the
industrial base. In 1997 it launched an initiative on competitiveness, and is
planning to introduce a new Competition Bill.
STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION
OF INDUSTRY
Private sector enterprises now account for by
far the greater part of activity in the
agricultural, manufacturing, construction,
distributive, financial and other service
sectors. Some 50 major public sector
businesses, including gas, electricity supply,
coal and telecommunications, have been
privatised since 1979.
In some sectors, a small number of large
companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a substantial proportion of
total production, for instance in the chemical,
motor vehicle and aerospace industries. About
250 British industrial companies each have an
annual turnover of over £500 million; 16 are
among the top 25 European companies in
terms of profitability. Among the biggest
British-owned companies are BP, ICI, Glaxo
Wellcome, British Aerospace, BT and GEC.
Small firms with fewer than 100 staff provide
over 50 per cent of the private sector
workforce. Industries with the fastest growth
rates in recent years are in the services sector,
particularly finance, property, and
professional and business services.
Legal Framework
All British companies are registered with the
Registrar of Companies. Companies with a
place of business or branch in Britain, but
which are incorporated overseas, are also
required to register. Legislation deals with
capital structure, rights and duties of directors
and members, and the preparation and filing
of accounts (see p. 187). Most corporate
businesses are ‘limited liability’ companies.
The liability of members of a limited company
is restricted to contributing an amount related
to their shareholding (or to their guarantee
where companies are limited by guarantee). In
the case of unincorporated businesses, such as
sole proprietorships or partnerships,
individuals are personally liable for any
business debts, except where a member of a
partnership is a limited liability company or a
limited member of a limited partnership.
However, proposals for making limited
liability partnerships available to regulated
professions are being reviewed.
Companies may be either public or private.
A company must satisfy certain conditions
before it can become a public limited company
(pic). It must:
186
INDUSTRY
• be limited by shares or guarantee and
have a share capital;
• state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company;
• meet specified minimum capital
requirements; and
• have as the suffix to its name the words
‘public limited company’ or ‘pic’.
All other British companies are private
companies and are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Industrial Financing
Over half of companies’ funds for investment
and other purposes is generated internally.
Banks are the chief external source of finance,
but companies have increasingly turned to
equity finance. The main forms of short-term
finance in the private sector are bank
overdrafts, trade credit and factoring (making
cash available to a company in exchange for
debts owing to it).
Types of medium- and long-term finance
include bank loans, mortgaging of property
and the issue of shares and other securities to
the public through the London Stock
Exchange. The leasing of equipment may also
be regarded as a form of finance. Other
sources of funding for industry include
government, the European Union (EU) and
specialist financial institutions, such as
financing and leasing, factoring, and venture
capital companies.
Venture Capital
Venture capital provides long-term equity
capital for unquoted companies which are
starting up or expanding as well as those
undergoing management buy-outs and buy-
ins. It is available principally from venture
capital firms. The British Venture Capital
Association has 101 full members, which
represent virtually every major source of
venture capital in Britain. During 1996,
£3,239 million was invested by British venture
capital companies in 1,200 businesses; of this,
over £2,800 million was invested in Britain.
Some 49 per cent of venture capital deals were
in expansion-stage companies; 74 per cent of
the total amount was invested in management
buy-outs and buy-ins.
‘Business angels’ (private investors) are an
increasingly important source of smaller
amounts of early-stage venture capital. The
Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and
Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) seek to
encourage individuals to invest in smaller
unlisted trading companies in return for
various tax reliefs. Introduced in 1994 and
1995 respectively, the EIS and VCTs are
designed to help smaller early-stage and
expanding firms. The EIS allows business
angels to take a position on the board of the
investee company. VCTs are similar to an
investment trust and are quoted on the Stock
Exchange; they are more suited to less active
investors.
Taxation
The rates of corporation tax were reduced in
the July 1997 Budget (see p. 162) in order to
promote greater long-term investment and
reduce the tax burden on smaller companies.
The main rate of corporation tax was lowered
from 33 to 31 per cent, and for small firms
(those with annual profits of less than
^300,000) the rate was brought down from 23
to 21 per cent. For companies with profits of
between £300,000 and £1.5 million, the
overall corporation tax rate is between the
main rate and the rate for small firms.
Expenditure on business plant and machinery,
industrial building, and scientific research
qualifies for annual allowances against profit
for tax purposes.
Company Law
Laws relating to companies are designed to
meet the need for proper regulation of
business, to maintain open markets and to
create safeguards for those wishing to invest in
companies or do business with them. They
take account of EC (European Community)
directives on company law, and on company
and group accounts and their auditing.
The Stock Exchange requires firms to state
whether they are complying with a Code of
Best Practice, recommended in 1992 by the
187
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Cadbury Committee Report on the
management of companies, and give reasons
for areas of non-compliance. Shareholders,
including institutional shareholders, are
encouraged by the Government to play a more
active role in overseeing management. Insider
dealing in shares is a criminal offence and
inspectors may be appointed to investigate
possible occurrences of it. A licensing
procedure helps guarantee the professional
competence, integrity and independence of
people acting as trustees of bankrupt
individuals, or as liquidators, receivers or
administrators of insolvent companies.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
is the largest employers’ organisation in
Britain, representing about 250,000
companies. Most national employers’
organisations, trade associations, and some
chambers of commerce are also members. The
CBI aims to ensure that the Government,
national and international institutions and the
general public understand the needs,
intentions and problems of business. It
campaigns to lessen the administrative and
regulatory burdens on business, tackle
handicaps on competition, and improve the
performance of companies. It offers members
a forum, a lobby and a range of advisory
services. The CBI also conducts surveys of
activity in manufacturing, distribution,
financial services, the regions, property,
innovation, and pay and productivity. It has
13 regional offices and an office in Brussels.
The CBI is the British member of the Union
of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations
of Europe.
Chambers of commerce represent business
views to the Government at national and local
levels. They promote local economic
development, for example, through
regeneration projects, tourism, inward
investment promotion and business services,
including overseas trade missions, exhibitions
and training conferences. The Association of
British Chambers of Commerce, representing
about 100,000 businesses, provides
commercial and export-related services and
publishes business surveys. The Institute of
Directors (IOD) has 27,400 members in
Britain, many of whom are from small
businesses. It provides business advisory
services on matters affecting company
directors, such as corporate management,
insolvency and career counselling, and
represents the interests of members to
authorities in Britain and the EU.
The Federation of Small Businesses is the
main organisation representing the interests of
the self-employed and small firms. The
Federation advances the cause of more than
90,000 small businesses, raises public
awareness of its members’ issues, and supplies
information on subjects such as employment,
environment, Europe, finance and taxation.
Trade associations represent companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to supply
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members in dealings with
government departments.
Nationalised Industries
The remaining major nationalised industries
are the Post Office, London Transport, and
the Civil Aviation Authority. Managing
boards are appointed by ministers, who have
power to give general directions but are not
engaged in day-to-day management.
Managing boards and staffs of nationalised
industries are not civil servants.
The nationalised industries are required to
act as commercial enterprises and are expected
to conform to specific guidelines. These
involve:
• clear government objectives;
• regular corporate plans and performance
reviews;
• agreed principles relating to investment
and pricing;
• financial and performance targets;
• external financing limits; and
• systematic monitoring.
The Government is reviewing the future
status of London Transport and the Civil
Aviation Authority, and options for granting
the Post Office greater commercial freedom.

INDUSTRY
GOVERNMENT POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is the department mainly responsible
for the Government’s relations with industry
and commerce. Specific areas of responsibility
which are dealt with in this chapter include
company law, small firms, competition policy
and consumer affairs, intellectual property,
regional industrial development and inward
investment. The Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
oversees provision of regional industrial aid
through the Government Offices for the
Regions (see p. 6). The Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Offices are responsible for
industrial policies in their areas. Export
promotion, and technology and innovation,
which are also part of the DTFs remit, are
dealt with in chapters 14 and 20 respectively.
The DTPs duties regarding industrial
relations are covered in chapter 12.
DTI Aims
The DTI seeks to work in partnership with
businesses and the scientific community to
achieve excellence in science and to support
the endeavours of business to become as
competitive as possible, so expanding the
country’s wealth, and providing employment.
On its side of the partnership, the DTI
aims to:
• promote open and competitive markets at
home and abroad;
• encourage the development of a skilled
and flexible labour market founded on
the principle of social partnership;
• encourage investment, the pursuit of
quality and good management practice;
• provide support for small and medium¬
sized firms;
• foster economic growth and
competitiveness in the regions;
• strengthen support for British business
abroad;
• give consumers a fair deal;
• maintain and enforce an effective
framework for commercial activity while
removing unnecessary burdens on business;
• help business take full advantage of
technological developments and follow
sound environmental policies; and
• maximise the contribution of science,
engineering and technology to
sustainable growth and quality of life.
EU Single Market
Britain, as a member of the EU, has firmly
supported the development of the single
market. The Government considers that the
single market (see p. 125) is beneficial to the
economies of all member states of the EU, and
that removal of trade barriers will lead to
reduced business costs and greater
competition and efficiency. It is committed to
making progress on issues that would lead to
the completion of the single market, including
removing remaining barriers to investment,
opening up government procurement, making
competition policy more streamlined and
reducing bureaucracy.
Specific advantages of the single market
include:
• wider consumer choice;
• removal of barriers to trade through
mutual recognition of standards and
harmonisation;
• the right to trade financial services
throughout the EU on the basis of a single
authorisation ‘passport’ (see p. 235);
• mutual recognition of professional and
vocational qualifications; and
• a reduction in export business
bureaucracy.
Competitiveness
Maintaining and helping to improve the
competitiveness of business are the centre of
the Government’s approach to economic and
industrial policy. It believes that a competitive
Britain is the only way to deliver wealth and
prosperity, as well as employment. The
Government’s priority is to work in close
partnership with industry.
To further this partnership, therefore, the
Government launched in 1997 an initiative—
189
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Competitiveness UK: our partnership with
business. A number of measures have already
been announced, including:
• the establishment of an Advisory Group
on Competitiveness, comprising
prominent business people and other key
partners, to offer practical and informed
advice on issues affecting British
competitiveness;
• an audit of industry’s competitiveness
setting out how Britain compares with its
overseas competitors across a range of
competitiveness indicators;
• the establishment of working parties of
business people to offer detailed advice
on such issues as innovation, investment
and exports, which will be taken into
account in government proposals to be
presented in a White Paper during 1998;
• plans to establish a University for
Industry, designed to provide
opportunities for adults to improve their
skills (see p. 194);
• measures designed to improve vocational
preparation and training for young
people, including the unemployed (see
chapter 12);
• a review of government support to
smaller firms, including measures to
strengthen the quality of Business Link
services (see p. 195); and
• plans to establish Regional Development
Agencies (see p. 371).
Regulation
The Government considers that, while bad
regulation is a burden on business, especially
small firms, good regulation is of value both
for public and consumer protection and for
carrying out the functions of government.
Under a new Work for Better Regulation
programme, regulatory policy will focus on
ensuring regulations are necessary, fair to all
parties, properly costed, practical to enforce
and straightforward to comply with. The
programme will involve:
• greater consultation with business and
the public and the establishment of a new
taskforce, half of whose members will
represent small firms, to oversee the
consultation process;
• proper published assessment of the cost
and benefits of proposed regulations,
especially for consumers and the
environment;
• clear and accessible information and
advice on necessary regulations from a
unified service, open to business and
other interested groups such as the
elderly and the voluntary sector; and
• promoting better-quality regulations in
Europe.
In addition, a review of regulatory policy is
being undertaken with the object of ensuring
that necessary regulation provides a
framework which helps business and
encourages innovation, investment and
growth.
Independent regulatory bodies exist for the
privatised utilities—telecommunications,
electricity, gas, water and so on—with
powers and duties to promote competition
and the interests of consumers. These
usually include considering all complaints
and representations about the companies’
services. Each privatised utility operates
under a pricing policy set by the regulator,
which often limits annual price increases to
significantly less than the rate of inflation.
An interdepartmental review of utility
regulation was announced in June 1997.
The review will concentrate on gas,
electricity, telecommunications and water,
although it will also consider whether
there are lessons to be learned from other
regulatory experiences.
Competition Policy and Markets
The Government considers that competition
is essential to the efficient working of markets,
as it encourages enterprise and efficiency and
widens choice, so providing for consumers
greater value for money and quality. The
overall aim of competition policy is to
encourage and enhance the competitive
process. The law provides several ways in
190
INDUSTRY
which market situations can be examined and,
if necessary, altered.
Responsibility for competition policy lies
with the President of the Board of Trade (the
ministerial head of the DTI). Competition law
is administered by the Director General of
Fair Trading, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC) and the Restrictive
Practices Court. The principal legislation
comprises:
• the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the
Competition Act 1980, which deal with
mergers and monopolies, and anti¬
competitive practices respectively;
• the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976,
which regulates agreements between
people or companies that could limit
their freedom to operate independently;
and
• the Resale Prices Act 1976, covering
attempts to impose minimum prices at
which goods can be sold.
The Government intends to introduce a
Competition Bill, which will be based closely on
EC competition rules. Its aim is to reform
competition in a way which is both effective in
addressing anti-competitive practices and avoids
unnecessary burdens on business. It plans to
achieve this aim by prohibiting anti-competitive
agreements and the abuse of market power.
Only those businesses which are involved in
anti-competitive agreements, cartels and similar
practices will be affected by the first
prohibition, compared with the present
situation where businesses are required to
notify, often innocuous, agreements, to the
Office of Fair Trading. The new legislation will
replace the Restrictive Trade Practices
legislation of 1976 and 1977, the Resale Prices
Act 1976 and certain provisions of the
Competition Act 1980. The second prohibition
covering abuse of a dominant position
strengthens the existing regime operated under
the Fair Trading Act.
Monopolies
A simple monopoly is defined as a situation
where a company or group of companies
supplies or purchases 25 per cent or more of a
particular product or service in Britain, or a
defined part of Britain. A complex monopoly
is a situation where a number of companies or
groups together have 25 per cent or more of
the market and behave in a way that adversely
affects competition.
The Director General of Fair Trading may
enquire into possible abuse of a monopoly
position. If an investigation shows that a
monopoly situation exists, the Director
General can refer the matter to the MMC for
further investigation. The MMC consists of a
wide range of specialists, including
businessmen and women, lawyers, economists
and trade unionists. If the MMC finds that a
monopoly situation operates, or may be
expected to operate, against the public
interest, the President of the Board of Trade
can take steps to remedy the matter. This is
usually in the form of a request to the Director
General to negotiate appropriate
undertakings.
Mergers
Broadly, a merger situation qualifies for
investigation if it involves the acquisition of
gross assets worth £70 million or more, or the
creation or enhancement of a 25 per cent share
of the supply of goods or services of any
description in Britain or a substantial part
of it.
Qualifying mergers are considered by the
Director General of Fair Trading, who then
advises the President of the Board of Trade.
There is a voluntary procedure for pre-
notification of proposed mergers which offers
prompt clearance of straightforward cases.
The majority of mergers are not found to
operate against the public interest and are not
prohibited. However, if there are reasonable
grounds for believing that a merger could have
a detrimental effect, the Director General can
advise the President of the Board of Trade to
refer it to the MMC. Alternatively, the
Director General may be asked to obtain
suitable undertakings from the companies
involved to remedy the adverse effects
identified. The President of the Board of
Trade may accept undertakings by the parties
concerned to dispose of assets or to behave in a
certain way in order to eliminate the need for a
full investigation by the MMC.
191
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
If a merger or proposed merger is referred
and the MMC finds that it could be expected
to operate against the public interest, the
President of the Board of Trade can prohibit it
or allow it subject to certain conditions being
met. Where the merger has already taken
place, action can be taken to reverse it. There
are special provisions for newspaper and water
company mergers.
Certain mergers with an EC dimension,
assessed by reference to turnover, come under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the European
Commission. The Commission can ban
mergers if it concludes that they create or
strengthen a dominant position which would
significantly impede effective competition
within the EU or a substantial part of it;
alternatively, it may negotiate undertakings to
correct the adverse effect.
Anti-competitive Practices
The Director General of Fair Trading can
investigate the conduct of any business which
may restrict, distort or prevent competition
concerning the supply or acquisition of goods
and/or services. If a practice is found to be
anti-competitive, undertakings may be sought
from the business responsible for the conduct.
In the event of a suitable undertaking not
being given, the matter may be referred to the
MMC. In the case of an adverse finding by the
MMC, the President of the Board of Trade
has powers to take remedial action. Broadly,
businesses are exempt from investigation if
they have a turnover of less than ^10 million,
or have less than 25 per cent of a relevant
market in Britain.
Restrictive Trade Practices
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act requires,
with some exceptions, that particulars of
business agreements containing certain anti¬
competitive restrictions have to be notified to
the Director General of Fair Trading for
registration. The most serious restrictions are
those fixing prices or dividing markets. Unless
the restrictions in an agreement are
insignificant, the Director General must refer
it to the Restrictive Practices Court. Where
the Court finds the restrictions to be against
the public interest, it will make an order
prohibiting them, or may accept undertakings
given in lieu of an order.
Resale Price Maintenance
It is in general unlawful for manufacturers or
suppliers to stipulate to dealers or retailers a
minimum resale price. It is also unlawful for
suppliers to seek to impose minimum resale
prices by withholding supplies of goods or by
discriminating against price-cutting dealers in
other ways. There is, however, the possibility
of exemption for particular classes of goods by
the Restrictive Practices Court on public
interest grounds. These exemptions remain in
force until it can be shown by the Director
General of Fair Trading, or third parties, to
the Court’s satisfaction that there has been a
material change in circumstances from the
time the exemptions were first granted. One
exemption is now in force in respect of certain
pharmaceuticals, but is being reviewed by the
Office of Fair Trading; another, the Net Book
Agreement, was made unlawful by the
Restrictive Practices Court in March 1997.
Consumer Protection
The Government aims to maintain and
develop a clear and fair regulatory framework
which gives confidence to consumers and
contributes to the competitiveness of business.
It works closely with outside bodies which
have expert knowledge of consumer issues to
develop policies and legislation.
Existing legislation covers the sale and
supply of goods and services. The Sale of
Goods Act 1979 (as amended in 1994) ensures
that consumers are entitled to receive goods
which fit their description and are of
satisfactory quality. The Trade Descriptions
Act 1968 prohibits misdescriptions of goods,
services, accommodation and facilities. This
Act enables regulations to be made requiring
information or instructions relating to goods
to be marked on or to accompany the goods or
to be included in advertisements. False or
misleading indications about prices of goods
are covered by the Consumer Protection Act
1987 which also makes it a criminal offence to
supply unsafe consumer products. A range of

INDUSTRY
public safety information for consumers is
made available by the DTI. The marking and
accuracy of quantities are regulated by weights
and measures legislation. Another law
provides for the control of medical products,
and certain other substances and articles,
through a system of licences and certificates.
The Director General of Fair Trading
promotes good trading practices and acts
against malpractice. Under the Fair Trading
Act, the Director General can recommend
legislative or other changes to stop practices
adversely affecting consumers’ economic
interests; encourage trade associations to
develop codes of practice promoting
consumers’ interests; and disseminate
consumer information and guidance. The
Director General can also take assurances as
to future conduct from traders who
persistently breach the law to the detriment of
consumers. The Unfair Terms in Consumer
Contracts Regulations empower the Director
General to act against traders using unfair
contract terms.
The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is
intended to protect consumers in their
dealings with credit businesses. Businesses
connected with the consumer credit or hire
industry or which supply ancillary credit
services—for example, credit brokers, debt
collectors, debt counsellors and credit
reference agencies—require a consumer
credit licence. The Director General is
responsible for administering the licensing
system, including revoking licences of those
unfit to hold them. He or she also has powers
to take court action to prevent the publication
of misleading advertisements, and to prohibit
unfit people from carrying out estate agency
work.
The EU’s consumer programme covers
activities such as health and safety, protection
of the consumer’s economic interests,
promotion of consumer education and
strengthening the representation of
consumers. The views of British consumer
organisations on EU matters are represented
by the Consumers in Europe Group (UK).
British consumer bodies also have a voice on
the European consumer ‘watchdog’ body, the
Bureau Europeen des Unions de
Consommateurs.
Consumer Advice and Information
Advice and information on consumer matters
are given by Citizens Advice Bureaux, trading
standards and consumer protection
departments of local authorities (in Northern
Ireland the Department of Economic
Development) and, in some areas, by specialist
consumer advice centres.
The National Consumer Council (and
associated councils for Scotland and Wales),
which receives government finance, presents
the consumer’s view to government, industry
and others. The General Consumer Council
for Northern Ireland has wide-ranging duties
in consumer affairs in general.
Consumer bodies for privatised utilities
investigate questions of concern to the
consumer (see p. 190). Some trade associations
in industry and commerce have established
codes of practice. In addition, several private
organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’
Association, funded by the subscriptions of its
700,000 or so members and publisher of
Which? magazine.
Design, Quality and Standards
A wider and more effective use of design can
make a significant contribution to improving
competitiveness. The application of good
design is paramount in the creation of
innovative products, processes and services.
The DTI supports the benefits of good design
through the independent Design Council. As
advocate for design at the national level, the
Council undertakes research into design
issues, develops design tools for use by
industry and publicises the results. A separate
design service offers support for industry
through Business Links in England (and
equivalent bodies in Scotland and Wales),
with financial support from the DTI (see
p. 195).
Quality is vital throughout the stages of the
business cycle—design, production,
marketing and delivery to customers.
Accreditation is a key method of improving
quality and competitiveness. Through its
support for consultancy projects, the
Government assists small and medium-sized
193
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
firms to learn about and apply quality
management techniques based on a national
standard—EN ISO 9000—meeting
international requirements. In order to
increase customer confidence, companies are
encouraged to obtain assessment and
certification to this standard. The competence
and performance of organisations undertaking
such certification are officially accredited by
the United Kingdom Accreditation Service.
Companies certified by accredited bodies are
permitted to use the national ‘crown and tick’
accreditation mark.
The DTI is responsible for policy relating
to the National Measurement System. This
provides, through several DTI-funded
agencies, many of the physical measurement
standards and associated calibration facilities
necessary so that measurements in Britain are
made on a common basis and to the required
accuracy (see p. 332).
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is the
national standards body and is the British
member of the European and international
standards organisations. It works with
industry, consumers and government to
produce standards relevant to the needs of the
market and suitable for public purchasing and
regulatory purposes. Government support for
the BSI is directed particularly towards
European and international standards, which
account for over 90 per cent of its work.
Harmonised standards contribute to removing
technical barriers to trade in the EU. The
Kitemark is the BSPs registered product
certification trade mark.
Awards
The Queen’s Awards for Export, Technological
and Environmental Achievement recognise
outstanding performance in their respective
fields. Awarded annually, they are valid for five
years and are granted by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister, who is assisted by
an Advisory Committee consisting of senior
representatives from business, trade unions
and government departments. Any self-
contained ‘industrial unit’ in Britain with at
least two employees is eligible to apply so long
as it meets the scheme’s criteria. Other awards
include the Export Award for Smaller
Businesses (for firms employing fewer than
200 people) and the MacRobert Award for
engineering made by the Fellowship of
Engineering for technological innovation.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation by
providing systems which enable the
originators of inventions and industrial
designs and the proprietors of trade marks to
protect their rights. These matters, along with
copyright in literary, artistic and musical
works, are the responsibility of the DTPs
Patent Office, which includes the Designs
Registry and the Trade Marks Registry. The
Patent Office is also involved with the
international harmonisation of rules and
procedures and with modernising and
simplifying intellectual property law. Patent
protection is available under the European
Patent Convention and the Patent Co¬
operation Treaty; trade mark registration is
available through a Community Trade Mark.
Rights may be established in other countries
by virtue of separate conventions on industrial
property, literary and artistic work, and music
and broadcasting.
Education and Training
Business can only compete successfully in
rapidly changing world markets by employing a
flexible, highly skilled and highly qualified
workforce. The Government is committed to
increasing investment in education and training
(see chapters 12 and 26), and is also planning to
establish a University for Industry through a
public/private partnership. This will:
• help adults improve their skills and
realise their potential;
• improve the quality and accessibility of
learning opportunities by applying new
technology; and
• supply small businesses with trained
personnel and consultancy and other
services.
194
INDUSTRY
Recent measures to raise standards in
education and training include:
• improved careers information, education
and guidance for young people;
• a strengthening of academic and
vocational qualifications;
• modern apprenticeships;
• initiatives to help firms develop and
implement training plans;
• making training loans available to smaller
firms; and
• a competition open to small firms for the
best co-ordinated training projects.
Training and Enterprise Councils and Local
Enterprise Companies
Training schemes are available through a
network of 79 business-led Training and
Enterprise Councils (TECs) in England and
Wales and 22 local enterprise companies (LECs)
in Scotland, run by Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (see p. 197).
TECs and LECs are independent companies
managed by boards of directors, the majority of
whom are drawn from private sector business.
They provide training, vocational education and
enterprise programmes on behalf of the
Government and encourage employers to
develop the potential of all their employees
through, for instance, attainment of the Investors
in People standard (see p. 175). In addition, they
offer advisory and training services to businesses,
including schemes to enhance the expertise of
managers. In Scotland, LECs supply the full
range of services offered by the enterprise
bodies—support and advice to businesses,
environmental renewal, training programmes for
young and long-term unemployed people and
encouragement to businesses to invest in
management and skills. TECs and LECs also
have a key role in regeneration and economic
development activities locally.
Management Education and Development
Management education is available at most
universities and colleges of higher and further
education. Regional management centres have
been established in England and Wales by
associations of these colleges, and there are
several similar organisations in Scotland.
Universities run full-time postgraduate
programmes at business schools, such as those
of London, Manchester, Durham, Warwick
and Strathclyde universities.
The British Institute of Management
encourages excellence in management. Other
bodies are concerned with standards and
training in specialised branches of
management. The employer-led Management
Charter Initiative (MCI) is the operating arm
of the National Forum for Management
Education and Development and the leading
industrial body for management standards.
Business Support Services
Government business support services
comprise a number of different schemes
delivered via a variety of mechanisms. These
schemes are intended to support a range of
objectives, including improved business
performance, employment creation, increased
exports and environmental improvements.
Some schemes provide grants, but the main
emphasis is on the provision of advice and
guidance, with the aim of improving the
underlying capabilities of firms. Since the
main customers for business support services
are small and medium-sized enterprises, local
delivery is preferred wherever possible. In
many cases, the Government’s role is simply
to provide a framework within which business
people can share expertise and help one
another.
The main mechanism for delivering
services in England is a network of 300
Business Links, which bring together in a
single point of access organisations supporting
enterprise, such as TECs, chambers of
commerce, local authorities and enterprise
agencies. Business Links are local, commercial
partnerships, in which larger firms can make
contacts and expertise available to smaller
firms. Over 500 personal business advisers
offer small firms a full complement of
consultancy and other services, calling on
about 150 specialist counsellors for export
development, design, and innovation and
technology. In addition, regional staff from
three government departments (Trade and
Industry, Education and Employment, and
195
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Environment, Transport and the Regions),
seconded to Business Links, provide advice
and guidance especially on government
support.
Examples of the sorts of services provided
are help in using modern technologies, such as
the Internet, World Wide Web and e-mail;
and a regional supply network, designed to
help both purchasers find competitive
suppliers and suppliers exploit new markets.
Best management practice activities are also
promoted, such as:
• the national UK Benchmark Index,
which allows small firms to compare their
performance with other local companies,
in order to identify their strengths and
weaknesses;
• a CD-ROM-based package of
presentation material to enable Business
Links to highlight management best
practice; and
• a company visit programme which
enables companies to see world-class
practices at first hand.
To give greater discretion to the Business
Links and their partner organisations in the
design and delivery of services to businesses,
central DTI programmes have been reduced
and the funding channels simplified, with
support being brought together into one local
competitiveness budget. In addition, a new
government/private sector funding scheme,
Local Challenge, has been set up in England,
which makes finance available to the most
effective partnership projects. A separate
DTI-managed national Sector Challenge with
similar funding has also been introduced for
projects in specific sectors of industry, with
priority being given to small and medium¬
sized enterprises.
In Scotland, Business Shops are run by
local partnerships between LECs, local
authorities and business support
organisations; trained advisers supply
information and direct enquiries to the
business support services of local partners.
Similar arrangements have been set up in
Wales through Business Connect, which has a
network of business support centres. In
Northern Ireland small firms are helped by
the Local Enterprise Development Unit’s
network of regional offices, which provide co¬
ordinated advice and support.
Consultancy
Business Links are responsible for supplying a
flexible consultancy and diagnostic service,
which gives assessments of smaller firms’
strengths and weaknesses and draws up plans
for their future development. A parallel service
is available in Scotland through Business Shops
in lowland Scotland and Business Information
Source in the Highlands and Islands area.
Small and medium-sized companies can also
use a consultancy brokerage service to assist
them in selecting consultants.
Small Firms Schemes
Financial help is available for small and
medium-sized firms to undertake innovation
activities under the new SMART scheme (see
p. 330). Other government assistance on offer
to smaller businesses includes:
• the Small Firms Loan Guarantee
Scheme, which helps businesses with
viable proposals to obtain finance where
conventional loans are unavailable as a
result of a lack of financial security or
previous performance; the scheme gives
banks and other financial institutions a
government guarantee on a certain
percentage of the loan in return for a
premium payment; about 6,490 loans
valued at £255 million were guaranteed
in 1996-97;
• a programme to encourage small and
medium-sized firms to make better use of
new information technology; and
• an initiative allowing small firms to
develop key workers’ training skills
in-house.
Regional Industrial Development
Regional policy is designed to encourage
investment in economic development and
regeneration in all areas of Britain. Where
additional help is needed, it is focused on the
Assisted Areas (Development Areas and
196
INDUSTRY
Intermediate Areas), which cover around 35
per cent of Britain’s working population. The
promotion of inward investment is a key
element in the Government’s regional policy
(see p. 198).
The main instrument of DTI support to
industry in the Assisted Areas is Regional
Selective Assistance (RSA), which is designed to:
• help create and safeguard jobs;
• help attract international investment;
• improve regional and local
competitiveness; and
• help areas adversely affected by the
impact of economic change.
In 1996-97, each £1 million RSA grant
attracted £11 million of capital investment
and directly created or safeguarded an average
of 245 jobs.
England
English Partnerships promotes job creation,
inward investment and environmental
improvement through reclamation and
development of vacant, derelict, under-used or
contaminated land and buildings (see p. 372).
The Rural Development Commission advises
the Government on economic and social
development in the countryside, promotes jobs
and supports essential services. The
Commission’s resources are concentrated in
areas of greatest need, known as Rural
Development Areas, covering about 35 per
cent of the area of England (see p. 374). The
Government intends to establish Regional
Development Agencies and a strategic
authority for London, which will assist in
improving regional competitiveness,
promoting inward investment, helping small
businesses, and co-ordinating economic
development (see p. 371). Due to come into
operation in April 1999, the Agencies will work
with the Government Offices for the Regions,
chambers of commerce, TECs and other
bodies involved in economic development.
Scotland
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise manage government and EU
support to industry and commerce, in lowland
and highland Scotland respectively, operating
mainly through the network of LECs (see p.
175). The two bodies have a broad range of
duties, including:
• promoting industrial efficiency and
competitiveness;
• attracting inward investment and
encouraging exports;
• giving financial and management support
to new' businesses and helping existing
ones to expand;
• improving the environment by
reclaiming derelict and contaminated
land; and
• increasing job opportunities and skills.
A Scottish Enterprise-initiated Scottish
Equity Partnership fund is designed to
improve access to finance for smaller
companies. Involving both Scottish Enterprise
and private investors, the fund provides
venture and development capital for start-ups,
early-stage investments, management buy¬
outs/buy-ins and mature businesses seeking to
expand.
Wales
The purposes of the Welsh Development
Agency (WDA—see p. 31) are to further the
economic development, promote industrial
efficiency and improve the environment of
Wales. In conjunction with the private sector,
it provides affordable, high-quality sites and
premises for existing businesses and inward
investors. It encourages private sector
investments (through its Welsh Property
Venture), as well as investment from outside
Wales. The WDA’s land reclamation
programme is the largest and most sustained
landscape improvement project in Europe. Its
Business Development division focuses on
developing stronger regional clusters (such as
supply and services chains), increasing
standards and efficiency, and helping Welsh
companies to exploit new technology.
The Land Authority for Wales is a public
body with a fundamental role in economic
regeneration. It works with the private and
public sectors, making available land for urban
197
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
development, employment and affordable
housing (see p. 375). The Development Board
for Rural Wales promotes the economic and
social well-being of rural mid-Wales. It
concentrates investment in market towns,
especially those in the west, in order to help
stimulate business confidence and prosperity.
Priority is also being given to activities in
smaller communities.
Northern Ireland
Industrial development policy in Northern
Ireland is the responsibility of the Department
of Economic Development (see p. 535) and is
implemented through various agencies:
• the Industrial Development Board,
which deals with overseas companies
considering Northern Ireland as an
investment location, as well as the
development of local companies with
more than 50 employees;
• the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which promotes enterprise and the
development of small businesses;
• the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, providing advice and assistance on
research and development, innovation
and technology transfer; and
• the Training and Employment Agency
(see p. 177), which helps with in-company
training and management development.
A variety of schemes are on offer to help
companies with marketing, exporting, product
development and design, improving
productivity and quality, training, and
research and development. A full range of
assistance is available to those companies able
to demonstrate development potential and the
prospect of long-term competitive growth.
This assistance includes capital grants, loans
and share capital investment.
Inward Investment
Inward investment is increasingly important
to the economy, with around £154,000 million
currently invested from overseas; in 1996
alone, some £21,000 million of inward direct
investment came to Britain.
Britain is second only to the United States
as the destination for international direct
investment, which helps to develop and
modernise the industrial base by introducing
new products and processes, as well as
bringing in management expertise. It also
provides new jobs and boosts output, exports
and tax revenues.
Britain is the EU’s major location for
inward investment from North America and
the Asia Pacific region, attracting about 40 per
cent of investment from these areas. For the
prospective inward investor Britain’s strengths
include its membership of the single European
market, a flexible and adaptable workforce,
good labour relations, low corporate and
personal taxation, a respected legal system,
and the English language.
A growing proportion of inward investment
has been through expansion or reinvestment
by existing investors. The DTI’s Invest in
Britain Bureau (IBB) and its regional partners
give high priority to supporting these, to
ensure that they are aware of the advantages of
remaining and expanding in Britain. Overall
policy and co-ordination of overseas
promotion of inward investment are the
responsibility of the IBB, which represents
Britain as a whole. It is supported in Britain
by several territorial and regional bodies, and
overseas it operates through British
Embassies, High Commissions and
Consulates-General.
Similar advice and assistance to that
provided in England by regional development
organisations (to be replaced by the Regional
Development Agencies in 1999) is available
through:
• Locate in Scotland, operated jointly by the
Scottish Office and Scottish Enterprise;
• the Welsh Office Industry and Training
Department and the Welsh Development
Agency’s International Division; and
• the Industrial Development Board in
Northern Ireland.
European Union Regional Policy and Aid
The EU seeks to reduce disparities between
the different regions of the Union. The
198
INDUSTRY
principal responsibility for helping poorer
areas remains with national authorities, but
the EU complements schemes by awarding
grants and loans from various sources,
including the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF).
EU Structural Funds, especially the
ERDF, play an important role in regional
development. Three areas—Northern Ireland,
the Highlands and Islands, and Merseyside—
are eligible for assistance under ‘Objective F,
which aims to promote the development of
regions lagging behind; they are receiving
around £1,900 million of EU funding over the
period 1997-99. The ERDF also provides
Further Reading
finance for areas of industrial decline and for
rural development. Structural Funds are also
available to help areas previously dependent
on the coal, steel, textile, fishing and defence
industries and to create employment and
secure jobs through training.
The European Investment Bank (see p.
127) offers loans for public and private capital
investment schemes. Assisted projects
typically include improvements to and
building of infrastructure projects;
construction of trans-European transport
links; support for business and tourism
development; and capital investment in
industry, such as factory construction.

Commercial Policy 205 Balance of Payments 209
Overseas trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for
hundreds of years. With only about 1 per cent of the world’s population, Britain
is the fifth largest trading nation, accounting for around 5 per cent of world
trade in goods and services. As a member of the European Union (EU), it is part
of the world’s largest established trading group, responsible for 40 per cent of
world exports. In 1996 Britain had its lowest deficit on the current account of
the balance of trade since 1985. The surplus on trade in services was the highest
recorded. The deficit on trade in goods, however, has grown slightly since 1994,
although it is falling as a percentage of total trade.
The Government wants to see an enlarged and more effective EU, and will
work towards breaking down remaining barriers to competition in the single
European market. With a higher degree of inward and outward investment than
any other leading economy, relative to gross domestic product (GDP), Britain is
taking advantage of increasing global free trade. It will encourage the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) to take further action to reduce non-tariff barriers
and to open up world financial markets.
Britain exports more per head than the United
States and Japan. Its overseas sales of goods
and services are equivalent to about a quarter
of GDP. Re-exporting plays a prominent role
in trade. Receipts from trade in services and
investment income make up about half of its
total overseas earnings, and Britain
consistently runs large surpluses on these
accounts. It is the world’s second biggest
overseas investor and the leading destination
for inward direct investment into the EU.
British investors have more overseas direct
investments than foreign firms have in
Britain.' The financial services sector plays a
key role in both services and investment
income, achieving net overseas earnings of
£6,400 million on services and £9,700 million
from overseas investments in 1996.
World trade is set to grow by 5 to 10 per
cent a year in the next ten years, due in part to
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round of negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in
1993. This led to the creation in 1995 of the
1 Overseas direct investment consists of investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies, giving the investor a
significant influence over the operations of the company. The
other main type of overseas investment is known as portfolio
investment; it consists of investment in the securities of overseas-
registered companies and governments and does not entitle the
investor to any significant influence over company operations (see
Table 14.8). "

TRADE IN GOODS
In 1996 Britain’s exports of goods were valued
at about £166,340 million and imports at
£178,938 million on a balance of payments
basis (see Table 14.1). Between 1995 and 1996
the volume of exports of goods rose by 7 per
cent and their value by 9 per cent. Over the
same period, imports grew by 9 per cent in
terms of both volume and value.
Britain traditionally used to be an exporter of
manufactured goods and an importer of food
and basic materials. In 1970 manufactures
accounted for 84 per cent of its exports; this
fell to around 66 per cent by the mid-1980s as
North Sea oil exports increased their share.
The proportion of manufactures in exports
has since risen, to 84 per cent in 1996 (see
Table 14.2). Britain has not, however, had a
surplus on manufactures since 1982.
Machinery and transport equipment account
for about 44 per cent of exports and 42 per

cent of imports (see Table 14.3). Aerospace,
chemicals and electronics have become
increasingly significant export sectors, while
textiles have declined in relative importance.
Britain is Europe’s biggest exporter of
computers, television sets and microchips;
many of the firms involved are large
multinationals from the Far East and the
United States.
Since the mid-1970s North Sea oil has
made a substantial contribution to Britain’s
overseas trade in terms of both exports and
import substitution. In 1996 exports of fuels
in volume terms were nearly six times their
1975 level, while imports were around three-
fifths of the 1975 figure. The share of fuels in
exports was 7 per cent in 1996, while the
import share had fallen from 17 per cent in
203
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
1975 to 4 per cent by 1996. In 1996 the
surplus on trade in oil amounted to nearly
£4,300 million on a balance of payments basis.
Imported manufactures have taken a
greater share of the domestic market in recent
decades. Between 1970 and 1996 the share of
finished manufactures in total imports rose
from 25 to 56 per cent, while the share of basic
materials fell from 15 to 4 per cent. The
percentage of food, beverages and tobacco in
total imports has been dropping since the
1950s, down to 9 per cent in 1996, as a result
both of the extent to which food demand has
been met from domestic agriculture and of the
decline in the proportion of total expenditure
on food.
Geographical Distribution
Britain’s overseas trade is mainly with other
developed countries. Other countries in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) took 82 per cent of
Britain’s exports in 1996 and supplied 83 per
cent of imports. In 1972, the year before
Britain joined the European Community (as
the EU was then known), 43 per cent of its
trade in goods was with the other 14 countries
which presently make up the EU. The
proportion rose to 56 per cent in 1996.
Western Europe as a whole took 62 per cent of
British exports in 1996. In 1996 EU countries
accounted for eight of Britain’s top ten export
markets and seven of the ten leading suppliers
of goods to Britain (see Table 14.4). In 1990
Germany overtook the United States to
become Britain’s biggest overseas market for
goods; Germany is also Britain’s largest single
supplier. In 1996 it took 12 per cent of
Britain’s exports and supplied nearly 15 per
cent of its imports.
There have been a number of other changes
in the pattern of Britain’s overseas trade in
recent years. Exports to Japan, which is
presently Britain’s tenth largest export
market, rose by 13 per cent by value in 1996,

while Japan is Britain’s fifth largest supplier,
accounting for 5 per cent of imports. There
were substantial increases in Britain’s exports to
a number of other markets in Asia in 1996,
including Thailand (up by 17 per cent), South
Korea (by 13 per cent) and Hong Kong (by 10
per cent), while exports to Saudi Arabia rose by
51 per cent.
OTHER TRANSACTIONS
Other transactions fall into three main groups:
internationally tradeable services; investment
income on external assets; and non-commercial
transfers (chiefly between governments,
between the British Government and EU
organisations, and between private individuals).
Services range from banking, insurance and
stockbroking, tourism, and shipping and aviation
to specialist services such as engineering
consultancy, computer programming and
training. Financial services make a major
contribution to overseas earnings: net overseas
receipts from services rendered were £6,397
million in 1996. Earnings from trade in services
as a whole rose by 9 per cent in 1996 to £50,807
million (see Table 14.5). There was an overall
surplus on services of £7,142 million,
compared with £6,877 million in 1995.
Earnings on investment income increased by
5 per cent to £96,071 million in 1996, while
debits rose by 4 per cent to £86,419 million (see
Table 14.6). The surplus on investment income
was £9,652 million. Within this, there were
surpluses on earnings from direct investment of
£12,889 million and from portfolio investment
of £3,854 million, although these were partly
offset by a deficit on bank borrowing and
lending. Transfers have almost always been in
deficit, amounting to £4,631 million in
1996—with a deficit on government transfers
of £4,933 million and a surplus on private
sector transfers of £302 million.
COMMERCIAL POLICY
Government policy seeks to promote an open
multilateral trading system and the further
205
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
liberalisation of world trade. To this end,
Britain has taken a leading part in the activities
of such organisations as the WTO, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
OECD, as well as the EU.
European Union
The single European market ‘opened for
business’ in 1993, with the essential legislation
in place for the free movement of goods,
services, people and capital within the EU.
There has been:
• abolition of exchange controls;
• ending of routine customs clearance of
commercial goods at national frontiers
within the EU;
• creation of common technical standards;
• introduction of the right to trade
financial services throughout the EU on
the basis of a single home authorisation
‘passport’ (see p. 235); and
• deregulation of airlines, with no preferential
treatment for national flag carriers.
Efforts are now being made to enhance the
effectiveness of the single market through the
European Commission’s Single Market Action
Plan. Among the issues on which the plan
focuses are enforcement; simplification;
liberalisation of financial services,
telecommunications and energy markets;
opening up of public procurement; and
mutual recognition of national arrangements
for testing and certification of goods where
there are no EC rules. The Department of
Trade and Industry’s (DTPs) Action Single
Market team helps companies that encounter
illegal barriers to trade to overcome them and
also pursues complaints about illegal state
aids The British Government supports efforts
to extend the single market to those countries
of Central and Eastern Europe which are
applying for EU membership.
World Trade Organisation
The eighth GATT round—the Uruguay
Round—was launched in 1986 and successfully
concluded in 1993. It was the biggest ever
multilateral trade negotiation and established
the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as
successor to the GATT at the beginning of
1995. There are currently 130 WTO members,
and over 30 countries are negotiating their
accession.
The WTO incorporates the GATT, which
covers trade in goods and agreements in a
number of other areas, including agriculture,
services, textiles, intellectual property,
subsidies, technical barriers to trade, and
trade-related investment measures. A new
binding dispute settlement procedure was also
agreed, ensuring that the WTO rules are
applied and enforced.
Overall tariff reductions achieved during
the Uruguay Round amount to about 40 per
cent across all countries. Members also agreed
not to raise tariffs again on 95 per cent of
world trade. The Information Technology
Agreement signed in March 1997 will result in
the phasing out of tariffs on information
technology products by 2000; this could
ultimately mean gains for Britain of £1,900
million a year. In February 1997 a substantial
liberalisation package was concluded in
telecommunications services, with 69
countries (representing over 91 per cent of the
world telecommunications market)
guaranteeing access to their markets. Britain
supports all the WTO’s agreements, its
dispute settlement system and moves to
reduce both tariff and non-tariff barriers that
still remain through the multilateral system; a
particular priority is to conclude negotiations
to further liberalise trade in financial services
by the end of 1997.
The first WTO Ministerial Conference,
held in Singapore in December 1996,
reaffirmed the primacy of the multilateral
system and confirmed the commitment by all
WTO members to implementing in full the
Uruguay Round agreements. New work on
government procurement, trade facilitation,
trade and competition, and trade and
investment was agreed.
Britain’s priorities for the WTO’s work
programme include:
• further tariff reductions;
• improved respect for intellectual
property rights;
206
OVERSEAS TRADE
• liberalising public procurement rules;
• removing technical barriers to trade;
• simplification of trade procedures for
imports and exports;
• simplification and harmonisation of
preferential rules of origin; and
• tighter disciplines on state subsidies.
Bilateral Relations
Britain places great importance on developing
strong relations with third countries, in
particular through the EU. One example of
this is the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), an
inter-regional forum set up in 1996, which
Britain sees as providing opportunities to
encourage further efforts towards trade
liberalisation among ASEM’s 25 member
countries, including the newly industrialising
countries in Asia. Britain will be hosting the
second ASEM Summit in London in April
1998. Relations with the United States are
enhanced through the EU-US Action Plan,
which encourages co-operation on a number
of issues, including trade.
Special Trading Arrangements
The multilateral trading system provides the
foundation for the EU’s common commercial
policy. However, the EU has preferential
trading arrangements with a number of
countries. These fall into three main
categories:
• Those that prepare countries in Central
and Eastern Europe for possible EU
membership. Europe Agreements have
been signed between the EU and Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania. They are designed
to facilitate closer political and economic
ties and the eventual liberalisation of trade
with a view to these countries becoming
full members of the EU. Interim
Agreements are in place with Slovenia and
the three Baltic states until their Europe
Agreements are ratified. A trade and
economic co-operation agreement has also
been made with Albania.
• Those that provide an economic
dimension to wider agreements with
neighbouring countries. The EU has
association and co-operation agreements
with virtually all non-member countries
with a Mediterranean coastline, plus
Jordan. These provide preferential access
to EU markets on a reciprocal basis.
• Those that provide an economic
dimension to its assistance to former
dependent territories. Trade relations
with these countries (known as ACP
countries—African, Caribbean and
Pacific) are governed by the Lome
Convention, which gives them tariff-free
access, subject to certain safeguards, to
the EU for industrial and agricultural
products. The EU also operates a
Generalised System of Preferences
(GSP), which is available to nearly all
developing countries. This applies to
industrial products, including textiles
and certain (mainly processed)
agricultural products.
Partnership and co-operation (non-
preferential agreements) have been concluded
with ten states of the former Soviet Union.
Non-preferential co-operation agreements have
also been made with countries in South Asia
and Latin America, as well as with the People’s
Republic of China, the Association of South
East Asian Nations, the Andean Pact, and the
Organisation of Central American States.
CONTROLS ON TRADE
With the completion of the single European
market, all routine internal border controls
and requirements were removed for trade in
EU goods between the members of the EU.
This has substantially cut travel times and
costs; for example, freight journey times by
road from Britain to Italy have been reduced
by up to 24 hours.
Import Controls
Following the completion of the single
European market, all national quantitative
restrictions have been abolished. However,
some EU-wide quotas have been imposed on a
207
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
small range of non-textile and clothing
products from the People’s Republic of China,
while EU imports of some steel products from
Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan are also
restricted. Quantitative restrictions on textiles
and clothing stem from the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA), under which there is a
series of bilateral agreements. Some quotas are
also maintained for imports from non-WTO
countries. The MFA restrictions will be
eliminated by 2005 as part of the WTO
agreement.
Imports from certain countries remain
subject to sanctions or embargo agreed by, for
example, the United Nations. Imports of
certain other goods from all countries are
prohibited or restricted to protect human,
animal or plant life and health. These include
firearms and ammunition; nuclear materials;
certain drugs; explosives; endangered wildlife
and derived products; and certain agricultural,
horticultural and food products.
Export Controls
The great majority of British exports are not
subject to any government control. Controls
on certain strategic goods are, though,
imposed for a variety of reasons, including
foreign policy and non-proliferation concerns,
the need to comply with international treaty
commitments, the operation of sanctions and
national security. The scope of export controls
is limited to what is necessary to meet these
concerns. Most controls apply on a worldwide
basis, although certain sanctions and
embargoes are applied against specific
countries as a result of agreement by members
of bodies such as the United Nations.
There are controls relating to the export of
conventional military goods, arms,
ammunition and related materials as well as
dual-use industrial goods that can be used for
civil and military purposes. Most dual-use
industrial goods are allowed to move within
the EU without an export licence. Britain
works with the other members of the
Wassenaar Arrangement to promote
transparency and greater responsibility in the
transfer of conventional weapons and dual-use
goods and technologies. Two lists of goods are
in place. Lists of controls on certain dual-use
related goods are also agreed by members of
the Australia Group, the Nuclear Suppliers
Group and the Missile Technology Control
Regime; Britain is a member of all three. The
aim of these groups is to help prevent the
spread of chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons and missile systems for their
delivery. In July 1997 the British Government
issued new criteria for a responsible arms
trade (see p. 134).
SERVICES FOR EXPORTERS
The Government provides a wide range of
advice and practical support to meet the needs
of exporters. This support is designed to help
businesses, especially small and medium-sized
enterprises, through all stages of the exporting
process.
Export Promotion Services
The DTI and the FCO provide support
through the joint Overseas Trade Services
(OTS) operation. OTS has a network of some
2,000 staff worldwide to help British
businesses compete successfully throughout
the world. In 1997-98 over £200 million is
being spent on support for exporters.
The network comprises country help desks,
whose staff include export promoters
seconded from industry, and other teams
providing export information services in the
DTFs headquarters in London; the
commercial sections at more than 200 FCO
diplomatic posts overseas; over 70 Business
Links throughout England (see p. 195);
Scottish Trade International; Welsh Office
Overseas Trade Services; and the Industrial
Development Board for Northern Ireland.
Services include export intelligence, market
information, help in researching potential
markets and finding partners, and support for
firms participating in trade fairs and missions.
The Oil, gas and petrochemicals Supplies
Office (OSO—see p. 264) provides
information On oil and gas markets and
projects around the world.
For companies based in England local
Business Links are usually the first point of
contact for firms requiring OTS services.
International trade teams at the Business Link
208
OVERSEAS TRADE
can offer specialist help from their export
development counsellors and from seconded
DTI export staff. Elsewhere in Britain access
is via the export sections in the relevant home
country department.
The Government’s trade promotion policy
is guided by advice from businessmen and
women who serve on the British Overseas
Trade Board. Its Area Advisory Groups,
consisting of business people with expert
knowledge of trade with particular world
markets, provide advice on the world’s main
trading areas. The Overseas Project Board
advises on major project business overseas, and
the Small Firms Committee gives guidance on
matters relating to small businesses.
British Invisibles
British Invisibles is an organisation which
promotes the international activities of
financial institutions and business services. Its
role is to suggest and, where possible,
implement measures for boosting such
earnings in Britain and abroad. It also seeks to
increase awareness of London as an
international financial centre and of the role of
the service sector in the British economy.
Export Insurance
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) is a government department
responsible to the President of the Board of
Trade, the minister heading the DTI. It helps
British firms overcome many of the risks of
selling and investing overseas. ECGD
supports British exporters of capital goods and
services usually sold on medium- and long¬
term credit by:
• guaranteeing exporters and financing
banks against the risk of non-payment by
overseas buyers/borrowers;
• giving interest rate support to British
banks, allowing overseas borrowers access
to funds at fixed, often favourable, rates
of interest; and
• providing reinsurance to private sector
insurance companies covering British
exports sold on short-term credit.
In order to encourage investment in less
developed countries, ECGD also insures
investment earnings against the main political
risks, such as war, expropriation and
restrictions on repatriation of profits.
ECGD has cover available for over 125
markets worldwide. The Asia-Pacific region
is currently its largest source of new
business.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The balance of payments statistics record
transactions between residents of Britain and
non-residents. The transactions are classified
into two groups: current account, and
transactions in Britain’s external assets and
liabilities, sometimes known as the capital
account. The current account records trade in
goods and services, including finance, tourism
and transport; transactions in investment
income; and transfers. Capital transactions
include inward and outward investment,
overseas transactions by banks in Britain,
external borrowing and lending by residents in
Britain, and drawings on and accruals to the
official reserves.
Britain has no exchange controls; residents
are free to acquire foreign currency for any
purpose, including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. There are also no
controls on the lending of sterling abroad, and
non-residents can acquire sterling for any
purpose. Gold may be freely bought and sold.
Exchange controls were abolished in 1979,
and Britain meets in full its obligations on
capital movements under an OECD code and
under EC directives.
Britain’s balance of payments current
account has been in deficit since 1986,
although the deficit recorded in 1996 was the
lowest since 1985, at £435 million (see Table
14.7), representing less than 1 per cent of
GDP. Since 1983 Britain has had a deficit on
trade in goods, and this amounted to
£12,598 million in 1996. However, it has
almost always run large surpluses on trade in
services and investment income, in 1996 the
surplus on services rose by £265 million and
that on investment income by £1,732
million, while the deficit on transfers fell by
£2,256 million.

Inward and Outward Investment
The Government welcomes both outward and
inward investment. Outward investment helps
to develop markets for British exports while
providing earnings in the form of investment
income. Inward investment is promoted by
the Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB), which
reports jointly to the DTI and the FCO—see
p. 198. This investment is seen as a means of
introducing new technology, products and
management styles; creating or safeguarding
employment; and increasing exports (around
90 per cent of inward investors export from
their British base) or substituting imports.
The IBB was notified of 483 new inward
investment projects from 26 countries in
1996-97, which are^expected to create or
safeguard 94,000 jobs. Inward investment is
playing an increasingly important role in
Britain’s economy, with overseas firms
providing 19 per cent of all manufacturing
jobs, 26 per cent of net output, 30 per cent of
manufacturing investment and about 40 per
cent of manufacturing exports. At present,
Britain has over 40 per cent of US and
Japanese and over 50 per cent of South
Korean and Taiwanese investment in the EU.
Inward investment has benefited a range of
industries, including telecommunications and
210
OVERSEAS TRADE
the information sector, electronics, medical
equipment, pharmaceuticals, financial
services, food and drink, and the automotive
industry. The single European market and
relatively low taxation are among the most
frequently quoted reasons for locating in
Britain.
At the end of 1996 the stock of inward
direct investment (investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies which
gives the investor an effective role in their
management) was around £154,000 million.
The stock of direct investment overseas by
British residents was £214,600 million at the
end of 1996. The stock of overseas portfolio
investment in Britain amounted to nearly
Further Reading
£351,000 million at the end of 1996, while the
stock of British portfolio investment overseas
was £517,000 million. An analysis of
transactions in Britain’s external assets and
liabilities for 1994-96 is given in Table 14.8.
Britain’s identified external assets at the end of
1996 exceeded liabilities by nearly £5,000
million.
At the end of 1995, 86 per cent of outward
direct investment was in developed countries,
with 40 per cent in the United States and 37
per cent in the EU. Investment from
developed countries accounted for over 97 per
cent of overseas direct investment in Britain:
68 per cent originated in the United States
and 30 per cent in the EU.

15 Manufacturing and
Construction
Introduction 212 Construction 229
Sectors of Manufacturing 212
Britain became the world’s first industrialised country in the mid-19th century.
Wealth was based on manufacturing iron and steel, heavy machinery and
cotton textiles, and on coalmining, shipbuilding and trade. Manufacturing
continues to play an important role in the modern economy. Britain excels in
high-technology industries such as chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals,
electronics, motor vehicles and components, aerospace, offshore equipment,
and paper and printing, where British companies are among the world’s largest
and most successful. Britain’s construction industry has made its mark around
the world and continues to be involved
international building projects.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for about 21 per
cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996
and for 18 per cent of employment. More than
four-fifths of visible exports consisted of
manufactured or semi-manufactured goods.
Almost all manufacturing is carried out by
private sector businesses. Overseas companies
are responsible for one-third of manufacturing
investment in Britain, nearly one-fifth of
manufacturing employment, a quarter of net
output and two-fifths of exports.
The recession in the early 1990s led to a
serious decline in manufacturing output, but it
began to rise again in 1993 and by 1996 was
2.8 per cent above the 1990 level (see Table
15.2). Employment in manufacturing in 1996
was 4.1 million. Total capital investment was
X 15,388 million.
The construction industry contributes
around 5 per cent of GDP and provides
employment for some 800,000 people.
Following a period of marked decline as
recession affected the industry in the early
in some of the most prestigious
1990s, output has picked up slightly since
1993 while remaining some way below pre¬
recession levels. Total domestic fixed capital
investment was £1,165 million in 1996, 42 per
cent higher than the figure for the previous
year.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of enterprises and the main
sectors are shown in Tables 15.1 and 15.2.
Table 15.3 indicates output and investment. A
more detailed description of some of the main
sectors is given below.
Food and Drink
Britain has a comprehensive food and drink
manufacturing industry, which has accounted
for a growing proportion of total domestic
food supply since the 1940s; it achieved export
sales of £10,100 million in 1996. One of the
country’s biggest manufacturing industries in
terms of output, it employs approximately

430,000 people in over 8,200 enterprises, most
of which are small to medium-sized
companies. The greatest concentration of
firms is to be found in the production of
bread, cakes and fresh pastry goods, followed
by those engaged in processing and preserving
fruit and vegetables. The south east of
England provides the greatest number of
food-based jobs (15 per cent of the total);
other areas with large numbers of such jobs
are Yorkshire and Humberside and north-west

Scotland the highest concentration of
employment in the drinks manufacturing
industry (27 per cent of the total), with large
numbers of jobs in economically deprived

rural areas; south-east England has the second
highest concentration (19 per cent) of drinks-
related jobs.
In the last few years, productivity has
increased and the food and drink
manufacturing industry has undergone
restructuring, partly in order to take advantage
of the single European market. By far the
biggest export category is alcoholic drinks,
which account for nearly a third of the value of
total food and drink sales overseas. The Scotch
whisky industry is one of Britain’s top export
earners, with overseas sales worth £2,300
million in 1996. Export performance in the
food and non-alcoholic beverages sectors is
strongest in the areas of milk and cream,
biscuits, chocolate and sugar confectionery, tea
processing, farm animal feeds and pet food.
Among the biggest companies involved in
food manufacturing and processing are
Unilever, Northern Foods, Unigate,
Hillsdown Holdings, Tate and Lyle, Cadbury
Schweppes, Associated British Foods, and
United Biscuits. Guinness, Grand
Metropolitan and Allied Domecq are three of
the world’s top four alcoholic drinks
companies. Alongside these large concerns,
there is a thriving specialist food and drink
sector made up of hundreds of small firms
supplying high-quality ‘niche’ products, often
to small retail outlets, such as delicatessens.
Frozen foods and chilled convenience
foods, such as frozen potato products and
ready-prepared meals, salads and pasta,
together with yogurts, desserts and ‘instant
snacks’, have formed some of the fastest-
growing sectors of the food market in recent
years. The range of ready-cooked meals is
expanding rapidly, and includes international
cuisine. Companies have introduced many
new low-fat and fat-free items, ranging from
dairy products to complete prepared meals, in
order to meet growing consumer health
concerns. There has also been a rise in sales of
vegetarian foods (both natural vegetable dishes
and vegetable-based substitutes of meat
products, where soya plays an ever bigger
role). Genetically modified foods and drinks
with improved consistency of quality and,
allegedly, taste are being gradually introduced
onto the market, although public acceptance
of them is far from certain.
Around 40 per cent of liquid milk in Britain
is distributed through a doorstep delivery
system employing about 22,500 people; the
proportion is, however, declining. Household
214
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
milk consumption per head—1.85 litres (3.25
pints) a week—is among the highest in the
world. Consumption of skimmed and semi-
skimmed milk continues to rise as people seek
to reduce the fat content in their diet. Milk for
manufacturing purposes goes principally into
butter, cheese, condensed milk, dried whole
and skimmed milk powder, cream and other
products such as yogurt. The British dairy
industry accounts for around two-thirds of
butter and cheese supplies to the domestic
market and achieves significant sales in
overseas markets.
More than three-quarters of bread is
produced in large bakeries. A steady growth in
the varieties available, greater awareness of the
nutritional value of bread and the growth of
the sandwich market have helped stabilise
consumption in the last few years. Sales of
ready-made sandwiches are now worth an
estimated £2,000 million a year. Exports of
biscuits were valued at £287 million in 1996
and those of chocolate and sugar confectionery
at £567 million.
There are 92 Scotch whisky distilleries in
Scotland, producing either malt whisky or
grain whisky. The raw material of the former
is malt (that is, malted barley) and the latter
other grain mixed with malt. Most Scotch
whisky consumed is a blend of malt and grain
whisky. Examples of well-known brands of
such blended Scotch whisky are J & B,
Johnnie Walker, Chivas Regal, Famous
Grouse, Bell’s and Teacher’s. Some 13,000
people work in the industry and a further
55,000 are employed in associated sectors such
as supplying ingredients and materials. Almost
90 per cent of Scotch whisky production is
exported, the European Union (EU) taking 36
per cent, the United States 12 per cent and
Japan 4 per cent by volume. Gin and vodka
production are also an important part of the
spirits industry. Internationally popular
brands of liqueur made by British firms
include Bailey’s Irish Cream and Drambuie,
made to an old Scottish recipe.
The brewing industry has four major
national brewery groups—Scottish Courage,
Bass, Whitbread and Carlsberg-Tetley—and
about 480 regional and local brewers of beer.
British malt, which is made almost entirely
from home-grown barley, is used by brewers
throughout the world. Demand for traditional
cask-conditioned ales (‘real ale’) remains
steady, while lager now accounts for over half
of all beer sales. In recent years there has been
a shift towards stronger bottled beers, a
significant proportion of which are imported.
Cider is made primarily in south-west
England, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and
Worcestershire.
Some 410 vineyards and 120 wineries,
mainly in southern England, produce an
average of 1.8 million litres of wine a year,
most of which is white. Quality has steadily
improved through the use of new technologies
and winemaking techniques.
The soft drinks industry, which had a
turnover of £6,500 million in 1996, produces
carbonated drinks, concentrates, fruit juices, and
natural mineral and bottled waters. A highly
competitive industry, it is one of the fastest-
growing sectors of the grocery trade, introducing
many innovative products each year.
Tobacco
The British tobacco industry manufactures
nearly all cigarettes and tobacco goods sold in
Britain. Almost all domestic output is
provided by three major manufacturers
(Imperial Tobacco, Gallaher and Carreras
Rothmans). The industry specialises in the
production of high-quality cigarettes made
from flue-cured tobacco, and achieves
significant export sales—£1,200 million in
1996. Europe, the Middle East and Africa are
important markets.
Textiles, Clothing and Footwear
Textiles, clothing and footwear make a
substantial contribution to the British
economy in terms of employment, exports
and annual turnover. They benefit greatly
from the creative talents of British fashion
designers, many of whom have worldwide
reputations. Imports from low-cost nations
have restrained recent production and
employment; nonetheless, together with
leather industries, textiles, clothing and
footwear employ around 360,000 people. The
international Multi-Fibre Arrangement
215
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
(MFA-—see p. 208) allows a measure of
restraint on imports into the EU from low-
cost countries; however, the MFA is being
phased out over ten years to the year 2005.
Increased investment in new machinery and
greater attention to design, training and
marketing have helped to raise
competitiveness. New technologies, largely
designed to improve response times and give
greater flexibility in production, are being
used throughout the industries.
For textiles, there is a high degree of
regional concentration, particularly in the
East Midlands, north-west England, West
Yorkshire, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The clothing industry is scattered throughout
Britain, with significant concentrations in
north-east England, the East Midlands,
south-east England and Scotland. The
principal products are spun yarns, woven and
knitted fabrics, apparel, industrial and
household textiles, and carpets based chiefly
on wool, cotton and synthetic fibres. Exports
of textiles, clothing and footwear totalled
about £6,900 million in 1996.
The textile and clothing industries have
around 14,000 firms, comprising a few
substantial multi-process companies and two
of the world’s major groups—Coats Viyella
and Courtaulds Textiles—as well as a large
number of small and medium-sized firms.
Britain’s wool textile industry is one of the
most important in the world. West Yorkshire
is the main producing area, but Scotland is
also famous as a specialist originator of high-
quality yarns and tweeds. Raw wool is
scoured and cleaned in Britain in preparation
for woollen and worsted spinning and
weaving. (Worsted is fine wool fabric often
used for making suits.) British mills also
process rare fibres such as cashmere and
angora. Low-cost competition has cut
progressively into British markets for cotton
and allied products. Production includes yarn
and fabrics of cotton, synthetic fibres and
cotton-synthetic mixes, with large-scale
dyeing and printing of cotton and synthetic
fibre fabric. The linen industry is centred in
Northern Ireland. The high quality and
variety of design make Britain one of the
world’s leading producers of woven carpets.
Over half the value of carpet and rug output
is made up of tufted carpets. Woven carpets,
mainly Axminster, account for most of the
remaining sales. There is a higher wool
content in woven types, although in these,
too, considerable use is being made of
synthetic fibres.
Industrial textiles account for an increasing
proportion of textile industry output,
covering such items as conveyor belting and
geotextiles used in civil engineering. Many of
these are non-woven. Synthetic
polypropylene yarn is used in the
manufacture of carpet backing and ropes, and
woven into fabrics for a wide range of
applications in the packaging, upholstery,
building and motor vehicle industries. The
British silk industry employs around 4,000
people and produces goods valued at over
£170 million each year.
The clothing industry, with about 8,000
companies, is more labour-intensive than
textiles. While a broad range of clothing is
imported from Europe and Asia, British
industry supplies about one-half of domestic
demand. Exports have risen since the British
fashion designer industry regained
prominence during the 1980s, and traditional
design and high-quality production enable
branded clothing companies such as Daks
Simpson and Jaeger to compete successfully
overseas. The hosiery and knitwear industry
comprises about 1,000 companies, mainly in
the East Midlands and Scotland. The 500
footwear manufacturers, with around 22,000
employees, are predominantly found in
Northamptonshire, Leicestershire and
Lancashire; they include C. & J. Clark,
Church and R. Griggs (makers of the ‘Doc
Martens’ range). Exports of British footwear
exceeded £500 million in 1996.
Paper, Printing and Publishing
There are 97 paper and board mills in Britain,
employing 23,000 people. Among the largest
British groups are Shotton, St Regis and
Bridgewater. Production has been
concentrated in large-scale units to enable the
industry to compete more effectively within
the single European market. Between 1986
and 1996 output increased by almost two-
thirds. Over half the industry is made up of
216
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
forestry product companies from Scandinavia,
North America, Australia and elsewhere.
There has been a significant trend towards
waste-based packaging grades. Usage of
recycled waste paper is increasing and
research is helping to extend it. In 1996 the
total amount of waste paper used in British
newspapers accounted for three-quarters of
newsprint produced. Waste paper provides
over half of the industry’s fibrous raw
materials.
Employment in the paper products,
printing and publishing industries is 440,000.
Much printing and publishing employment
and output is in firms based in south-east
England. Mergers have led to the formation of
large groups in newspaper, magazine and book
publishing. The British book-publishing
industry is a major exporter: in 1996 it
published 101,500 new titles, a 6.8 per cent
rise on 1995; British publishers’ sales within
Britain were worth £1,949 million and their
exports £1,143 million. Security printers (of,
for example, banknotes and postage stamps)
are also important exporters, the major
company being De La Rue.
Chemicals and Related Products
The chemicals industry, which is the fifth
largest in the world, accounts for almost one-
tenth of Britain’s manufacturing output,
making it the country’s fourth largest
manufacturing sector. It provides direct
employment for about 250,000 people working
in 3,900 enterprises. About a half of all the
industry’s employment is divided between
south-east England (especially strong in
pharmaceuticals) and the north west of
England (basic chemical production). Basic
industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals are
the biggest sectors. Products of the chemicals
industry underpin almost all other industrial
processes and output. Sectors include
petrochemicals derived from hydrocarbon
feedstock resources; suppliers to other
manufacturing industries, such as specialised
organic chemicals for pharmaceuticals; and
suppliers of consumer products such as paints,
soaps and detergents.
The industry’s largest markets are plastics
processing, packaging, agriculture, the
National Health Service, and the clothing and
textiles industries. It is at the forefront of
modern technology, spending about 8 per cent
of total sales on research and development
(R & D). Around two-thirds of its output is
exported, making it British manufacturing’s
greatest single export earner. Exports in 1996
were worth around £23,000 million, the
strongest sectors being organic chemicals,
plastics and synthetic rubbers,
pharmaceuticals, soaps and detergents, and
man-made fibres. Imports, mainly consisting
of plastics, pharmaceuticals, photographic
chemical materials and perfumes, were valued
at £18.8 million. Productivity has increased
sharply over the past ten years.
Traditionally, Britain has been a major
producer of basic industrial chemicals, for
example basic organic and inorganic
chemicals, plastics and fertilisers, which
together comprise around a third of output.
The most rapid growth in recent years has,
however, been in pharmaceuticals. The most
important bulk products are ethylene,
propylene and benzene. Britain is one of the
world’s biggest producers of specialised
organic chemicals.
Much inorganic chemical production
consists of relatively simple bulk chemicals,
such as sulphuric acid and metallic and non-
metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for
industry. Speciality chemicals include
pharmaceutical ingredients, essential oils and
flavourings, adhesives and sealants, and
explosives, including those used for car safety
airbags. Investment in environmentally safe
products and processes, for example
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), is
increasing.
Many major chemical companies in Britain
are multinationals; several are subsidiaries of
overseas companies and others are specialist
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, such as
Glaxo Wellcome (see p. 218). Imperial
Chemical Industries (ICI), one of the world’s
biggest chemicals groups, manufactures
industrial chemicals, paints, materials and
explosives. In May 1997, ICI announced its
intention to restructure its operations, which
involved buying Unilever’s specialised
chemicals division and selling its own
industrial chemicals businesses. BOC, the
217
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
industrial gases group, is Britain’s second
largest chemicals company. Zeneca, formerly
part of ICI, produces pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and seeds, and speciality
chemicals. Laporte is Britain’s biggest
speciality chemicals firm.
Teesside, which has been particularly
successful in attracting investment from some
of the leading domestic and overseas chemical
firms, now rivals Rotterdam as Europe’s
largest petrochemicals zone. Grangemouth in
Scotland is also an important petrochemicals
zone. BP and Shell, along with several other
large oil and gas companies, are major
producers of petrochemicals.
The agrochemicals sector invests heavily in
R & D. Notable discoveries include diquat and
paraquat herbicides, pyrethroid insecticides,
systemic fungicides and aphicides, genetically
engineered microbial pesticides and methods
of encouraging natural parasites to eradicate
common pests in horticulture.
Exports of soap and detergent preparations
in 1996 were valued at £673 million. This
sector is dominated by Lever Brothers (part of
Unilever) and Procter and Gamble.
Plastics
About 183,800 people are employed by 5,940
firms involved in the plastics industry.
Regions with the highest concentrations of
employment are south-east England, the West
Midlands and the north west of England.
Total turnover of the industry was about
*£12,000 million in 1996, with exports
reaching £3,300 million. Plastics have a
plethora of applications in the packaging,
building, electrical and electronic, automotive,
medical, furniture and clothing industries.
Britain’s plastic processing industry continues
to be a world leader in material specification
and design, with new processes allowing
stronger plastics to replace other materials or
spread into new applications.
Paints
Sales of paint, varnishes and similar coatings
were worth £2,300 million in 1996. ICI is the
world’s largest paint manufacturer. Among its
products are new ranges of non-drip and
quick-drying paints, and paints needing only
one top coat. Its best-known consumer
product is the ‘Dulux’ paint range. Two of the
more significant innovations have been solid
emulsion paint and a temporary water-based
finish which can be removed easily by
chemical treatment, for vehicle bodies and
road markings.
Pharmaceuticals
The British pharmaceutical industry is the
world’s third biggest exporter of medicines,
accounting for around 10 per cent of the world
market. It manufactures the complete range of
medicinal products—human and veterinary
medicines, medical dressings and dental
materials. In recent times, the largest growth
has been in medicines that act on the
respiratory system, followed by
cardiovascular, muscular and skeletal, anti-
infective and alimentary tract remedies.
Pharmaceutical exports in 1996 reached a
record £5,700 million. The main overseas
markets are Western Europe and North
America, with Japan an expanding market.
Over 400 pharmaceutical manufacturers
and research organisations operate in Britain,
including several British and US parent
multinationals which dominate production
(the biggest 21 firms account for 70 per cent of
production and employment). The three
largest are the British-owned group Glaxo
Wellcome; Zeneca, also British-owned and the
world’s second biggest manufacturer of cancer
therapies; and SmithKline Beecham,
manufacturer of four of the world’s best¬
selling antibiotics. A growing trend is the
production of generic medicines—versions of
branded medicines whose patents have
expired. They are mostly unbranded and
cheaper than the branded originals. More than
50 per cent of prescriptions dispensed by
pharmacists are for generic medicines.
Some 75,000 people work in the industry,
of whom more than a quarter are engaged in
R & D; another 250,000 are employed in
related sectors. The industry, which is largely
based in the south east and north west of
England, invested around £2,000 million in
R & D in 1996. This sum amounts to about one-
fifth of British industry’s R & D. Progress in
218
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
devising vaccines over the last few decades has
helped to reduce dramatically the impact of
infectious diseases such as polio, whooping
cough, mumps and measles. British firms
discovered and developed five of the world’s
20 best-selling medicines, including Glaxo
Wellcome’s ulcer treatment Zantac, in recent
years the world’s best-selling medicine,
SmithKline Beecham’s ulcer treatment
Tagamet, and Zeneca’s beta-blocker
Tenormin, for treating high blood pressure.
Other major developments pioneered in
Britain are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for asthma, arthritis, migraine
and coronary heart disease.
Among Zeneca’s products are Zestril (for
combating high blood pressure), Zoladex (a
prostate cancer therapy) and Diprivan (an
anaesthetic). SmithKline Beecham developed
Augmentin, used to treat a range of infections
that have become resistant to other antibiotics.
It is one of the world’s biggest manufacturers
of vaccines. Glaxo Wellcome’s drug
Zidovudine (AZT) is one of the most widely
used anti-viral agents for the treatment of HIV
infection. Zofran, also produced by Glaxo
Wellcome and one of the company’s most
successful new medicines, is an anti-nausea
drug for countering the unpleasant side-
effects of cancer treatments. British companies
lead in the development of molecular graphics.
These contribute to the design of new and
improved medicines through a computer-
aided technique for analysing the structures of
complicated organic molecules.
Biotechnology
It is estimated that world markets for
biotechnology products could exceed £70,000
million by the year 2000. With one-third of
Europe’s biotechnology firms (around 220 in
total), the British biotechnology industry is
second only to that of the United States,
employing over 10,000 people and achieving
yearly sales of £700 million. As well as
Zeneca, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham, around 40 smaller independent
firms, including British Biotech, Celltech,
Scotia, Chiroscience and Biocompatibles,
contribute to the industry. The most
important sectors include chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, food, agriculture, diagnostics
and environmental clean-up. The industry is
heavily dependent on Britain’s universities’
considerable expertise in biotechnology.
Biotechnology has improved the specificity
of pharmaceuticals through greater
understanding of disease at the molecular
level. It has enabled companies to manufacture
products using genetic modification. British
Biotech is developing an anti-cancer drug,
Marimastat, which can be taken orally and is
claimed to have few serious adverse side-
effects. Among other major advances in the
development of drugs are human insulin and
interferons, genetically engineered vaccines,
antibiotics produced by fermentation, and
alternative bactericidal drugs based on Nisin, a
food preservative made in Britain.
A second generation of vaccines based on
recombinant DNA technology includes
SmithKline Beecham’s Engerix-B vaccine
against hepatitis. Therapies based on
correcting the function of defective genes are
under development. Diseases being targeted
include those where a single defective gene
needs correcting, such as in cystic fibrosis, and
those where there are genetic and
environmental components, like
cardiovascular disease.
Agricultural products include infection-
resistant crops; Zeneca is a world leader in
plant breeding, having brought onto the
market a genetically modified tomato paste.
Biotechnology is providing new tools for the
selection and design of microbes and enzymes
in food production. Diagnostic devices for the
medical, food, and product hygiene industries
are another strong sector.
Specialist goods from Britain’s small and
medium-sized biotechnology firms comprise,
among other items, medical diagnostics and
microbial pesticides. Medical diagnostics
products are used to diagnose diseases,
identify different blood types and can be
employed in the treatment of a range of
conditions, including cancer.
Important R & D activities include gene
therapy, combinatorial chemistry, regulation
of the cell cycle, and the development of
transgenic animals as sources of organs and as
bioreactors.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Synthetic Fibres
Synthetic fibres are supplied to the textiles,
clothing and footwear industries. The main
types of synthetic fibre are still those first
developed in the 1940s: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major synthetic
fibres like nylon polyamide, polyester and
acrylics. Extensive research continues to
produce a wide variety of innovative products;
antistatic and flame-retardant fibres are
examples. More specialist products include
the aramids (with very high thermal stability
and strength), elastanes (giving very high
stretch and recovery) and melded fabrics
(produced without the need for knitting or
weaving).
Courtaulds, one of Britain’s biggest
chemical companies, was responsible for
developing the first new artificial fibre for
decades, Tencel, a solvent-spun,
biodegradable fibre. It is twice as strong as
cotton while being soft enough to be used by
designers of luxury garments.
Mineral and Metal Products
In total these industries employ up to 700,000
people. From total crude steel output of 18
million tonnes, British producers delivered
17.5 million tonnes of finished steel in 1996, of
which 50 per cent was exported. Over the past
ten years annual steel industry exports have
increased by 44 per cent—to £3,700 million in
1996, creating a favourable balance of trade in
steel products of £2,300 million. Metals can
be recycled many times over: every year the
British metals recycling industry processes
around 2 million tonnes of scrap metal and 8
million tonnes of‘end of life’ items.
The major areas of steel production are in
south Wales and northern England, with
substantial processing in the Midlands and
Yorkshire. Major restructuring in the steel
industry took place during the 1980s and early
1990s. Productivity and efficiency have
improved and the industry is now one of the
most competitive in Europe.
British Steel is the fourth largest steel
producer in the world, employing 50,000 people
worldwide (41,000 in Britain) and producing 85
per cent of Britain’s crude steel in 1996. The
company’s output is based on semi-finished
steel, strip mill products, plate, heavy sections,
bars, wire rod and tubes. These are used
principally in the construction, automotive,
engineering, transport, metal goods, packaging
and energy industries. British Steel is Europe’s
biggest producer of engineering steels—
specialist grades used to make components for
the automotive and aerospace industries. It
owns 51 per cent of Avesta Sheffield, one of
Europe’s leading stainless steel producers.
Other important steel producers in Britain
include Caparo, Allied Steel and Wire, Co-
Steel Sheerness and the Glynwed Group.
Products manufactured by these companies
include reinforcing bars for the construction
industry, wire rod, hot rolled and cold
finished bars, and other special steels for the
aerospace and offshore oil and gas industries.
Several multinational companies, including
Alcan, Norsk Hydro, Kaiser, MIM and
Quexco, have plants in Britain producing non-
ferrous metals. The aluminium industry, which
has raised its productivity and competitiveness
significantly in recent years, supplies customers
in the aerospace, transport, automotive and
construction industries. Other important non-
ferrous metal sectors are copper, used for heat
exchangers, boilers, tubing and electrical gear;
lead for lead acid batteries and roofing; zinc for
galvanising to protect steel; nickel, used
principally as an alloying element to make
stainless steel and high temperature turbine
alloys; and titanium for high-strength, low-
weight aerospace applications.
Construction Materials and Products
A vast range of products is used in the
construction process, from structural steel,
glass and bricks to tiles and bathroom fittings.
Some 60 per cent of buildings of two or more
floors constructed today in Britain are based
on steel. Materials are estimated to make up
around 40 per cent of the value of construction
output, some £22,000 million a year. In 1996
exports amounted to approximately £4,000
million. The industry comprises some 20,000
firms employing 400,000 people.
Most crushed rock, sand and gravel
quarried by the aggregates industry is used in
construction. The brick industry, one of
220
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
Britain’s oldest, is regarded as the world’s
most technically advanced. Portland cement, a
19th-century British innovation, is the most
widely used chemical compound in the world.
Glass-reinforced cement composites for the
construction industry were invented in Britain
in the early 1970s and are made under licence
in over 40 countries. Blue Circle, Britain’s
largest producer of cement, and Rugby, the
third largest, are planning new plants, on a
wide scale, in south-east England and the
Midlands respectively.
Britain is a world leader in the manufacture
of glass used in windows, doors and cladding.
Flat glass is manufactured through the float
glass process, which was developed by
Pilkington Brothers and is licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkington
has also produced an energy-saving window
glass, which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility. The manufacture and
supply of windows and doors are carried out
by a large number of other companies
operating in one of three product sectors—
timber, metal (aluminium and steel) and
UPVC.
Ceramics
The ceramics industry manufactures domestic
pottery, as well as durables such as
sanitaryware, tiles and clay pipes for the
building trade. Domestic tableware
production includes fine china, earthenware
and stoneware. Tableware is produced
predominantly in Stoke-on-Trent. Britain is
the world’s leading manufacturer and exporter
of fine bone china: Waterford, Wedgwood,
Spode and Royal Doulton are among the more
famous names.
Research is being conducted into ceramics
for use in housebuilding and diesel and jet
engines (see p. 228). Important industrial
ceramics invented in Britain include some
forms of silicon carbide and sialons, which can
withstand ultra-high temperatures.
China Clay
Britain is the world’s second biggest exporter
of china clay (kaolin), three-quarters of which
is used in paper-making, and 2 million tonnes
of which were sold overseas in 1996. The main
company is ECC International, part of the
English China Clays Group.
Mechanical Engineering
The mechanical engineering sector has about
29,000 firms employing some 560,000 people.
In 1996 exports totalled nearly £21,000
million. Output includes pressure vessels,
heat exchangers and storage tanks for
chemical and oil-refining plant; steam-raising
boilers (including those for power stations);
nuclear reactors; water and sewage treatment
plant; and fabricated steelwork for bridges,
buildings and industrial installations.
Machine-building is an area in which
British firms excel, especially construction
and earth-moving equipment, wheeled
tractors, internal combustion engines, textile
machinery, medical equipment, fork-lift
trucks, pumps and compressors. Britain is one
of the world’s major producers of tractors
(almost a third of tractors produced in Europe
are manufactured in Britain), which make up
a large proportion of the country’s total
output of agricultural equipment. Among
leading tractor manufacturers are Massey
Ferguson, Case, New Holland and JCB.
Widely used technical innovations include
computer-controlled tractors, a highly
efficient pesticide sprayer and combined
mower/conditioners that reduce the drying
time for grass. Much new machinery is
designed for use in a variety of conditions to
meet the needs of overseas farmers.
Britain is a leading producer of machine
tools. Almost all are purchased by the
engineering, aerospace, automotive and metal
goods industries. The machine tools sector
has made a good recovery after a substantial
downturn in the early 1990s, with exports
doing especially well. Turnover of machine
tools was valued at over £870 million in 1996,
35 per cent more than in 1995; exports
account for almost two-thirds of turnover.
British manufacturers have made
technological advances in probes, sensors, co¬
ordinate measuring devices, laser melting and
the installation of flexible manufacturing
systems. Computer numerical-controlled
machines account for an increasing
221
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
proportion of output. Of the top six machine
tool companies in Britain, five are foreign-
owned; the 600 Group is the biggest British
company.
Most sales of textile machinery are to
export markets. British innovations include
computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed
computer-controlled knitting machines and
electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms. Britain also produces world-leading
printing machinery and ceramic processing
equipment, and other types of production
machinery.
Britain’s mining and tunnelling equipment
industry leads in the production of coal¬
cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports,
conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
JCB, Britain’s biggest construction
equipment manufacturer, is the world’s
leading maker of backhoe loaders and
telescopic handlers.
The mechanical lifting and handling
equipment industry makes cranes and
transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and air
bridges, as well as electronically controlled
and automatic handling systems. Britain is
also a major producer of industrial engines,
pumps, valves and compressors, and of
pneumatic and hydraulic equipment.
Companies such as Babcock manufacture
steam generators and other heavy equipment
for power plants. Despite an overall decline in
the castings industry, some foundries have
invested in new melting, moulding and
quality control equipment.
Electrical, Electronic and Instrument
Engineering
The electrical engineering industry
manufactures a broad range of goods: power
plant, cable, transformers and switchgear,
lighting, electrical installation products, and
heating, ventilating and air conditioning
equipment. The British-French group GEC
Alsthom is one of only a handful of firms in
the world which can supply the major
components for a complete power station
project and the transformers and switchgear
needed in transmission and distribution of
electricity. Rolls-Royce Industrial Power
Group uses highly efficient aero-derivative gas
turbines in smaller applications. Britain is a
world leader in the manufacture of generating
sets. In the cables sector, BICC and Pirelli
produce high-voltage transmission cables and
optical fibre cables for telecommunications.
TLG (formerly Thorn Lighting Group) is
Britain’s largest manufacturer of lighting
products.
The domestic electrical appliance sector
manufactures ‘white’ goods (washing
machines, refrigerators, dishwashers and so
on), vacuum cleaners, small domestic electrical
appliances and domestic gas appliances. It
employs about 28,000 people. Household
brand names include Hotpoint, Creda,
Candy/Hoover and Electrolux. Among
innovative products in the last few years is the
dual cyclone vacuum cleaner manufactured by
Dyson, which is now the leading upright
vacuum cleaner manufacturer in Britain. The
commercial heating, ventilation, air-
conditioning and refrigeration sector is served
to a great extent by small and medium-sized
firms, although several large multinational
companies have sites in Britain.
Eleven of the world’s leading electronics
firms have manufacturing plants in Britain,
and inward investment has become
extremely important. Chunghwa, Fujitsu,
Motorola, NEC, Seagate and Siemens are
among major overseas conglomerates to
make substantial outlays in Britain in the
last few years. In 1996 South Korea’s
Hyundai and LG groups announced
investments in Britain totalling more than
j£4,000 million; the latter will employ over
6,000 people at Europe’s largest inward
investment project in Newport, south
Wales, manufacturing semiconductors and
wide-screen television sets and
components. Several leading Japanese
consumer electronics firms, among them
Sony and Panasonic, are establishing major
manufacturing bases in Britain, with south
Wales attracting a large Share of the funds.
222
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
Britain has the fifth largest electronics
industry in the world, with an annual turnover
of about j£22,000 million. Products include
computers, telecommunications equipment
and a wide range of components, including
semiconductors. The major electronic
consumer goods produced are television sets
and high-fidelity audio and video equipment.
British manufacturers have a worldwide
reputation for high-quality goods aimed at the
upper end of the market.
Scotland’s electronics industry (‘Silicon
Glen’) directly employs about 40,000 people.
It produces 13 per cent of Europe’s
semiconductors, about 35 per cent of its
personal computers, about 45 per cent of its
computer workstations and some 50 per cent
of its automated cash dispensers. Japanese, US
and other overseas companies located in the
area include Compaq, Digital, Hughes, IBM,
Motorola, National Semiconductor and NEC.
Computers
This sector produces an extensive range of
systems, central processors and peripheral
equipment, from large computers for bulk
data-processing and scientific work to mini-
and microcomputers for control and
automation systems, and for home,
educational and office use. In 1996 exports of
computers and other information processing
equipment amounted to over ^11,000 million.
For information on software, see chapter 16,
pp. 247-8.
Britain’s biggest computer manufacturer is
the largely Japanese-owned ICE. Other
companies, such as Psion (a pioneer of the
‘palmtop’ computer), have concentrated on
developing new lines for specialised markets.
These include palmtop hand-held, pocket-
sized computers, increasingly used by
company sales forces, and notebook and pen
computers.
British firms and research organisations
have been involved in the development and
application of the family of ‘three-five’
semiconductor materials, such as gallium
arsenide; these are used in a number of devices
and in the production of faster-working
computers. Major advances are being made by
British firms and academic institutions in the
field of ‘virtual reality’, a three-dimensional
computer simulation technique with a host of
industrial and other applications. It is being
used to design buildings and a range of
products, including cars, pharmaceuticals and
machine tools.
Telecommunications
Britain has over 150 telecommunications
companies, including major multinationals, as
well as 2,500 call centres (central customer
service points), meeting the growing demand
for equipment and services (see pp. 321-3).
There has been rapid expansion in the market
for cordless and mobile telephones in the last
decade or so. Residential customers are
beginning to make greater use of what have
been primarily business communication
services, such as faxes, modems and
videotext.
The domestic telecommunications market
is worth some £3,200 million annually in
equipment. The equipment industry, which
has about 28,000 employees, is dominated by
large inward investors. It is at the forefront in
developing software-controlled digital public
switching. Britain’s main telecommunications
products are switching and transmission
equipment, telephones and terminals. GPT is
Britain’s foremost telecommunications
manufacturer; its range includes PBXs
(private branch exchanges), transmission
systems and videoconferencing equipment.
There has been major investment in Britain in
digital exchanges—BT has invested over
£20,000 million since the mid-1980s in
replacing electro-mechanical exchanges with
digital exchanges, which now account for
four-fifths of the network.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information networks
include submarine and high-specification data-
carrying cables. BT has led in the development
of optical fibre communications systems. It
paved the way for simpler and cheaper optical
cables by laying the first non-repeatered cable
over 100 km (62 miles) long, and by devising
the first all-optical repeater. Britain also has a
world lead in the transmission of computerised
data along telephone lines for reproduction on
television screens.
223
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Another sector of the industry manufactures
radio communications equipment, radar, radio
and sonar navigational aids for ships and
aircraft, thermal imaging systems, alarms and
signalling equipment, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital goods. Radar was
invented in Britain and British firms are still in
the forefront of technological advances. Racal
Avionics’ X-band radar for aircraft ground
movement control is in use at airports in several
overseas countries. Solid-state secondary
surveillance radar, manufactured by Cossor
Electronics, is being supplied to 50 overseas
civil aviation operators. Cable and Wireless’s
submarine cable-laying robot ‘CIRRUS’, which
can work at depths of up to 1 km (3,280 ft), is
controlled entirely by a computer on its mother
ship.
Medical Equipment
The high demand for advanced medical
equipment in Britain stems from its
comprehensive health care system and
numerous clinical research and testing
facilities undertaking research in the
chemical, biological, physical and molecular
sciences. Important contributions have been
made by Britain’s scientists and engineers to
basic R & D in endoscopy, CT (computerised
tomography) scanning, magnetic resonance
imaging (pioneered in Britain), ultrasonic
imaging, CADiagnosis and renal analysis.
Against this background, the industry—in
total more than 1,000 firms—continues its
tradition of developing and manufacturing a
large range of medical equipment for
domestic and overseas health sectors. It is
especially strong in the fields of electronic
measurement and test equipment, analytical
instruments, and process control equipment.
Companies such as GEC and Oxford
Instruments produce, among other things,
ultrasound scanners, electromyography
systems and patient monitoring systems for
intensive and coronary care and other uses.
Other well-known British-owned companies
include BTR, Smith and Nephew, Vickers
and Smiths Industries. Over half of medium
to large companies have a US or other
overseas parent and these account for over
two-fifths of total output.
Other Electronic Equipment
A variety of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in Britain, as well as
analytical instruments, process control
equipment, and numerical control and
indication materials for use in machine tools.
The instrument engineering industry makes
measuring, photographic, cinematographic
and reprographic items; watches, clocks and
other timing devices; and medical and surgical
instruments. Overseas sales of scientific and
photographic equipment were worth almost
£6,671 million in 1996.
Materials
New and improved materials, and the ability
to process and fabricate them more efficiently
into components, finished products and
systems, are vital to manufacturing industry.
Britain devotes a substantial proportion of its
R & D resources to developing these materials
and processes. Materials can be classified into
two main types: structural—which include
steels, non-ferrous alloys, engineering
ceramics, reinforced plastics, wood and
concrete; and functional—for exploiting the
electronic make-up and properties of such
things as conductors, semiconductors,
magnets and sensors. Materials are a key
element in medical engineering, and much
R & D work is being done in biomaterials,
biomechanics, implantable devices and
cellular/tissue engineering, for example.
Britain is at the leading edge of materials
science and technology. It is a prime
manufacturer in the areas of high temperature
materials, weight-saving technologies,
superconductivity, offshore supplies and
materials processing. It excels in the areas of
engineering ceramics and ceramic composites,
surface coatings, high temperature metals,
polymers, elastomers, polymer composites,
and metal matrix composites. Through the
development of new materials and
improvement of conventional ones, important
advances have been made in leading industrial
sectors such as aerospace, defence,
telecommunications, power generation,
offshore oil and gas structures, medical
equipment, construction and packaging. As
224
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
with traditional materials, the key properties
most often sought in a new one are fatigue
strength, stress/strain relationships, corrosion
resistance, and processability.
The aerospace industry has pioneered
various developments. Rolls-Royce is testing
ceramic and metal matrix composite materials
at high temperatures and aims to increase their
usage in aero-engines, improving the
performance of components while reducing
engine weight. Fibre-reinforced polymer
composites, increasingly used in aerospace
structures, possess high specific strength and
stiffness. Structural health monitoring of these
components may in the near future depend on
the use of ‘smart’ materials, in the form of
sensors (using optical fibres, for instance) to
be incorporated during manufacture into the
aircraft structure to produce a ‘sensitive skin’.
Smart materials could also be used in bridges;
they would indicate when and where repairs
were needed.
Biomaterials are being used in implant and
medical devices. HAPEX, a composite
ceramic with similar properties to the human
skeleton, has been developed at London
University. An artificial hip made from
HAPEX could last 25 years, compared with 15
years for existing artificial metal hips.
Automotive Industry
Around 750,000 jobs are dependent on the
automotive industry, including 310,000
engaged in vehicle and component production
and manufacturing activities. There are 22 car
and ten truck and van manufacturers, and
7,000 components manufacturers. Car output
is dominated by seven overseas groups,
accounting for 99 per cent of the total: Rover
(a subsidiary of BMW), Ford (including
Jaguar), Vauxhall, Peugeot-Talbot, Honda,
Nissan and Toyota. The remainder is in the
hands of smaller, specialist producers such as
Rolls-Royce, whose cars are renowned for
their quality and durability. Rover’s model
range includes the highly successful Land
Rover four-wheel drive vehicles and a full
range of family cars.
Capital investment continues on a large
scale, including nearly £2,600 million by Ford
between 1996 and 2000 and around £500
million a year by Rover as well as a £400
million investment in a new engine factory.
Since their arrival in the mid-1980s, Nissan,
Toyota and Honda have invested nearly
£4,000 million and by 1998 all three will be
producing two models in Britain. A period of
major change has accompanied the arrival of
the three Japanese car manufacturers. Their
management approach, high productivity,
quality, workforce commitment and co¬
operative partnerships have had a positive
effect on established car and component
manufacturers alike.
New car registrations increased by 4 per
cent in 1996 to 2.025 million, the third highest
total on record and the first time since 1990
that they have exceeded 2 million. Car
production, at 1.7 million, was at the highest
level since 1973, owing in large part to a
strong export performance. A total of 908,000
passenger cars were exported in 1996, more
than twice as many as in 1990. Exports of road
vehicles and their components in 1996 were
valued at £18,000 million, some 21 per cent
up on 1995.
Volvo is the biggest builder of buses in
Britain; in autumn 1996 it announced orders
for over 500 double-deck buses for operators
in Hong Kong and Singapore. In spring 1997,
Dennis Specialist Vehicles received orders for
421 double-deck buses from Hong Kong bus
operators. Britain’s first purpose-built bus to
be powered by liquefied petroleum gas is
being developed by Northern Counties.
The motor components industry has
enjoyed strong growth in recent times—both
in the British-owned sector and from
international investment^—and is ranked as
one of Britain’s major industries. It includes
British companies with worldwide operations,
such as LucasVarity, GKN and T&N, as well
as several of the world’s top-selling firms—
including Bosch and Valeo. Altogether, there
are now 28 German, 35 Japanese, 22 US and
15 French companies established in Britain.
Two-thirds of the components used in
British-built Japanese cars are manufactured
in Britain.
LucasVarity, which includes Varity
Perkins, is Britain’s largest automotive
systems supplier and one of the world’s top
ten automotive suppliers. It specialises in

million, of which 60 per cent are export
sales. About 700 firms are involved
exclusively in the industry. Six of the 11
Formula 1 car makers are based in Britain,
taking advantage of the country’s
engineering expertise in the design and
construction of racing chassis and engines.
Cosworth, a Vickers subsidiary, is the

braking, diesel, and electrical and electronic
components. GKN is a world leader in the
design and manufacture of automotive
driveline systems; it is the world’s foremost
producer of constant velocity joints linking
engines to wheels. T&N supplies customers
all over the world with bearings, friction
materials and piston and engine products.
Ford’s engine plant at Bridgend in south
Wales turns out over 500,000 Zetec engines a
year for export to Ford plants around Europe.
At its nearby Swansea factory, the company
produces 10 million components annually,
including camshafts, crankshafts and disc
brakes.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
In 1996 the merchant shipbuilding industry
had a turnover of £200 million and provided
employment for some 4,000 people in nine
yards. Order books of British merchant
shipbuilders for new building were estimated
to be worth £370 million at the end of March
1997. Merchant shiprepairers, with some
4,000 employees, had a turnover of £300
million in 1996. Including warship building,
repair and refit, the sector employs 26,000
people. The marine equipment industry is a
major contributor to the shipbuilding
industry, with equipment installed in a ship’s
hull accounting for about 50 per cent of its
total cost. In 1995 some 130 firms had a
turnover of £825 million. In total, there are
around 800 firms offering a complete range of
products, from sophisticated navigational
systems to diving equipment, about 70 per
cent of which is exported.
More than two decades of oil and gas
exploitation in the North Sea have generated a
major offshore industry (see p. 264).
Shipbuilders and fabricators build floating
production units and semi-submersible units
for drilling, production and emergency/
maintenance support; drill ships; jack-up rigs;
modules; and offshore loading systems. UIE
Scotland, Highlands Fabricators, John Brown
and McDermott Scotland are among the
larger manufacturers and designers. In 1996
Harland and Wolff of Belfast was awarded a
£70 million contract by BP to build the hull
for the world’s largest newly constructed
floating oil production vessel. Several
thousand firms supply other products needed
by the offshore industry—such as diving
equipment and helicopters—as well as
services, including consultancy, design,
project management and R & D. Their
experience of North Sea projects has enabled
them to establish themselves in oil and gas
markets throughout the world.
Railway Equipment
A number of companies based in Britain
manufacture locomotives, rolling stock,
signalling and other equipment for domestic and
overseas railway operators. The newly privatised
passenger train operators have announced plans
for major investments in new trains in the next
few years. In addition, Railtrack plans to invest
£10,000 million in track, signalling and other
rail infrastructure equipment (see p. 311).
Adtranz and GEC Alsthom have secured orders
in Britain worth respectively £360 million and
£190 million in 1996-97.
Aerospace and Defence
Britain’s aerospace industry, the biggest in
Europe, is one of only three in the world with
a complete capability across the whole
spectrum of aerospace. The leading companies
are British Aerospace (BAe), Rolls-Royce and
GEC-Marconi, all of which are among
Britain’s top five exporters. Just under 93,000
people are directly employed in the aerospace
226
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
industry, with a further 140,000 working in
related sectors. The Society of British
Aerospace Companies represents the interests
of 350 aerospace firms. Total sales of the
industry amounted to over £13,000 million in
1996, with exports contributing nearly
£10,000 million. Aircraft and parts account
for about two-fifths of overseas sales, with
engines and parts, missiles and aerospace
equipment (including satellite equipment)
making up the rest.
The industry’s activities cover designing
and constructing airframes, aero-engines,
guided weapons, simulators and space
satellites, materials, flight controls including
‘fly-by-wire’ and ‘fly-by-light’ equipment (see
p. 228), avionics and complex components,
with their associated services. In order to
improve fuel economy, engine and airframe
manufacturers use lighter materials such as
titanium and carbon-fibre composites (see p.
225), combined with advanced avionics and
improved aerodynamic techniques.
Britain is the second largest defence
supplier after the United States. The
aerospace industry has improved efficiency
and competitiveness to cope with reductions
in defence orders following the end of the
Cold War. British-based firms achieved a
record share of the world market for defence
supplies in 1996, with exports estimated at
£4,700 million. An increase in the amount of
collaborative development of civil and military
aircraft and engines, as well as aviation
equipment and satellites, is leading to
significant savings on the costs of long-term
programmes. The four-nation Eurofighter
programme (see p. 148), involving British
, Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and 200 other British
defence firms, is expected to support up to
14,000 jobs in Britain at the peak of
production early next century.
Civil Aircraft
British Aerospace (BAe) produces both civil
and military aircraft, as well as guided weapons
and aircraft components. It has a 20 per cent
share of the European consortium Airbus
Industrie, with responsibility for designing and
manufacturing the wings for the whole family
of Airbus airliners, from the short- to medium-
haul A320 series (the first civil airliner to use
fly-by-wire controls—see p. 228) to the large
long-range four-engined A340. In 1996 Airbus
signed firm orders for 326 new aircraft worth a
total of US$23,600 million from 31 customers
around the world, giving it a 40 per cent market
share for airliners with more than 100 seats.
With Aerospatiale of France and Italy’s Alenia,
BAe has formed a regional aircraft alliance
which jointly markets turboprops and jet
aircraft with between 29 and 115 seats; these
include BAe’s Avro RJ family of regional ‘quiet
jet’ airliners.
The Canadian-owned Short Brothers of
Belfast, with 9,000 employees, is engaged in the
design and production of major civil aircraft
sub-assemblies, advanced engine nacelles and
components for aerospace manufacturers as
well as the provision of aviation support
services. It is a leading supplier to Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas among others. Shorts is a
partner in manufacturing the 50-seat Canadair
Regional Jet airliner (it will also contribute
airframe parts for the new 70-seat version); the
Learjet 45, a small business jet aircraft; and the
Bombardier Global Express long-range
business jet.
Slingsby Aviation produces several versions
of the T67 Firefly two-seater training and
acrobatic aircraft for customers around the
world. The United States Air Force has
chosen the T67 as its new basic trainer and
113 aircraft are being built. Slingsby also
designs and makes composite components for
the aviation and other industries. Pilatus
Britten-Norman manufactures the Islander
light utility aircraft, which has had sales in
over 100 countries.
Military Aircraft and Missiles
British Aerospace is one of the world’s top
defence companies, with more than four-fifths
of its military production exported in 1996.
Among its military aircraft is the Harrier, a
vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL)
military combat aircraft. BAe produces the
Hawk fast-jet trainer; the company has signed
a £1,000 million contract for the sale of 40
Hawks to Australia. It has also created, with
McDonnell Douglas, the Goshawk T45
carrier jet trainer.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The Tornado combat aircraft is built by a
company set up jointly by BAe, Alenia and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace. A £5,000 million
order for 48 Tornado bombers for Saudi
Arabia, confirmed in 1993, made it one of
Britain’s biggest ever export deals. Together
with Alenia, Daimler-Benz and Aerospatiale,
BAe has formed a new company, a military
subsidiary of Airbus Industrie, to manage the
Future Large Aircraft military transport
programme.
BAe is a major supplier of tactical guided
weapon systems for use on land, at sea and in
the air, having merged its missile business
with that of France’s Matra Corporation to
form Europe’s largest guided weapons
concern. Shorts Missile Systems Ltd (SMS) is
a joint venture between Shorts and Thomson-
CSF of France in the area of very short-range
air defence systems.
GEC-Marconi has an annual turnover of
£3,500 million, and employs a total of 29,000
people in Britain and overseas. The company
is prime contractor for the PHOENIX
unmanned aerial vehicle project. Due to enter
service with the British Army in 1998,
PHOENIX will provide reconnaissance and
target acquisition support to artillery systems.
Helicopters
GKN-Westland Helicopters manufactures the
Sea King, Lynx and Apache military
helicopters, and, in partnership with Agusta of
Italy, the multi-role EH101 medium-lift
helicopter at its Somerset facilities. Over 1,000
Westland helicopters are in service in 19
countries. Orders currently being fulfilled
include ones for the Royal Navy (for the
EH 101), Royal Air Force (EH101 and Sea
King) and the British Army (Apache), and
customers from Brazil (Lynx), Norway (Sea
King) and Italy (EH 101). Major Sea King
upgrading programmes are being undertaken
for Australia, Belgium and Norway.
Aero-engines
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three prime
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a
turnover in 1996 of nearly £3,000 million for
its aerospace division. The Group’s
commercial aero-engine company makes
engines for airliners and regional, executive
and corporate jets. Over 50,000 Rolls-Royce
engines are in service with more than 300
airlines in over 100 countries. More than 80
per cent of Boeing 757 operators have selected
RB211-535 engines. The company’s latest
large engine, the Trent, powers the new
generation of wide-body twin-engined
airliners, such as Boeing’s 777 and the Airbus
A330. Rolls-Royce is a partner in the five-
nation International Aero Engine consortium,
which manufactures the low-emission V2500
aero-engine, now in service on the Airbus
A320 and A321 as well as the McDonnell
Douglas MD90. It is also in partnership with
BMW, producing engines for large corporate
jets and regional aircraft.
Rolls-Royce produces military engines for
both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and is
a partner in the EJ200 engine project for the
Eurofighter. It also owns the Allison Engine
Company of the United States—a world leader
in helicopter and large turboprop engines.
Aviation Equipment
Around one-third of the aerospace industry is
devoted to designing and manufacturing
aviation equipment. British firms have made
significant technological advances.
Manufacturers like Dowty, GEC-Marconi,
Lucas, Smiths Industries, Racal, Normalair-
Garrett and BAe provide equipment and
systems for engines and aircraft propellers,
navigation and landing systems, engine and
flight controls, environmental controls and
oxygen breathing and regulation systems,
electrical generation, mechanical and hydraulic
power systems, cabin furnishings, flight-deck
controls and information displays. GEC-
Marconi is the world’s largest manufacturer of
head-up displays (HUDs).
British firms have made important advances
in developing ejection seats, firefighting
equipment and flight simulators, as well as fly¬
by-wire and fly-by-light technology, where
control surfaces on the wings and elsewhere are
moved by means of automatic electronic
signalling and fibre optics respectively, rather
than by mechanical means. GEC-Marconi
supplies the fly-by-wire system for the Boeing
228
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
111. Britain’s aerospace companies provide
radar and air traffic control equipment and
ground power supplies to airports and airlines
worldwide.
Space Equipment and Services
Over 400 companies employing almost 6,500
people are engaged in industrial space activities
(see pp. 334—5). With growth of more than 10
per cent a year in the last decade, annual
turnover of this sector is now around £800
million. The British National Space Centre
(BNSC) is a partnership comprising
government departments concerned with civil
space. Through its participation in the
European Space Agency, the BNSC has
enabled British-based companies to participate
in many leading space projects covering
telecommunications, satellite navigation, Earth
observation, space science and astronomy.
Britain is Europe’s biggest user of space.
The industry is strong in the development
and manufacture of civil and military
communications satellites and associated Earth
stations and ground infrastructure equipment.
In the field of Earth observation, it plays a major
role in manufacturing platforms, space radar
and meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
The largest British space company is Matra
Marconi Space UK, which, together with its
French partner, is one of the world’s major
space companies. It has become the leading
provider of direct broadcast television satellites,
acting as prime contractor for Eutelsat’s Hot
Bird satellites, SES’ Astra 2B, ST-1 for
Singapore and Taiwan, and Intelsat’s K-TV
satellite. Other activities include design and
manufacture of the SKYNET 4 and NATO IV
military communications satellites. It is also
developing a new telecommunications
I spacecraft ‘bus’—Eurostar 3000—which will
be able to deliver direct-to-home broadcasting
services. It is involved in nearly all of Europe’s
^ space science projects, including the SOHO
scientific satellite launched in 1995 to study the
Sun, as well as in Earth observation missions,
having responsibility for the ENVISAT
spacecraft and space radar systems.
Other firms, such as EEV, Sira, Pilkington,
Com Dev, ERA and AEA Technology, supply
satellite subsystems, and IGG is Europe’s
leading procurer and tester of space qualified
components. British companies such as Surrey
Satellite Technology and Space Innovations
are leaders in the field of micro and mini
satellites, which provide relatively quick and
cheap access to space. Major suppliers of
satellite ground stations include Anite, EOS,
Logica, Science Systems and Vega.
Companies operating in the field of remote
sensing applications—the development of
information products from satellite data—
include the National Remote Sensing Centre,
Remote Sensing Applications Consultants and
Nigel Press Associates.
Construction
Annual output of the construction industry is
around £55,000 million. Most construction
work is done by private firms, the majority of
which employ fewer than 25 people. While only
87 out of a total of nearly 165,000 firms employ
more than 600 people directly, these companies
undertake 15 per cent of all construction in
Britain. Some larger firms own quarries and
factories for materials manufacture, and
sophisticated plant. Several undertake
responsibility for all stages of projects from
design to final construction.
Efficiency and productivity in construction
have benefited from greater off-site fabrication
of standardised components and from
techniques such as computer-aided design,
computerised stock ordering and job costing,
electronic load safety measures for cranes, and
distance measuring equipment.
Building Regulations
Building regulations issued by the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions prescribe minimum standards
of construction in England and Wales.
Administered and enforced by local
government, the regulations apply to new
building, the installation or replacement of
fittings, alterations and extensions to existing
buildings, and certain changes of use of
existing buildings. Similar controls apply in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. An alternative
to local authority building control involves
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
private certification of compliance with
building regulations. The British Standards
Institution is providing much of Britain’s
contribution to the drafting of European
standards, which are increasingly replacing
national construction standards.
Research and Advisory Services
The Building Research Establishment, sold by
the Government to the Foundation for the
Built Environment in March 1997, provides
advice and research services to government
and industry on the design, construction and
performance of buildings, together with the
health and safety of people in and around
buildings. Its areas of expertise include
prevention and control of fires and protection
of the environment. It supports the
development of European codes and
standards, and has links with a variety of
international organisations. Other research
associations, as well as major construction and
materials firms, universities and colleges and
the British Board of Agrement, also carry out
research and provide advisory services for
government and industry. The Building
Centre supplies exhibition and information
services on materials, products, techniques
and building services.
Project Procurement, Management and
Financing
The most common basis of procurement for
construction projects is a lump-sum contract
with provision for variation. The largest
projects are often carried out under the
direction of construction managers or
management contractors. Clients generally
employ architects, project managers or civil
engineers to advise on the feasibility of projects,
draw up plans, and inspect and supervise the
construction work.
Private and public sector projects are
managed in a variety of ways. Most clients
invite construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist sub-contractors.
Alternative methods of contracting are
becoming more common: for example, contracts
might include subsequent provision of building
maintenance or a comprehensive ‘design-and-
build’ service, where a single company accepts
responsibility for every stage of a project.
Under the Government’s Private Finance
Initiative/Public-Private Partnerships (see
p. 160), following competitive bidding,
private sector companies construct large-
scale public infrastructure projects. The
initiative is providing a substantial boost to
the construction industry. Among current
projects are the Heathrow Express line and
the £200 million Lewisham extension to
London’s Docklands Light Railway (see
pp. 312-3). The Channel Tunnel Rail
Link (CTRL) and the Thameslink 2000
railway will also be built by the private
sector. The CTRL will be a 110-km (68-
mile) high-speed railway costing about
£3,000 million; the Thameslink 2000
scheme will extend services between north
and south London through the City. The
Government has also signed contracts for
several DBFO (Design, Build, Finance
and Operate) road schemes (£700 million)
and three prisons (£200 million).
Housing
During 1996 construction of some 172,800
dwellings was started in Great Britain. Starts
by private sector concerns were 143,500, by
housing associations 28,800 and in the public
sector 600. Around 179,000 dwellings were
completed: 146,700 by the private sector,
31,500 by housing associations and 800 by the
public sector. The total value of new housing
orders was £6,500 million.
Major Construction Projects in Britain
The most important recent construction
project is the Channel Tunnel, the largest
single civil engineering project ever
undertaken in Europe (see p. 312). Completed
in 1993, its estimated cost was £10,000
million. Building work was carried out by a
consortium of ten French and British
contractors working together as Transmanche
Link (TML). The tunnel is nearly 50 km (31
miles) long and is 70 m (230 ft) below sea level
230
at its deepest. Associated projects included
new international stations at Waterloo in
London and Ashford (Kent), and an
international terminal at Folkestone.
Other major building projects in hand or
recently completed are the London
Underground Jubilee Line extension, the M74
in Scotland, the extensive development in
London’s Docklands, and the Sizewell B
nuclear power station in Suffolk. Both
Stansted and Manchester airports have been
substantially redeveloped. There has also been
large-scale redevelopment of sports stadiums,
including: Twickenham (near London) and
Murrayfield (Edinburgh) rugby grounds;
Wembley football stadium; a new rugby
stadium in Cardiff; and new football stadiums
for Middlesbrough and Sunderland football
clubs. Major redevelopment work is taking
place at the Wimbledon lawn tennis complex.
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
British companies are engaged in major
undertakings throughout the world and have
been in the forefront of management contracting
and of‘design and construct’ operations. They
are increasingly engaged in developing privately
financed projects. Contractors and consultants
undertake the supervision and all or part of the
construction of a project. Consultants are
engaged in the planning, design and supervision
of construction enterprises. British companies
have a reputation for integrity and independence.
British contractors are active in over 100
countries. In 1996 they won new international
business valued at £4,800 million. North
America remains the most valuable market,
accounting for two-fifths of all new contracts.
Important international contracts won in
1996—97 include:
• a suspension bridge across the Yangtse
River in China, which will be the fourth
longest bridge in the world;
• the Harare international airport terminal;
MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
• the new arrivals building at New York’s
JFK international airport;
• Ashgabat Airport in Turkmenistan;
• a hospital in Hong Kong;
• elevated road/rail systems in Bangkok;
• stations and other buildings for the Kuala
Lumpur light rail transit;
• a new metro project in Copenhagen; and
• a television complex in Cairo.
British engineering consultants are engaged
in projects in 140 countries. In 1996 members
of the Association of Consulting Engineers
were engaged in new programmes overseas
with a total value of £46,000 million. The
capital value of projects under way at the end
of 1996 was £108,000 million, 32 per cent up
on the previous year. British consulting
engineers had estimated gross earnings in 1996
of nearly £900 million from overseas
commissions, an increase of 20 per cent over
1995. The three largest categories of work
covered roads, bridges and tunnels; land
planning and development; and structural-
commercial projects. The most important
markets were the Far East (accounting for
One-half of current and new work), Africa,
India and the Middle East; Eastern Europe is
an increasingly important market, providing
new work valued at £6,000 million in 1996,
compared with £1,500 million in 1995. Major
new international projects include:
• airports in Hong Kong and South Korea;
• railways in Singapore and Hong Kong;
• a chemical plant in Nigeria;
• hydro-electric plants in Mozambique and
Pakistan;
• a thermal power station in Pakistan;
• water works in Nigeria;
• land planning and development in China;
• a water treatment project in Shanghai; and
• the Cairo waste water project.

Britain remains a world leader in the provision of financial and business
services, which make a substantial contribution to its balance of payments. As
well as finance, the service industries include business services, retailing and
tourism. They contribute about 63 per cent of gross domestic product and 75
per cent of employment. The number of employees in services rose from over
13 million in 1983 to nearly 17.3 million by June 1997. Several of the largest
building societies have recently become banks.
The Government has announced plans to strengthen and simplify the system
of financial regulation. Reforms are also under way at the Bank of England, the
most radical in its 300-year history.
As a result of rising real incomes, consumer
spending on financial, personal and leisure
services has increased considerably. Travel,
hotel and restaurant services in Britain are
among those to have benefited from the rapid
growth in tourism over recent years. Indeed,
by the year 2000, tourism is expected to be
the world’s biggest industry, and Britain is
one of the world’s leading tourist
destinations. The industry is one of Britain’s
largest, employing about 7 per cent of the
workforce. Another important growth area is
business services, which covers areas such as
exhibition and conference facilities,
computing services, market research,
management consultancy, and advertising and
public relations.
Financial Services
Historically the heart of the financial services
industry in Britain has been located in the
‘Square Mile’ in the City of London, and this
remains broadly the case. Other financial
centres are Edinburgh (the sixth largest in
Europe, in terms of institutional equity funds
managed), Manchester, Cardiff, Liverpool,
Leeds and Glasgow.
The City is one of the world’s three leading
financial centres, along with Tokyo and New
York, and by far the biggest in Europe. An
important feature is the size of its international
activities. It is noted for having:
• more overseas banks than any other
financial centre;
232
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
• one of the world’s largest international
insurance markets;
• the biggest market in the world for
trading foreign equities, accounting for
60 per cent of global turnover;
• by far the world’s biggest foreign
exchange market, actively trading the
largest range of currencies and handling
30 per cent of worldwide dealing;
• the world’s second largest fund
management centre, with £1,681,000
million of institutional equity holdings in
1996;
• Europe’s leading financial futures and
options market;
• the world’s largest centre for issuance of
international bonds, with 60 per cent of
this market and 75 per cent of secondary
trading;
• important markets for transactions in
commodities; and
• a full range of ancillary and support
services—legal, accountancy and
management consultancy—which
contribute to London’s strength as a
financial centre.
British financial institutions’ net overseas
earnings were a record £22,700 million in
1996, 9 per cent higher than in 1995.
DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL
SERVICES
The markets for financial and related services
have grown and diversified greatly during the
last 25 years. Major events during this period
include the abolition of exchange controls in
1979, the ‘Big Bang’ in 1986 (see p. 245) and
legislation allowing building societies and
friendly societies to diversify their activities.
Traditional distinctions between financial
institutions have been eroded, so that single
firms now supply a broader range of services,
in both domestic and international markets. In
the British market recent developments have
included:
• intense competition between financial
institutions in providing services to
personal customers;
• rapid growth in the use of debit and
credit cards (see p. 239);
• greater use of telephone-based services,
for example in insurance, home banking
and mortgages; and
• new financial products, such as tax-free
TESSAs (Tax Exempt Special Savings
Accounts, which allow tax-free saving
with a bank or building society of up to
£9,000 over five years), PEPs (Personal
Equity Plans, see p. 244) and PEP-
backed mortgages.
A significant feature of 1997 has been the
conversion of several of the biggest building
societies into banks (see p. 237). They have
changed from mutual societies, owned by
their members, into private sector
companies owned by their shareholders and
quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
Many members of the societies concerned
have received shares in the new companies,
and this has led to a substantial increase in
the number of shareholders. Building
society flotations, together with the
flotation of the Norwich Union insurance
company (which has also abandoned its
mutual status), are estimated to have
created ‘windfall gains’ of over £35,000
million for their former members.
SUPERVISION
Current System
HM Treasury is the government department
with principal responsibility for oversight of
the financial services sector. In particular, it is
responsible for legislation covering the
regulation of banks, building societies,
friendly societies, credit unions and
investment business. It also oversees the Bank
of England and the new Financial Services
Authority (FSA), which succeeded the
Securities and Investments Board in October
1997 under the changes to the regulatory
framework (see below).
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) is responsible for company law and
insolvency matters. Its duties include
prudential supervision of insurance
233
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
undertakings, handling of European
Community (EC) directives, and
consideration of general issues affecting the
insurance industry. It also has powers to
investigate ‘insider dealing’—securities
trading carried out on the basis of privileged
access to relevant information.
Regulation of Investment Business
Under the Financial Services Act 1986, those
dealing in, arranging deals in, managing or
advising on investments, operating collective
investment schemes or providing safe custody
services require authorisation and are subject
to rules on the conduct of business. The FSA
is responsible for recognising a number of
‘front-line’ regulators: self-regulating
organisations (SROs) and recognised
professional bodies (RPBs). Most investment
businesses are authorised by virtue of
membership of one of these. The SROs are:
• the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (IMRO), which regulates
about 1,100 fund management firms;
• the Securities and Futures Authority
(SFA), which has about 1,300 members,
including member firms of the London
Stock Exchange, as well as futures
brokers and dealers, and eurobond
dealers; and
• the Personal Investment Authority (PIA),
which regulates some 4,000 firms,
including independent financial advisers,'
which advise on or market retail
investment products (such as life
insurance, personal pensions and unit
trusts) or act for private investors in
relation to such products.
The FSA also supervises the six recognised
investment exchanges in Britain (such as the
London Stock Exchange), and is responsible
for recognising and supervising the clearing
houses, which organise the settlement of
transactions on these exchanges.
The Investors Compensation Scheme can
make payments of up to £48,000 to private
investors if a firm regulated by an SRO or by
the FSA is unable to meet its investment
business liabilities. Since 1988, the scheme has
helped customers of about 300 firms, and paid
out £117 million to over 10,000 investors.
Banking Supervision
The Bank of England has statutory
responsibility for the supervision of banks in
Britain within the framework of the Banking
Act 1987 and legislation implementing EC
directives. The Bank carries out its
responsibilities with the aim of strengthening,
but not guaranteeing, the protection of bank
depositors and thereby increasing confidence
in the banking system as a whole. Banks are
required to meet minimum standards on the
integrity and competence of directors and
management, the adequacy of capital and of
cash flow, and the appropriateness of systems
and controls to deal with the risks experienced
by banks.
If a bank fails to meet the criteria, its
activities may be restricted, or it may be
closed. If a bank fails, there is a limited
amount of protection available to small
depositors, financed by levies on the banking
system.
The Bank of England also has formal
responsibility for supervising firms in the
wholesale markets for sterling, foreign
exchange and bullion, and monitors links
between the various financial markets.
Proposed New Regulatory Framework
The Government believes that the current
arrangements for financial services regulation
need modernising and strengthening in
keeping with the rapid change in the structure
of financial markets, to deliver more effective
and efficient supervision. It has decided to
bring the regulation of banking, securities and
insurance together under a single regulator,
enabling the regulatory system to cope better
with Britain’s increasingly integrated financial
markets. It has therefore announced a number
of major changes:
• responsibility for banking supervision
will be transferred to the FSA, probably
in spring 1998;
• the FSA will oversee all the financial
markets and acquire the functions of the
234
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
SFA, IMRO, the PIA and the DTI’s
insurance responsibilities; and
• the current system of self-regulation in
investment services will be replaced by a
fully statutory system designed to put the
public interest first and restore
confidence in the regulatory system.
A draft Regulatory Reform Bill will be
published in 1998, with a view to having the
new regulatory system fully operational by
about the end of 1999.
International Agreements
HM Treasury represents Britain in negotiating
and ensuring the implementation of relevant
EC directives on the financial services sector,
co-ordinating as necessary with the Bank of
England, the FSA and other bodies. The main
purpose of such directives is to provide a
framework to allow banking, investment and
insurance firms to operate throughout the
European Economic Area (EEA) on the basis of
their home state authorisation.
Britain plays a major role in encouraging
international regulatory co-operation in the G7
and other intergovernmental fora and, at the
technical level, in the Bank for International
Settlements, the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision, the International Organisation of
Securities Commissions and the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors.
Appropriate cross-border information-sharing
arrangements are significant in the success of
such co-operation, and the regulatory bodies
play a key role in these arrangements. Britain is
also at the forefront of action to encourage
international liberalisation in financial services,
having played a leading role in negotiating the
General Agreement on Trade in Services, part
of the World Trade Organisation series of
agreements (see p. 206). It is also involved in
negotiations within the OECD, which aim to
reach by April 1998 a new Multilateral
Agreement on Investment that will provide for
high standards of liberalisation and investment
protection.
BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England was established in 1694
by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a
corporate body. Its capital stock was acquired
by the Government in 1946. As Britain’s
central bank, its overriding objective is to
maintain a stable and efficient monetary and
financial framework for the effective operation
of the economy. In pursuing this goal, it has
three main purposes:
• maintaining the integrity and value of the
currency;
• maintaining the stability of the financial
system; and
• seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the
financial services sector.
Changes affecting the role of the Bank and
its accountability were announced by the
Government in May 1997.
New Monetary Policy Framework
Under the new framework for monetary policy
(see p. 156), the Bank of England has acquired
operational responsibility for setting interest
rates. The Bank’s monetary policy objective is
to deliver price stability, as defined by the
target set by the Government, by setting
short-term interest rates. Decisions on interest
rate changes are made by the Bank’s newly
established Monetary Policy Committee and
implemented through the Bank’s operations in
the financial markets. These arrangements are
operating on an interim basis until the required
legislation to set up the new framework and
provide for greater accountability is enacted,
probably in the first half of 1998.
Other Changes
The Bank is currently responsible for banking
supervision (see p. 234), but its role would be
transferred to the FSA after enactment of the
Bank of England Bill. Its role as the
Government’s agent for debt management,
and its oversight of the gilts market (see p.
167) would be transferred to the Treasury.
The Bill will also provide for reforms to the
Court of the Bank of England, which will be
responsible for reviewing the performance of
the Bank, including the Monetary Policy
Committee. The Government plans that the
non-executive members of the Court will be
235
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
representative of the whole of Britain; they
will be widely drawn from industry,
commerce and finance.
In addition, some changes are being made to
the Bank’s role in the foreign exchange markets.
The Government remains responsible for
determining exchange rate policy, while the
Bank will continue to act as the Treasury’s agent
in managing the Government’s reserves of gold
and foreign exchange and its foreign currency
borrowing. Under the Bank of England Bill, the
Bank will have its own pool of foreign exchange
reserves which it may use to intervene in support
of its monetary policy objective. It will continue
to undertake foreign exchange transactions on
behalf of its customers.
Other Functions
The Bank provides banking services to its
customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It plays
a key role in payment and settlement systems,
and has sole right in England and Wales to issue
banknotes, which are backed by government
and other securities. The profit from the note
issue is paid directly to the Government. Three
Scottish and four Northern Ireland banks may
also issue notes, but these have to be fully
backed by Bank of England notes.
The Bank of England plays an active role in
ensuring that the City maintains its position as
a leading international financial centre, and that
it provides appropriate financial services. It
carries out this role by monitoring the structure
and operation of City markets and the
performance of City firms. The Bank promotes
collective initiatives where the interests of the
financial institutions differ. It is playing a full
part in the technical preparations for economic
and monetary union within the EU (see p. 124).
BANKING SERVICES
The main financial institutions offering
banking services are banks and building
societies. However, the distinction between
them is becoming less, as both types of
institution diversify their services.
A distinction can still be made between
‘retail’ and ‘wholesale’ banking:
• Retail banking is primarily for personal
customers and small businesses. Its main
services are deposit and withdrawal
facilities, personal and business lending,
and money transmission.
• Wholesale business involves taking larger
deposits, deploying funds in money-
market instruments (see p. 245), and
making corporate loans and investments.
Nearly all banks in Britain engage in
some wholesale activities and some, such
as the merchant banks and overseas banks
operating in Britain, centre their business
on them. Many dealings are conducted
on the inter-bank market, between banks
themselves.
Other businesses, particularly insurance
companies and supermarkets, are entering
the banking field. Among insurance
companies now offering banking services
are Prudential, Standard Life, and Legal &
General. Three of the large supermarket
chains—Tesco, J. Sainsbury and
Safeway—also offer banking services, run
in conjunction with major banks. For
example, Sainsbury’s Bank, a joint venture
with the Bank of Scotland launched in
spring 1997, has some 500,000 customers
and deposits of £1,000 million.
In 1997 there were 361 institutions
authorised under the Banking Act 1987,
including clearing banks, investment banks,
branches of overseas banks from outside the
EE A, and banking subsidiaries of banking and
non-banking institutions from Britain and
overseas. A further 105 branches of banks
from other EEA countries were entitled to
accept deposits in Britain. Of the total of 516
institutions permitted to take deposits in
Britain, over 300 were members of the British
Bankers’ Association, the principal
representative body for banks operating in
Britain.
Retail Banks and Banking Groups
Retail banks now offer many more services
than just the traditional banking services of
236
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
current accounts, deposit accounts and loan
arrangements. Credit and debit cards are
widely available through banks, as are
mortgages, insurance, investment products—
including TESSAs, PEPs, pensions and unit
trusts—and share-dealing services. Most
major British banks are complex financial
groups, which own finance houses, leasing and
factoring companies, merchant banks,
securities dealers, insurance companies and
unit trust companies, and most also have
overseas subsidiaries or branches.
Six banks are in Britain’s top 20 companies,
in terms of market capitalisation: Lloyds TSB,
HSBC (including its subsidiary Midland),
Barclays, Halifax, National Westminster and
Abbey National (the first building society to
convert to a bank, in 1989).
The banking sector has been transformed
during 1997 with five top-ten building
societies becoming, or being taken over by,
banks: Halifax, Woolwich, Alliance &
Leicester, Bristol & West (which was acquired
by the Bank of Ireland) and Northern Rock.
Halifax pic, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender,
is by far the largest of the new banks. On its
flotation in June 1997 it had nearly 8 million
shareholders. Among the reasons given for
converting were to facilitate expansion and
offer a wider range of financial services. Banks
now account for some 70 per cent of mortgage
loans (see p. 382), double the level prevailing
before the changes.
Other major banks are the Bank of Scotland
and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Among the
smaller retail banks are the Co-operative Bank
and two banks owned by National Australia
Bank: the Clydesdale Bank and the Yorkshire
Bank. Northern Ireland is served by branch
networks of four major banking groups:
Northern Bank, Ulster Bank, First Trust
Bank and Bank of Ireland.
Competition among the banks and other
financial institutions is intense, especially in
the markets for personal savings, consumer
credit and mortgages. The banks have taken
steps to increase efficiency and control costs
by, for example, providing new services and
extending opening hours. However, the
network of bank branches has fallen, in part
because of the move to telephone and
computer banking (see p. 240), and staff levels
have declined, especially through centralising
‘back-office’ operations and reducing head
office and support functions. Profitability has
risen, reflecting, among other things, the
strengthening of the economy, cost savings
and lower bad debts; in 1996 profits of the
eight large British banks totalled £10,640
million. Total liabilities/assets of banks in
Britain amounted to over £2,181,800 million
at the end of June 1997.
Merchant Banks
The traditional role of merchant banks was to
accept, or guarantee, commercial bills, and to
sponsor (underwrite) capital issues on behalf
of their customers. Today they undertake a
much wider range of investment banking
activities. They have important roles in equity
and debt markets and in the provision of
advice and financial services to industrial
companies, especially where mergers,
takeovers and other forms of corporate
reorganisation are involved. Management of
investment holdings, including trusts,
pensions and other funds, is another
important function. As with retail banks, there
has been a process of consolidation, and
several British-owned merchant banks have
been acquired by overseas banks.
Overseas Banks
London is a major centre for international
banking; in 1996 more international banking
business took place in Britain than in any
other market in the world. Banks from many
countries have subsidiaries, branches or
representative offices in London. France has
the greatest number—50—followed by Japan,
the United States and Italy. Like the major
British banks, these overseas banks offer a
comprehensive banking service in many parts
of the world, and engage in financing trade not
only between Britain and other countries but
also between third-party countries.
British-based Overseas Banks
A small number of banks have their head
offices in Britain, but operate mainly abroad,
237
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
often specialising in particular regions.
Standard Chartered, which is represented in
Asia, Africa and the Middle East, is the major
example of this type of bank. It has a network
of around 500 offices in nearly 50 countries.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers, which
specialise in housing finance and retail deposit¬
taking services. They are the second main
source of housing finance in Britain. They
make long-term mortgage loans against the
security of property—usually private dwellings
purchased for owner-occupation. Competition
between lenders for business intensified in the
first half of the 1990s when house prices fell
and fewer people moved house, and remains
intense despite an improving housing market
since 1995. Remortgaging, whereby a borrower
changes lender or switches to a different
mortgage from the same lender, has become
much more prevalent. Societies are extending
their banking services, for example by
providing current account facilities, such as
cheque books and automated teller machines
(ATMs).
Structure
During 1997 the sector was transformed as a
result of the decision by five of the biggest
societies to abandon their mutual status and
become banks (see p. 237). Members of all
these societies voted for conversion by large
majorities; qualifying members were usually
eligible for cash or shares in the new bank. As a
result, the level of assets in the building society
sector has fallen by over half since the end of
1996, when it was around ^300,000 million.
There has also been a process of mergers
between building societies, the latest being
between the Portman and the Greenwich in
July 1997. There are now 71 authorised
building societies, of which 70 are members of
the Building Societies Association.
The largest building society is now the
Nationwide, with group assets of £37,600
million. Other large societies are Bradford &
Bingley, Britannia and Yorkshire.
Diversification
The Building Societies Act 1986 enabled
societies to diversify into a wider range of
financial and housing-related services, and
established the Building Societies Commission
to carry out the prudential supervision of
building societies. Since then, further steps
have been taken to relax restrictions on their
commercial activities. The Building Societies
Act 1997 established a new, more ‘permissive’
regime whereby, with a few exceptions,
societies could undertake a wider variety of
activities, enabling them to respond quickly to
developments in the financial services and
housing markets. The chief requirements for j
societies are that:
• at least 75 per cent of lending has to be
on the security of housing; and
• a minimum of 50 per cent of funds has to
be in the form of shares held by
individual members.
The Act also contained provisions to increase
the accountability of societies to members, and
strengthened the supervisory powers of the
Building Societies Commission.
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial and insurance services, particularly
provision for retirement and against loss of
income through sickness or unemployment.
The Friendly Societies Act 1992 enabled
friendly societies to incorporate, take on new
powers and provide a broader range of
financial services through subsidiaries. It also
established the Friendly Societies Commission
to administer a system of regulation and to
promote the financial stability of societies.
Nearly 120 friendly societies are authorised to
accept new business.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card
arrangements, the main payment systems are
run by three separate companies operating
under an umbrella organisation, the

Association for Payment Clearing Services
(APACS). One system covers bulk paper
clearings—cheques and credit transfers. A
second deals with high-value clearings for
same-day settlement, namely the nationwide
electronic transfer service, Clearing House
Automated Payment System (CHAPS). A
third covers bulk electronic clearing for
standing orders and direct debits.
Membership of each company is open to any
bank, building society or other financial
institution meeting criteria for appropriate
supervision and volume of transactions; 22
banks and building societies are members of
one or more clearing companies.
Trends in Financial Transactions
There have been major changes in the nature
of financial transactions in recent years. Plastic
cards, which first started to appear in 1966,
have become much more widespread, with 97
million in circulation in Britain; 83 per cent of
adults have one or more cards. Cash, though,
continues to be the most popular form of
payment in terms of the volume of
transactions—about two-thirds of payments
above £1 are made in cash. The use of
cheques has been declining during the 1990s
(see Table 16.1), as cards have increased in
popularity.
The installation of ATMs has greatly
improved consumers’ access to cash,
particularly outside bank opening hours. The
number of ATMs has more than doubled in
the last ten years, to 22,100 in 1996. All the
major retail banks and building societies
participate in nationwide networks of ATMs.
There were 1,600 million cash withdrawals
from ATMs in 1996, the average withdrawal
being £50.
Plastic Cards
The main types of plastic card are cheque
guarantee cards, debit cards, credit cards,
charge cards and cash cards. Individual cards
frequently cover more than one use, such as a
cheque guarantee and cash card.
Cheque guarantee cards entitle holders to
cheque-cashing facilities in participating
239
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
institutions, and guarantee retailers that
transactions up to the specified guarantee
limit—typically £50 or £100—will be
honoured. Eurocheques supported by a
eurocheque card are available from major
banks and may be used to obtain cash or make
payments throughout the EU and in a few
other overseas countries; cheques are made
out in the currency of the country in which
they are being used.
Most credit cards are affiliated to one of the
major international organisations, Visa and
MasterCard. At the end of 1996, there were 33
million credit cards issued by banks and
building societies in use in Britain: 20 million
Visa cards and 13 million MasterCards.
Barclays is by far the largest issuer, with over 9
million. There are a growing number of
‘affinity’ cards, where the card is linked to an
organisation such as a charity or trade union.
Charge cards are similar to credit cards, but are
designed to be paid off in full each month; they
are usually available only to those with
relatively high incomes or assets. Several major
retailers issue store cards for use within their
own outlets.
The use of debit cards has increased rapidly
since their introduction in 1987. Some 62 per
cent of adults in Britain hold a debit card, and
nearly 33 million have been issued. Payments
are deducted directly from the purchaser’s
current account. There are three debit card
schemes in operation: Switch, Visa Delta and
Visa Electron.
Electronic Banking
Many banks and building societies offer home
banking services, whereby customers use a
telephone to obtain account information, make
transfers and pay bills. Some banks and building
societies offer a home banking service for
customers via a personal computer. Other
innovations include banking services over the
Internet and self-service kiosks containing
ATMs and video links to banks’ central facilities.
The most recent development is the trial in a
number of locations of Mondex, a new type of
electronic card, which is ‘charged’ with money
from the card holder’s bank account. These
cards can be used to purchase goods or services
at participating retailers through electronic tills.
National Savings
National Savings, an executive agency of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a source of
finance for government borrowing and aims to
encourage saving by offering personal savers a
range of investments. Certain National
Savings products provide tax-free returns. In
May 1997 the total amount invested in
National Savings was £62,000 million. Sales
of National Savings products totalled £13,354
million in 1996-97. After allowing for
repayments, the net contribution to
government funding was £4,804 million. The
largest contributions were made by Pensioners
Bonds and Premium Bonds, with net
additions to funding of £2,480 million and
£1,710 million respectively.
Other important products include:
• Savings Certificates, which pay either a
fixed rate of interest alone or a lower
fixed rate of interest combined with
index-linking (rising in line with the
Retail Prices Index);
• Income and Capital Bonds;
• Children’s Bonus Bonds, designed to
accumulate capital sums for those under
21;
• Ordinary and Investment Accounts,
where deposits and withdrawals can be
made at post offices throughout Britain;
and
• FIRST Option Bonds, which offer a
guaranteed rate of interest fixed for one
year.
INSURANCE
London is the world’s leading centre for
insurance and international reinsurance. It
handles an estimated 20 per cent of the general
insurance business placed on the international
market. EC directives to create a single
European market in insurance came into force
in 1994. As well as the British companies and
the Lloyd’s market (see below), many overseas
firms are represented, with which British
companies have formed close relationships.
Authorised insurance companies are
supervised by the DTI under the Insurance
Companies Act 1982.
240
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Main Types of Insurance
There are two broad categories of insurance:
long-term life insurance, where contracts may
be for periods of many years; and general
insurance, including accident and short-term
health insurance, where contracts are for a
year or less.
Long-term Insurance
As well as providing life cover, life insurance
is a vehicle for saving and investment because
premiums are invested in securities and other
assets. About 65 per cent of households have
life assurance cover. Total long-term
insurance assets under management by
companies in 1996 were £600,000 million on
behalf of their worldwide operations. Long¬
term insurance is handled by around 220
companies.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by underwriters at
Lloyd’s. It includes fire, accident, general
liability, motor, marine, aviation and transport
risks. Total worldwide premium income of
members of the Association of British Insurers
(ABI) in 1996 was £35,000 million, of which
£22,000 million was earned in Britain.
Structure of the Industry
At the end of 1996, over 800 companies were
authorised to carry on one or more classes of
insurance business in Britain. Around 450
companies belong to the ABI.
The industry includes both public limited
companies and mutual institutions—companies
owned by their policyholders. Among the
largest insurance companies are Commercial
Union, Prudential, General Accident, Royal &
Sun Alliance, and Norwich Union.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the
17th century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. It is not a
As with banks and building societies, the
insurance industry is undergoing a series of
major changes, affecting both the services
supplied and the structure of the industry.
In June 1997, Norwich Union ceased to be
a mutual institution when it floated on the
London Stock Exchange; it is now the
third largest publicly quoted insurance
company. Its 2.9 million members received
shares in the flotation. Another mutual
insurer, Scottish Amicable, has been taken
over by the Prudential.
company but a market for insurance
administered by the Council of Lloyd’s and
Lloyd’s Regulatory and Market Boards.
The premium income of the market in 1996
was approximately £8,000 million. For 1997
the market has a total capacity of £10,300
million, which is provided by around 10,000
members who are underwriting through 164
syndicates. Each syndicate is managed by an
underwriting agent responsible for appointing
a professional underwriter to accept insurance
risks and manage claims on behalf of the
members of the syndicate. With the exception
of motor insurance business, insurance may
only be placed through the 201 Lloyd’s-
registered broking companies, which negotiate
with Lloyd’s syndicates on behalf of the
insured. Reinsurance constitutes a large part
of Lloyd’s business—more than 6 per cent of
the world’s reinsurance is placed at Lloyd’s.
Around one-third of Lloyd’s current business
is in its traditional marine market, and Lloyd’s
also has a significant share of the British motor
insurance market, insuring about 15 per cent
of British motorists. Lloyd’s is also a major
insurer of aviation and satellite risks, and
underwrites in all other areas of insurance.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s,
Lloyd’s suffered severe losses, partly caused
by a series of natural disasters and claims
arising from asbestosis and pollution. The
Council of Lloyd’s took action to reconstruct
the market, securing an injection of new
capital from interested parties, and reinsuring
the liabilities arising from 1992 and previous
underwriting years into a new company,
Equitas.
241
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The market has returned to profitability,
and is continuing to develop following its
reconstruction. An increasing share of capacity
is being provided by corporate members with
limited liability rather than the traditional
individual ‘Names’—wealthy individuals who
accept insurance risks for their own profit or
loss, with unlimited liability. Lloyd’s is
strengthening the financial requirements on all
members in order to increase the security of
the market and enhance the confidence of
policyholders.
Institute of London Underwriters
The Institute of London Underwriters,
formed in 1884 as a trade association for
marine underwriters, provides a market where
member insurance companies transact marine,
energy, commercial transport and aviation
business. It issues combined policies in its own
name on risks underwritten by member
companies. Gross premium income processed
by the Institute for its member companies in
1996 was £1,500 million. About half of the 55
member companies are branches or
subsidiaries of overseas companies.
Insurance Brokers and Other
Intermediaries
Insurance brokers, who act on behalf of the
insured, are a valuable part of the company
market and play an essential role in the Lloyd’s
market. Smaller brokers mainly deal with the
general public or specialise in a particular type
of commercial insurance. Medium to large
brokers almost exclusively handle commercial
insurance, with the biggest dealing in risks
worldwide. Some brokers specialise in
reinsurance business. Registration and
regulation of individuals and firms practising as
insurance brokers are conducted by the
Insurance Brokers Registration Council, under
a statutory regime of professional standards
which is obligatory for those who use the title
‘insurance broker’. Some 15,800 individuals are
registered with the Council, the majority of
whom are employed by about 2,200 limited
companies. Nearly 2,000 individuals carry on
business in their own right, trading as sole
proprietor, or in partnership.
All intermediaries who advise on, or
arrange, life insurance falling within the scope
of the Financial Services Act 1986 are subject
to regulation under the Act, mainly through
the Personal Investment Authority (see p.
234), on their conduct of business.
Other independent intermediaries may also
arrange insurance, but are not allowed to use
the title ‘insurance broker’. There are about
6,000 independent intermediaries operating
under the ABI’s code of practice.
INVESTMENT
Britain has a great deal of expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on behalf of investors, or advising investors
how best to invest their funds. The main types
of investment fund include pension schemes,
life assurance, unit trusts, investment trusts
and new open-ended investment companies
(oeics).
An analysis of the fund management
industry identified assets totalling more than
£1,800,000 million at the end of 1995 (see
Table 16.2), of which over a quarter were
managed on behalf of overseas clients. The
industry is estimated to contribute £2,700
million a year to GDP and to generate £425
million in overseas earnings. London is the
second largest fund management centre in
the world after Tokyo.
Pension Funds
Over 11 million people belong to occupational
pension schemes and more than 5 million to
personal pension schemes. Most occupational
pension schemes pay benefits related to final
salary, although a growing number are on a
‘money purchase’ basis where benefits depend
on the size of the accrued funds. Benefits are
normally funded in advance by employer and
employee contributions, which are held and
invested by trustees on behalf of beneficiaries.
Pension funds are major investors in securities
markets, holding around 30 per cent of
securities listed on the London Stock
Exchange. Total British pension fund net

assets were worth about £566,000 million at
the end of 1996.
Unit Trusts
Around 1,700 authorised unit trusts (open-
ended collective funds) pool investors’ money,
and divide funds into units of equal size,
enabling people with relatively small amounts
to benefit from diversified and managed
portfolios. The industry has grown rapidly
during the last decade, and in the five years to
1997 total funds under management more
than doubled, to £163,000 million. Some are
general funds, investing in a wide variety of
British or international securities, and there
are also many specialist trusts.
Over 40 unit trust management groups
have total fund values of more than £1,000
million. The largest is Schroder Unit Trusts
Ltd, which manages 34 funds, with a total
fund value of £14,180 million in August 1997.
Unit trust management groups are
represented by the Association of Unit Trusts
and Investment Funds.
Open-ended Investment Companies
: 5 new type of scheme—open-ended
investment companies—has become available
in 1997. Oeics are similar to unit trusts, but an
nvestor in an oeic buys shares rather than units
n the company. The new schemes should
enable British companies to compete on an
equal footing with similar schemes operating
elsewhere in the EU. The first oeic was
launched by Global Asset Management in May
1997. Several unit trust management groups
are looking at oeics with a view to converting
and rationalising some of their funds.
Investment Trusts
Investment trust companies, which also offer
the opportunity to diversify risk on a relatively
small lump-sum investment or through regular
savings, are listed on the London Stock
Exchange and their shares are traded in the
usual way. They must invest mostly in
securities, and the trusts themselves are exempt
from tax on gains realised within the funds.
Assets are purchased mainly out of
shareholders’ funds, although investment trusts
are also allowed to borrow money for
investment. There were 322 members of the
Association of Investment Trust Companies in
June 1997, with £58,400 million of assets under
management. The three largest trusts are the
venture capital company 3i Group, Foreign &
Colonial Investment Trust, and Alliance Trust.
Share Ownership
Prior to 1997, about 10 million adults—22 per
cent of the adult population in Great
Britain—held shares. Privatisation (see p.
243
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
186), employee share schemes (see p. 180),
Personal Equity Plans and, more recently,
building society flotations have been among
the factors increasing share ownership. The
number of investment clubs—groups of
individuals, usually around 15 to 20 people,
who regularly invest in shares—has grown to
around 1,600.
During 1997 share ownership rose
considerably as a result of the demutualisation
of five building societies and the Norwich
Union insurance company (see pp. 237 and
241). About 16 million members received
shares, many having shares in more than one
institution. Although around one-quarter of
the new shareholders in the three largest
building society flotations—the Halifax,
Woolwich, and Alliance & Leicester—elected
to sell their shares immediately, most have
retained their shares.
Personal Equity Plans
Personal Equity Plans (PEPs) allow tax-free
investment in shares, including investment
trust companies, in unit trusts, and in certain
corporate bonds (except those issued by
financial services companies), preference
shares and ‘convertibles’ (bonds or preference
shares which can eventually be converted into
a company’s ordinary shares). Up to £6,000 in
a single tax year may be invested in a general
PEP and up to £3,000 in a single company
PEP. Dividends and capital gains on assets
held in a PEP are exempt from income tax and
capital gains tax, and withdrawals from PEPs
are normally tax free.
Since their introduction in 1987, nearly
£42,000 million had been invested in over 12
million PEPs by April 1997. PEPs are likely to
be absorbed within the new individual savings
accounts, which are expected to start in 1999.
The Government is developing plans for these
new accounts, which will extend the principles
of TESSAs (see p. 233) and PEPs, and
encourage long-term savings, especially among
those on low incomes.
SPECIAL FINANCING INSTITUTIONS
Several specialised institutions offer finance
and support to personal and corporate sector
borrowers. Among public sector agencies are
Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, the Welsh Development Agency,
the Industrial Development Board for
Northern Ireland (see pp. 197-8) and ECGD
(see p. 209). The main private sector
institutions are described below.
Finance and Leasing Companies
The Finance and Leasing Association
represents the interests of firms offering
motor finance, consumer credit, and business
finance and leasing. Its 106 full members
undertook new business worth £50,000
million in 1996.
Credit Unions
Credit unions—non-profit-making savings and
loans bodies—are less widespread in Britain
than in some other countries. However, they
have grown rapidly during the 1990s, and there
are now more than 700, with total assets of over
£300 million.
Factoring Companies
Factoring comprises a range of financial
services allowing companies to obtain finance
in exchange for outstanding invoices not yet
paid. During the 1990s the factoring and
discounting industry has been growing at over
20 per cent a year. The industry provides
working capital to more than 19,000
businesses a year. Member companies of the
Factors & Discounters Association handled
business worth £40,400 million in 1996.
Venture Capital Companies
The British venture capital industry is the
largest and most developed in Europe.
Venture capital companies offer medium- and
long-term equity financing for new and
developing businesses, management buy-outs
and buy-ins, and company rescues. The
British Venture Capital Association has 101
full members, which account for 95 per cent o!
annual venture capital investment in Britain.
Worldwide investment by British venture
244
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
capital firms rose by 28 per cent in 1996 to a
record £3,239 million, of which £2,806
million was invested in Britain; investments
were made in 1,200 businesses.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
The City of London’s financial markets
include the London Stock Exchange, the
foreign exchange market, the financial futures
and options market, eurobond and
eurocurrency markets, Lloyd’s insurance
market (see p. 241), and bullion and
commodity markets. The securities markets
are supervised jointly by the Treasury, the
Bank of England, FSA and the London Stock
Exchange, among others (see p. 234).
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange plays a vital role
in maintaining London’s position as a major
financial centre. It is one of the top three
global exchanges. The Exchange is based in
London, and there are regional representatives
in Belfast, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and
Manchester. As a result of a set of legal
reforms implemented in 1986 known as the
‘Big Bang’, the Exchange has changed
considerably over recent years. The most
fundamental change has been the move away
from the traditional market floor to screen-
based trading.
At the end of 1996, 2,171 British and 533
international companies were listed on the
main market, with a market capitalisation of
£1,011,700 million and £2,388,300 million
espectively. Turnover rose to record levels in
1996: £741,600 million for British equities and
£1,039,200 million for international equities.
The market is now undergoing a period of
:hange considered the most significant since
he ‘Big Bang’. The Exchange introduced an
dectronic order book in October 1997. This is
i new trading service, through which share
ransactions between buyers and sellers are
matched automatically, rather than being
>assed through market-making firms under
he current ‘quote-driven’ system. Initially, it
s limited to the most liquid stocks—the top
00 shares.
AIM, the Alternative Investment Market,
was established by the London Stock
Exchange in 1995, for small, young and
growing companies wishing to raise capital
and increase their profile. By August 1997
over 290 companies, with a total capitalisation
exceeding £5,000 million, had joined AIM
and had raised more than £1,000 million.
Tradepoint, a computer-based, order-driven
share dealing system in competition with the
London Stock Exchange, also started
operation in 1995.
In April 1997 CREST, a new computerised
settlement system for shares and other
securities developed by a project team from
the Bank of England, took over the settlement
of all securities traded in Britain. This is
expected to increase efficiency and lower the
cost by eliminating much of the paperflow.
CREST is owned and operated by CRESTCo,
a private sector consortium representing a
wide spread of City interests.
The gilts market (see p. 167) allows the
Government to raise money by issuing gilt-
edged stock. The London Stock Exchange
offers a secondary or trading market where
investors can buy or sell gilts. Turnover in the
market rose by 26 per cent in 1996 to a record
£1,983,000 million.
Money Markets
The London money markets comprise the
interbank deposit markets plus a range of
other instruments, usually short term in
maturity. Banks are the major participants in
these markets.
Euromarkets
Euromarkets operate for currencies lent or
invested outside their domestic marketplace,
particularly as a means of financing
international trade and investment.
Transactions can thus be carried out in
eurodollars, eurodeutschemarks, euroyen and
so on. London is at the heart of the
euromarkets and houses most of the leading
international banks and securities firms.
Distinctions between markets have been
breaking down and euromarkets form a major
part of the wider international money and
245
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
capital markets. Participants include
multinational trading corporations, financial
companies, governments, and international
organisations like the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank.
The euro-securities markets have grown
considerably in recent years because the
instruments traded on them—eurobonds,
euro-medium-term notes (EMTNs), euro¬
commercial paper and so on—are seen as
flexible alternatives to bank loans. There is a
growing market in ECU-denominated
deposits, securities and eurobonds.
Foreign Exchange Market
London is the world’s biggest centre for
foreign exchange trading, accounting for about
30 per cent of global net daily turnover in
foreign exchange. Average daily turnover in
London amounted to about £294,000 million
in 1995.
The foreign exchange market consists of
telephone and electronic links between the
participants, which include banks, other
financial institutions and several foreign
exchange broking firms acting as
intermediaries. It provides those engaged in
international trade and investment with
foreign currencies for their transactions. The
banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying
and selling rates for both immediate (‘spot’)
and forward transactions in a variety of
currencies and maturities. The forward
market enables traders and dealers who, at a
given date in the future, wish to receive or
make a specific foreign currency payment, to
contract in advance to sell or buy the foreign
currency involved for sterling at a fixed
exchange rate.
Derivatives
Financial derivatives are contracts to buy or
sell, at a future date, financial instruments such
as equities, bonds or money-market
instruments. Their use has grown rapidly,
especially among companies and investment
institutions, and instruments have become
more complex, as advances have been made in
information technology. Derivatives offer a
means of protection against changes in prices,
exchange rates and interest rates. They include:
• futures—agreements to buy or sell
financial instruments or physical
commodities at a future date;
• options—the right to buy or sell financial
instruments or physical commodities for
a stated period at a predetermined price;
and
• ‘over-the-counter’ products, including
swaps—a foreign exchange swap can
convert a money-market instrument in
one currency into a money-market
instrument in another.
Financial Futures and Options
Commodity and financial futures and options I
are traded at the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(LIFFE), the largest futures and options
exchange in Europe. There are over 220
member firms, including many of the world’s
leading financial institutions. Its trading floor
in the City contains one of the world’s most
modern ‘open outcry’ trading facilities, with
members executing their business through a
system of hand signals and shouting on the
trading floor.
Business on LIFFE reached a new annual
record in 1996, when 168 million futures and
options contracts were traded, 27 per cent
higher than in 1995. In the first half of 1997
business grew further, and over 100 million
contracts were traded—an average daily
volume of around 814,000. LIFFE is
continuing to strengthen its links with other
exchanges; in May 1997 it joined with the
Chicago Bqard of Trade (the world’s largest
futures exchange) in a link covering trading of
the world’s two biggest debt contracts. In 1996
LIFFE merged with the London Commodity 1
Exchange, where trading includes contracts in
coffee, cocoa, sugar, grain, potatoes and the
dry freight index.
.
London Bullion Market
London is the hub of the international bullion !
market. Around 60 banks and other financial
246
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
trading companies participate in the London
gold and silver markets, which trade by
telephone or other electronic means. Members
of the London Bullion Market Association
meet twice daily to establish a London fixing
price for gold—a reference point for
worldwide dealings. The silver fixing is held
once a day. Although much interest centres on
the fixings, active dealing takes place
throughout the day.
Commodity, Shipping and Freight
Markets
Britain is a major international centre for
commodities trading and the home of many
related international trade organisations. The
London Metal Exchange is the primary base
metals market in the world, trading contracts
in aluminium, aluminium alloy, copper, lead,
nickel, tin and zinc. The International
Petroleum Exchange is Europe’s only energy
futures exchange. The Baltic Exchange, which
finds ships for cargoes and cargoes for ships
throughout the world, is the world’s leading
international shipping market.
Other Services
BUSINESS SERVICES
Exhibition and Conference Centres
Britain is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences—the
others being the United States and France.
London and Paris are the two most popular
conference cities. A large number of other
towns and cities in Britain—including several
traditional seaside holiday resorts wishing to
diversify and take advantage of the growing
business tourism market—have facilities for
conferences and exhibitions.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre in
Birmingham; the Queen Elizabeth II and
Olympia Conference Centres, both in
London; and Cardiff International Arena, a
5,000-seat multi-purpose facility. In Scotland,
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen have
niajor exhibition and conference centres. The
£29 million Belfast Waterfront Hall opened in
1997. Brighton (East Sussex), Harrogate
(North Yorkshire), Bournemouth (Dorset),
Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham and
Torquay (Devon) all have exhibition and
conference centres. Other important
exhibition facilities are situated in London at
the Barbican, Earls Court, Alexandra Palace
and Wembley Arena.
Many of the larger sites belong to a
marketing group, Conventions Great Britain.
Computing Services
The computing services industry comprises
businesses engaged in software development;
production of packaged software; consultancy;
information technology ‘outsourcing’;
processing services; and the provision of
complete computer systems. It also includes
companies that provide information
technology (IT) education and training;
independent maintenance; support,
contingency planning and recruitment; and
contract staff. The turnover of companies in
the Computing Services & Software
Association, which represents about 80 per
cent of the industry in Britain, totalled
£11,000 million in 1996.
British firms and universities have
established strong reputations in software
R & D. A number of international IT
conglomerates have set up R & D operations
in Britain—among them are Hitachi, IBM,
Nortel, Philips and Sharp. US software
company Computer Associates has announced
plans to build a new £100 million European
headquarters at Datchet, near Heathrow
Airport. Microsoft intends to make a major
R & D investment at Cambridge (see p. 340).
Academic expertise is particularly evident in
such areas as artificial intelligence, neural
networks, formal programming for safety
critical systems, and parallel programming
systems. Software firms have developed
strengths in sector-specific applications,
including systems for retailing, banking,
finance and accounting, medical and dental
industries, and the travel and entertainment
industries. The market leader in Britain for
‘point-of-sale’ systems is ICL. Specialist
‘niche’ markets in which Britain’s software
247
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
producers are active include artificial
intelligence, scientific and engineering
software, especially computer-aided design,
mathematical software, geographical
information systems, and data visualisation
packages. Firms specialise in devising
multimedia software. Distance learning,
‘virtual reality’ and computer animation all
benefit from a large pool of creative talent.
British-based companies are achieving
outstanding sales in the United States. All-
Voice Computing is a market leader in
devising software for voice-activated word¬
processing.
One of the biggest users of software is the
telecommunications industry. The major
telecommunications operators and several
specialist companies are active in this sector.
The provision of almost all new
telecommunications services is dependent on
software; switching and transmission, for
example, are primarily digital and controlled
by software. Teleshopping, video-on-demand,
payphones and answering services are also
now software-based.
Market Research
The market research profession in Britain has
developed strongly in the past decade or so,
and now accounts for 10 per cent of worldwide
market research spending. It has a wide range
of domestic and overseas clients, including
government bodies.
Management Consultancy
Britain’s 27,000 management consultants
supply technical assistance and advice to
business and government clients. Typically,
consultants identify and investigate problems
and opportunities, recommend appropriate
action and help to implement
recommendations. Many British-based
consultancies operate internationally; the most
recent trend has been for the biggest firms to
set up offices in Eastern Europe and the
Pacific Rim. The 31 member firms of the
Management Consultancies Association are
among the largest in the industry and account
for more than half of management consultancy
work. They range from Andersen Consulting
and CMG Management, with a strong
technical bias, to Coopers & Lybrand and PA
Consulting group, which specialise in
market/industry sectors. In 1996 member
firms earned over £ 1,400 million in Britain
and £236 million overseas.
Advertising and Public Relations
Britain is a major centre for creative
advertising, and multinational corporations
often use advertising created in Britain for
marketing their products globally. British
agencies have strong foreign links through
overseas ownership and associate networks.
Spending on advertising in 1996 amounted
to £11,900 million, up 9 per cent on the
previous year. The press accounted for 54 per
cent of the total, television for 28 per cent,
direct mail for 12 per cent, and posters,
transport, commercial radio and cinema for
the rest. The largest advertising expenditure is
on food, household durables, cosmetics, office
equipment, motor vehicles and financial
services. Among the biggest spenders in 1996
were BT, Dixons, McDonalds, Tesco,
J. Sainsbury, the National Lottery (see
p. 47) and the major car manufacturers.
British television advertising receives many
international awards.
Campaigns are planned by around 2,000
advertising agencies. In addition to their
creative, production and media buying roles,
some agencies offer integrated marketing
services, such as consumer research (see
above) and public relations. Many have
sponsorship departments, which arrange for
businesses to sponsor products and events,
including artistic, sporting and charitable
events. In return for financial or other
support, the sponsoring company is associated
with a worthy product or event, thereby
raising its profile with consumers. Leading
agencies include Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO,
J. Walter Thompson, Leo Burnett, and Ogilvy
and Mather Advertising.
Government advertising campaigns—on
crime prevention, health promotion, armed
services recruitment and so on—are often
organised by the Central Office of
Information, an executive agency of the
Government (see p. 535), which is able to
248
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
secure substantial discounts because of its
centralised buying power.
Britain’s public relations industry has
grown rapidly over the past ten years and is
now the most developed in Europe.
DISTRIBUTION AND SALES
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale by road, rail, air
and sea is a major economic activity. The large
wholesalers and retailers operate, either
directly or through contractors, extensive
distribution networks.
Wholesaling
In 1994 there were 117,800 businesses, with a
workforce of 800,000 and a turnover of
£296,900 million (see Table 16;3), engaged in
wholesaling and dealing in Great Britain.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Many small
wholesalers and independent grocery retailers
belong to voluntary ‘symbol’ groups (for
example, Spar, Landmark and Londis), which
operate under a corporate fascia and provide
access to central purchasing facilities and co¬
ordinated promotions. This has helped
smaller retailers to remain relatively
competitive; many local ‘corner shops’ and
village stores would not otherwise be able to
stay in business. Booker, Batleys and Bestways
are the major ‘cash and carry’ wholesalers.
London’s wholesale markets play a significant
part in the distribution of fresh foodstuffs.
New Covent Garden is the main market for
fruit and vegetables, Smithfield for meat and
Billingsgate for fish.
The Co-operative Wholesale Society
(CWS) is the principal supplier of goods and
services to the Co-operative Movement and
was a founder member of the Co-operative
Retail Trading Group. Formed in 1993 to act
as a central marketing, buying and distribution
partnership for retail co-operative societies,
the Group now accounts for around 65 per
cent of Co-op food trade. The CWS is also the
largest co-operative retailer in Europe, with
684 stores located in Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the east and south Midlands, and
south-east and north-east England. Retail co¬
operative societies are voluntary organisations
controlled by their members, membership
being open to anyone paying a small deposit
on a minimum share. Throughout the Co¬
operative Movement, which comprises 49
independent societies, there are nearly 2,500
stores.
Retailing
In 1994 there were 196,600 retail businesses,

people in Great Britain (see Table 16.4).
These range from national supermarket and
other retail chains to independent corner
grocery shops, hardware stores, chemists,
newsagents and a host of other types of
retailer. During recent years the large multiple
retailers have grown considerably, tending to
reduce numbers of stores but increase outlet
size and diversify product ranges. Some, such
as Marks & Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Tesco,
have acquired other retailers and made
franchise arrangements abroad. Small
independent retail businesses and co-operative
societies have been in decline for some time. _
Sunday trading laws have been relaxed to
allow retailers to open for specified periods on
Sundays; smaller retailers are permitted to
open for longer hours on Sundays than the
larger supermarkets and department stores, to
help their competitive position. The four main
supermarket chains are experimenting with
24-hour opening on selected days.
The biggest supermarket groups are Tesco,
J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Asda. Other large
food retailers include Marks & Spencer,
Morrisons, Iceland, Somerfield, Waitrose and
Kwik Save (the leading discount food retailer
in Britain). Several overseas discount food
retailers, such as Aldi of Germany and
Denmark’s Netto, have recently entered the
British market. Alcoholic drinks are sold
mainly in specialist ‘off licences’ and
supermarkets, which have roughly equal sales.
The principal off-licence chains are Cellar
Five, Oddbins, Threshers and Victoria Wine.
The leading mixed retail chains are found
in high streets nationwide. Among them are
Marks & Spencer (selling clothing and food
and drink in the main), Boots (pharmaceuticals
and cosmetic goods), F. W. Woolworth (a
variety of products, from clothing to
kitchenware), W. H. Smith (newspapers, books
and stationery), Argos (a very large range of
products that are ordered in the stores from a
catalogue and may be taken away by
customers), Dixons (consumer electronics),
John Menzies (newspapers, books and
stationery), Burton Group (clothing) and John
Lewis and Debenhams (a wide variety of
products, including furniture, clothing and
electrical goods).
Several chains of DIY (Do-It-Yourself)
stores and superstores cater for people carrying
out their own repairs and improvements on
250
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
their homes and gardens; they stock a broad
range of tools, decorating and building
materials, kitchen and bathroom fittings,
garden products and so on. The three biggest
are B&Q, Homebase and Do It All.
Vchicle, Vehicle Parts and Petrol Retailing
In 1997, 550,000 people were employed in
Great Britain in retailing motor vehicles and
parts, and in petrol stations. Many businesses
selling new vehicles are franchised by the motor
manufacturers. Vehicle components are
available for sale at garages which undertake
servicing and repair work and also at retail chains
like Halfords and independent retailers. Drive-in
fitting centres sell tyres, exhaust systems,
batteries, clutches and other vehicle parts; the
largest chains include Kwik-Fit and ATS.
Many petrol stations are owned by oil
companies. The three companies with the
highest number of outlets are Shell, Esso and
BP. Unleaded petrol accounts for about 70 per
cent of petrol sold. The vast majority of petrol
stations are self-service. The number of petrol
stations has been reduced by about a half in
the last decade or so as owners focus on larger
sites that can accommodate the broad range of
retail services, including food, that are now
commonly available at petrol stations. About
one-fifth of petrol sold in Britain comes from
supermarket forecourts.
Mail Order
All kinds of goods and services can be
purchased through mail order catalogues from
such firms as Great Universal Stores,
Littlewoods, Freeman’s, Grattan and Empire.
The largest selling items are clothing,
footwear, furniture, household textiles and
domestic electrical appliances.
Shopping Facilities
Britain has a wide choice of shopping facilities.
Government policy is to encourage a balanced
mixture of facilities that will satisfy the needs
of all consumers, whether they have access to a
car or not, and enable businesses of all sizes
and types to prosper.
The pre-recorded video retail market has
shown exceptional growth since the mid-
1980s, when it was virtually non-existent:
in 1996 total sales reached over £800
million, 8 per cent more than in 1995. The
video version of Independence Day, one of
Hollywood’s most successful feature films
in recent years, has sold more than 1
million copies in Britain.
The Government is intensifying efforts to
help revitalise shopping and other facilities in
town centres. One of the most significant trends
in retailing has been the spread of superstores,
many of which have been built away from urban
centres in recent years. Social, economic and
environmental considerations have led
government planning authorities to try to limit
large-scale new retail developments, especially
those outside urban centres, which could
undermine the viability of existing town centres
and further encroach on the countryside and
encourage greater car use. All new retail
development requires planning permission from
the local government planning authority. These
authorities must consult central government
before granting permission for developments of
20,000 sq m (215,000 sq ft) or more.
Encouraged by the Government, the main
multiple grocery companies are turning their
attention back to town centres, redeveloping
existing stores and building smaller outlets.
Examples include Tesco’s ‘Metro’ format and
J. Sainsbury’s ‘Central’ stores.
Regional out-of-town shopping centres are
located on sites offering good road access and
ample parking facilities. One of the first was the
Metro Centre at Gateshead in north-east
England, which is currently the largest of its
kind in Europe. Other major centres include
Merry Hill at Dudley in the West Midlands,
Meadowhall in Sheffield and the Lakeside
Centre at Thurrock in Essex. The Trafford
Centre, now being built on the outskirts of
Manchester and due to open in 1998, will
contain 280 shops, 25 restaurants and a leisure
complex. Another new shopping and leisure
centre is being built at Bluewater Park near
Dartford, Kent; when this is completed, it will
be the biggest shopping centre in Europe.
About half of total food sales are accounted for
251
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
by superstores away from town centres,
compared with a fifth at the beginning of the
1980s.
Retailers of non-food goods, such as DIY
products, toys, furniture and electrical
appliances, sportswear, and office and computer
products, have also built outlets away from
urban centres. There is a continuing trend
towards grouping retail warehouses into retail
parks, often with food and other facilities,
although planning controls are now limiting
new approvals for such parks.
Other Trends
The large multiple groups tend to sell a much
greater number of goods and services than
previously. For example, large food retailers are
increasing their range of foods. Greater
emphasis has also been placed on selling own-
label goods (which now account for up to one-
half of sales) and environmentally friendly
products (including organic produce) and
household products and clothing. Many sell
fresh food, such as meat, fish, vegetables and, in
some cases, bread baked on the premises. In¬
store pharmacies, post offices and dry-cleaners
are now a feature of large supermarkets, which
have in recent times also begun selling books,
magazines, newspapers, pre-recorded video
cassettes (see p. 251) and recorded music.
‘Stores within stores’ are common; for example,
sportswear and sports goods retailers are to be
found in several of the big mixed retail
department stores, while Laura Ashley, the
furnishings and fabrics retailer, has facilities in
Homebase (a DIY chain owned by J.
Sainsbury). The major supermarket chains have
their own petrol stations at some of their bigger
outlets (see p. 251).
Several large retailers now offer personal
finance facilities for customers in an attempt to
encourage sales, particularly of high-value
goods. ‘Loyalty’ cards have also been
introduced by supermarket and other retail
groups, giving regular customers cash discounts
related to the size of their purchases.
Information Technology
Information technology is central to
distribution and retailing. Computers monitor
stock levels and record sales figures through
electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) systems.
EPOS systems read a bar-code printed on the
retail product that holds price and product
information and can be used to generate
orders for stock replenishment as well as
totalling up bills and providing a receipt for
customers. Techniques such as ‘just-in-time’
ordering, in which produce arrives at the store
at the last possible moment before sale, have
become widespread as a result. Leading
retailers have set up electronic data
interchange (EDI) systems; these enable their
computers to communicate with those of their
suppliers, and transmit orders and invoices
electronically, so reducing errors and saving
time.
EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at point
of sale) systems allow customers to pay for
purchases using debit cards which
automatically transfer funds from their bank
account. Several major EFTPOS schemes are
in operation and the number of terminals is
growing rapidly. ‘Superscan’ technology—
which involves customers using an electronic
scanning device to work out their own bills,
thus avoiding the need to queue at a check-
. out—is undergoing trials in a number of
supermarkets. Electronic home shopping,
using a television and telephone, and ‘online’
shopping, where personal computers are
linked to databases, are also being introduced.
Tesco and J. Sainsbury are among those
testing supermarket shopping using the
Internet.
Franchising
Nearly 500 franchisers operate in Britain, with
26,000 outlets. Franchising is a business in
which a company owning the rights to a
particular form of trading licenses them to
franchisees, usually by means of an initial
payment with continuing royalties. The main
areas are cleaning services, film processing,
print shops, hairdressing and cosmetics,
fitness centres, courier delivery, car rental,
engine tuning and servicing, and fast food
retailing. Familiar high street names include
McDonalds, Body Shop (environmentally
friendly cosmetics and other products) and
Kali Kwik (fast printing).
252
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Rental Services
A broad range of rental services, many
franchised, are on offer throughout Britain.
These include hire of cars and other vehicles,
televisions and video cassette recorders,
household appliances such as washing
machines and tumble dryers, tools and heavy
decorating equipment (ladders, floor sanders
and so on) and video films and computer
games. Retailing of many types of service is
dominated by chains, though independent
operators are still to be found in most fields.
Auction Houses
Britain attracts buyers and sellers from around
the world and has a long tradition of expertise
and innovation in auctioneering. Its chief
auction houses are active in the international
auction markets for works of art, trading on
their acknowledged expertise. The two leading
houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, are
established worldwide. The former handled
sales valued at £1,017 million in 1996, while
Christie’s sales amounted to £1,016 million.
Phillips and Bonhams are also prominent
auctioneers.
HOTELS, HOLIDAY CENTRES,
CATERING AND PUBLIC HOUSES
The hotel and catering trades, which include
public houses (pubs), wine bars and other
licensed bars, employ 1.3 million people in
Britain. The largest hotel business is Forte
Hotels, now owned by Granada Group, with
326 hotels in Britain. At the other end of the
scale, numerous guest houses and hotels
(many individually owned) have fewer than 20
rooms. Holiday centres, including holiday
camps with full board, self-catering centres
and caravan parks, are run by Butlins, Holiday
Club, Center Parcs, Warner Holidays and
Pontin’s.
Britain’s 100,000 restaurants offer cuisine
from virtually every country in the world; they
cater for the whole spread of income groups
and several of the highest quality ones have
international reputations. Chinese, Indian,
Thai, Italian, French and Greek restaurants
are among the most popular. ‘Fast food’
restaurants, an area where franchising plays a
significant role, are widespread. They
specialise in selling hamburgers, chicken,
pizza and a variety of other foods (some
specialising in foreign cuisine—Greek kebabs,
for instance), to be eaten on the premises or
taken away. The most well-known nationwide
chains include McDonalds (hamburgers),
Burger King (hamburgers), KFC (chicken),
Pizza Hut and Pizza Express. Traditional fish
and chip shops are another main provider of
cooked take-away food. Sandwich bars are
common in towns and cities, typically in areas
with high concentrations of office workers.
In 1996 sandwiches accounted for 30 per cent
of the fast food market, hamburgers 24 per
cent, fish and chips 17 per cent, pizzas 13 per
cent, ethnic food (Chinese, Indian, Greek,
Mexican and so on) 10 per cent and chicken
5 per cent.
About 50,000 pubs sell beer, wines, soft
drinks and spirits to adults for consumption
on the premises, and most also serve hot and
cold food. Many pubs are owned by the large
brewing companies, which either provide
managers to run them or offer tenancy
agreements; these pubs tend to sell just their
own brands of beer, although some also offer
‘guest’ beers. Others, called ‘free houses’, are
independently owned and managed and
frequently serve a variety of beers. W ine bars
are normally smaller than pubs and tend to
specialise in wine and food; they more closely
resemble bars in other parts of Europe.
Pubs and bars are permitted by law to open
from 11.00 to 23.00 from Monday to Saturday
(on Sunday they may open between 12.00 and
22.30). The introduction of liquor licences for
cafe-style premises allows children under 14 to
accompany adults to selected places where
alcoholic drinks are served.
TOURISM, TRAVEL AND LEISURE
Tourism is one of the key growth sectors,
contributing £38,000 million annually to the
economy (equivalent to over 5 per cent of
GDP). In the region of 1.8 million people are
employed in tourism and related activities; of
these, around 200,000 are self-employed. Over
200,000 businesses, mainly independent small
ones—hotels and guest houses, restaurants,
253
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
holiday homes, caravan and camping parks
and so on—are responsible for providing the
bulk of tourism services; about 8 per cent of
small businesses are engaged in tourism.
Although its share of world tourism
earnings fell in the ten years to 1994, it began
to rise again in 1995—reaching 5 per cent in
1996. While more than 50 per cent of overseas
tourists spend all or almost all of their visit in
London, others venture further afield to see
the many attractions in the English regions as
well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Channel Tunnel has improved access to
many of Britain’s tourist attractions. It is one
of the reasons France has become the country
sending the largest number of overseas
tourists to Britain.
Domestic tourism was worth around
£14,000 million in 1996 (see p. 48). Of British
residents opting to take their main holiday in
Britain, 38 per cent choose a traditional
seaside destination, such as Blackpool
(Lancashire), Bournemouth (Dorset), Great
Yarmouth (Norfolk) and resorts in Devon and
Cornwall. Short holiday breaks (one to three
nights), valued at £2,600 million in 1996,
make up an increasingly significant part of the
market.
Britain’s historic towns and cities and its
scenic rural and coastal areas continue to have
great appeal for British and overseas tourists
alike. There is a growing interest in heritage,
arts and culture; attractions include museums,
art galleries, historic buildings and
monuments, and theatres, as well as shopping,
sports and business facilities. Domestic and
foreign tourists play an increasingly important
role in supporting Britain’s national heritage
and creative arts, in addition to the large
financial contribution they make to hotels,
restaurants, cafes and bars, and public
transport. Business travel is accounting for a
growing share of the tourism market; it
includes attendance at conferences,
exhibitions, trade fairs and other business
sites. Activity holidays—based on walking,
canoeing, mountain climbing, or artistic
activities, for example—are becoming more
popular. The Youth Hostel Association
operates a comprehensive network of hostels
offering young people and families a range of
affordable facilities, including self-catering.
The number of overseas visitors coming to
Britain has more than doubled in the last
20 years. In 1996 a record 25.3 million—
over 7 per cent more than in 1995-—spent
almost £12,400 million. An estimated 67
per cent were from Western Europe and
15 per cent from North America. Business
travel accounts for about £3,500 million,
27 per cent of all overseas tourism revenue.
‘Theme parks’ attract more than 15 million
visitors a year. Alton Towers (Staffordshire),
Chessington World of Adventures and
Thorpe Park (both in Surrey) are three of the
biggest; 2.7 million people visited Alton
Towers in 1996-97, the largest number of
visitors for any paid-for tourist attraction (see
Table 2.3, p. 11). Legoland near Windsor in
Berkshire is the newest theme park. As well as
spectacular ‘white knuckle’ rides and
attractions and overhead cable cars and
railways, some parks also feature displays of
domesticated and wild animals.
Most British holiday-makers wishing to go
overseas buy ‘package holidays’ from travel
agencies, where the cost covers both transport
and accommodation. The most popular
package holiday destinations are Spain, France
and Greece. Long-haul holidays to places like
the United States, the Caribbean and
Australia have gained in popularity as air fares
have come down. Winter skiing holidays to
resorts in Austria, France, Italy and
Switzerland and other countries inside and
outside Europe continue to attract large
numbers of Britons.
Around 80 per cent of travel agencies are
members of the Association of British Travel
Agents (ABTA). Although most are small
businesses, a few large firms, such as Lunn
Poly and Thomas Cook, have hundreds of
branches. Some 630 tour operators are
members of ABTA; about half are both retail
agents and tour operators. ABTA operates
financial protection schemes to safeguard its
members’ customers and maintains codes of
conduct drawn up with the Office of Fair
Trading (see p. 191). It also offers a free
consumer affairs service to help resolve
complaints against members and a low-cost
254
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
independent arbitration scheme for members’
customers. The British Incoming Tour
Operators’ Association is the leading body
representing tour operators engaged in
incoming tourism to Britain.
Tourism Promotion
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport is responsible for tourism in England,
and the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland
Offices have responsibility for tourism in their
respective countries. The government-
supported British Tourist Authority (BTA)
promotes Britain overseas as a tourist
destination through 43 offices in 37 countries
and encourages the development of tourist
facilities in Britain to meet the needs of
overseas visitors. The tourist boards for
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, which also receive government
finance, support domestic tourism and work
with the BTA to promote Britain overseas.
The Government is working with the
tourism industry to raise standards of
accommodation and service, and to address
certain key issues facing the industry. These
include the industry’s communications
strategy; improving visitor attractions;
boosting business tourism; encouraging best
practice for the development of workforce
skills; and government-industry
communication.
The BTA and the national tourist boards
inform and advise the Government on issues
of concern to the industry. They also help
businesses and other organisations to plan by
researching and publicising trends affecting
the industry. The national tourist boards work
closely with regional tourist boards, on which
local government and business interests are
represented. There are over 800 local Tourist
Information Centres in Britain.
Accommodation classification and quality
grading schemes are operated by the national
tourist boards, including the Crown scheme for
hotels, guest houses, inns, bed and breakfast
and farmhouse holiday accommodation. A new
Lodge category has been introduced for
purpose-built accommodation alongside
motorways and other major roads. Common
standards are applied throughout Britain, and
all participating establishments are inspected
every year. By 2000 a new harmonised
accommodation rating scheme using
internationally recognised star symbols will be
adopted in England by the English Tourist
Board and the motoring organisations—the AA
and the RAC.
Eight tourism projects, principally
concentrating on staff training and developing
key tourism sectors, were awarded a total of
£2.5 million under the Government’s Sector
Challenge initiative (see p. 196) in May 1997.

Britain is self-sufficient in energy in net terms. In 1996 the energy industries
accounted for 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), 7 per cent of total
investment and 7 per cent of all expenditure on research and development.
Energy production directly employs 150,000 people—3.5 per cent of industrial
employment. In 1996 it produced a trade surplus in fuels of £4,300 million.
In 1996 combined oil and gas production again achieved a new high, up 7 per
cent on 1995. A record number of development wells were drilled. Competition is
well advanced in the gas and electricity supply industries and has recently been
extended to over 2 million residential gas consumers in England, with about 20
per cent switching from British Gas. The Government has issued a plan for a
more closely regulated water industry in England and Wales.

in 1996, while nuclear power provided 30 per
cent and oil and gas 25 per cent: In the second
quarter of 1997, nuclear power overtook coal
as the main fuel used.
In the early 1970s, energy imports
accounted for over 50 per cent of Britain’s
primary energy consumption, as recently
discovered oil and gas reserves were still being
developed. By 1981, Britain had become a net
exporter of energy, as oil and gas production
came on stream. Following the Piper Alpha

importer until 1993. In 1996 it exported 116.2
million tonnes of oil equivalent, and imported
78.2 million tonnes, generating an energy
trade surplus of £4,300 million, some £600
million higher than in 1995. Energy represents
6.5 per cent of British exports and 4 per cent
of imports.
ENERGY POLICY
The Government’s energy policy is to ensure
secure, diverse and sustainable supplies at
competitive prices. It believes that this is best
achieved by competition between suppliers in
open markets. The Government considers
that in the long run a balance needs to be
achieved between the demands of economic
growth and the necessity of reducing the
impact of energy-related emissions on the
environment. All this is as true for other
countries as it is for Britain.
By 1998 all British gas and electricity
markets will be opened up to full competition.
The independent regulators (see pp. 266 and
269) were put in place at privatisation and
have a duty to encourage the development of
competition and protect the interests of
consumers, by administering price controls
and enforcing standards of service in
remaining areas of monopoly. While supply
monopoly is receding as competition
advances, there will always be areas of natural
monopoly in the transmission/distribution
networks—the pipes and wires.
International Developments
The EU imports about 50 per cent of its
energy needs. Its White Paper published in
1995 sought to adapt energy policy to the
challenges the EU faces, taking account of the
rapid development of markets and what is
likely to happen on the international stage. It
also aimed to ensure further integration of the
EU internal energy market, based on the
principle of openness and competitiveness.
Energy and environmental objectives were to
be made more compatible, and member states
persuaded to make energy choices in
accordance with EU objectives. Wherever
possible, the full cost of energy production
and consumption was to be established openly
and reflected in prices. Another priority was
to undertake research and development (R &
D) into new, cleaner and more efficient energy
technologies. The R & D framework
programme has an R & D component, JOULE
(see p. 259), and a demonstration component,
THERMIE. They focus, among other things,
on energy security, environmental protection
and a close relation between R & D and the
energy markets.
The EU undertakes international technical
assistance programmes and co-financing in the
energy sector. For example, the ALURE
programme, in co-operation with the countries
of Latin America, encourages optimum use of
energy sources in the region. The EU also
collaborates with specialist international
organisations, such as the International Energy
Agency (IEA), in particular for crisis measures,
such as the obligation on member states to
maintain a minimum crude-oil and petroleum
product stock or to reduce consumption in
times of shortage.
An EC directive establishing the internal
market in electricity came into force in
February 1997. Most member states must
implement it within two years; it requires
them to introduce competition in generation
and phase in competition in supply. They
have to open 23 per cent of their market to
competition, rising to 28 per cent after three
years and 30 per cent after six.
Discussions of the rules concerning the
internal market in gas are nearing completion.
The Energy Charter treaty, signed in 1994
but not formally ratified, is being provisionally
applied. It creates a legal framework for energy
investment and trade with the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe and of the former
Soviet Union, and helps them to set up open
and non-discriminatory energy markets.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
In 1996 energy consumption in Britain was
only 9 per cent higher than in 1970, despite a
69 per cent increase in GDP; however, taking
account of temperature correction—which
shows what the annual consumption might
have been if the average temperature during
the year had been the same as the average for

the years 1961-90—consumption has risen for
the last four years in succession. Energy
consumption by final users in 1996 amounted
to 160.8 million tonnes of oil equivalent2 on an
‘energy supplied’ basis, of which transport
consumed 33 per cent, industrial users 23 per
cent, residential users 30 per cent, and
commerce, agriculture and public services 14
per cent.
Primary energy consumption grew by 6
per cent in 1996, the largest increase for over
30 years. The year was colder than normal,
however, and 1995 had been warmer. Final
energy consumption (including petroleum
products and secondary electricity, for
example) also increased, by 7 per cent over
1995: residential consumption was up 13 per
cent; industrial consumption up 4 per cent;
services up 6 per cent; and transport up 4
per cent.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
In 1996 energy consumption in Britain’s
housing, offices and industrial buildings was
worth about £22,985 million. The
Environmental and Energy Management
Directorate (EEMD) of the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR) estimates that at least 20 per cent
could be saved through investment in cost-
effective energy efficiency measures. Such
21 tonne of oil equivalent - 41.868 gigajoules.
improvements offer a means of reducing
carbon dioxide (C02) emissions. The EEMD
encourages investment in these improvements
through various programmes (see below). Its
budget for 1997-98 is £160 million.
The Energy Saving Trust is an
independent organisation which aims to
stimulate investment in energy efficiency and
is developing pilot schemes in the drive to
change the way consumers and providers
think about energy and its efficient use. The
Trust’s government funding for the three
years to 1999—2000 is £71.5 million. . |
Every new home in England and Wales is
now required to hold the Standard
Assessment Procedure (SAP) for home
energy rating, which demonstrates energy
efficiency and impact on the environment.
Similar standards will apply in Scotland from
early 1998. Retailers have to display energy
efficiency standard labels on refrigerators,
freezers, washing machines and tumble
dryers.
Environmental and Energy Management
Schemes
The Energy Efficiency Best Practice
programme, run by the Energy Technology
Support Unit for the DETR, prepares and
promotes authoritative information, with the
help of guides and case studies, on energy
efficiency techniques and technologies in
industry and buildings. As a result of the
258
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
programme, over £500 million a year of
energy savings have been made so far and
over 3 million tonnes of C02 emissions have
been avoided.
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme
(HEES) is the Government’s main domestic
energy efficiency programme in Great
Britain. It offers grants for loft insulation,
tank and pipe lagging, draught-proofing, and
energy advice. Over 2 million homes have
been insulated since the scheme started in
1991, and more than £350 million awarded in
grants.
HEES grants (average £160; maximum
£315) are available to householders who
receive income-related benefit; disability
allowances; or are aged 60 or more. Provision
for 1997-98 is £75 million. Households
getting grants can save about £45 in fuel costs
a year. Claimants with benefits or disability
allowances only contribute towards the cost of
the work if it is above maximum grant. Those
who qualify through age alone have to
contribute 75 per cent of the cost up to
maximum grant value.
Under the Small Company Environmental
and Energy Management Assistance Scheme
(SCEEMAS), government grants subsidise
40-50 per cent of the cost of consultancy help
to guide manufacturing companies through
the.EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
(see p. 346) in Britain. The grant applies to
firms with fewer than 250 employees, and an
annual turnover of less than £32 million.
The EU SAVE II programme (Specific
Actions for Vigorous Energy Efficiency),
adopted in December 1996, aims to stimulate
energy efficiency in industry and in the home
through funding of studies during 1996-2000.
Some 18 million ECUs have been'allocated
from the EU budget to SAVE II for 1997.
The EU normally provides up to 50 per cent
of the project costs.
ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
There is increasing awareness in Britain of the
environmental implications of the production
and use of energy. Although demand for
electricity has increased by an average of 2 per
cent a year since 1985 and generation is up by .
16 per cent, CO> emissions are falling (by 7 per
cent since 1990), largely because of changes in
the use of fuels for electricity generation.
Through SAVE and JOULE-THERMIE
(see above), the EU aims to develop a culture
of energy-saving behaviour and rational
energy consumption. These programmes play
a role in developing high energy efficiency and
new technologies for exploiting fossil fuels,
nuclear energy or renewable energy.
Climate Change
Britain’s second assessment report on climate
change, published in February 1997,
encourages cost-effective measures to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions—especially C02 .
and methane—and confirms that Britain is
likely to exceed its commitment to return
emissions of C02 and other greenhouse gases
to 1990 levels by 2000 (see chapter 21). The
Government has proposed a domestic target
of a 20 per cent reduction in C02 below 1990
levels by 2010.
The EU, with only 6 per cent of world
population, is responsible for about 16 per
cent of global energy-related C02 emissions.
The negotiating position at the Climate
Change Conference at Kyoto is for a 15 per
cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
below 1990 levels by 2010, with at least half
this being achieved by 2005. Within the EU,
a burden-sharing arrangement has been
agreed for the first 10 per cent of this, with
Britain’s share being a 10 per cent reduction.
Some member states’ emissions will be
allowed to rise to permit them to secure
further economic growth. A steady increase
in EU energy demand is likely despite the
assumption of a fall in energy intensity3 of 1.3
per cent in 1995-2005, and 1.6 per cent in
2005-2010. A problem arising from climate
change will be to try to decouple economic
growth and energy demand growth, which
have hitherto tended to march in step.
JEnergy intensity is defined as energy consumption per unit of
activity—not the same as energy efficiency because it is affected
by changes in the pattern of activity within a sector as well as by
genuine efficiency changes. For most sectors, however, changes in
intensity will owe much to changes in efficiency and can serve as a
reasonable proxy for them.

OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND
PRODUCTION
For centuries small quantities of oil have been
produced in mainland Britain, though by the
early 1960s this amounted to only 150,000
tonnes a year, about 0.3 per cent of refinery
output. Britain was almost wholly dependent
for its oil supplies on imports. The first
notable offshore discovery of oil (Arbroath
field) in the United Kingdom Continental
Shelf (UKCS) was made in 1969 and the first
oil brought ashore, from the Argyll field, in
1975. In 1996, output of crude oil and natural
gas liquids (NGLs) in Britain averaged 2.78
million barrels (about 355,700 tonnes) a day,
making Britain the world’s ninth largest
producer.
Structure of the Industry
The Government grants licences to private
sector companies to explore and exploit oil
and gas resources (see below). Its main
sources of revenue from oil and gas activities
are Petroleum Revenue Tax (see p. 161),
levied on all fields approved between 1975
and March 1993; Corporation Tax, charged
on the profits of oil and gas companies—the
only tax on profits of fields approved after
March 1993; and royalty, which applies only
to fields approved before April 1982 and is
paid at 12.5 per cent of the landed value of the
petroleum.
Licensing
Holders of government licences explore for
and produce oil and gas from specific offshore
or onshore areas. In addition to awarding
licences, the Government must approve all
proposed wells and field development plans.
Since 1964, 17 offshore licensing rounds have
been held, and by the end of 1996, 6,221 wells
had been, or were being, drilled in the UKCS:
1,950 exploration wells, 1,171 appraisal wells
and 3,100 development wells. The 275 blocks,
in 68 tranches, offered in the 17th round
covered more remote areas than hitherto, such
as the Rockall Trough and west of the
Hebrides, which have previously seen little
exploration or have been thought
unexptorable. Licences are subject to ^
conditions to p&tect other marine interests,
including care of the environment. ,
. 1 y
Production and Reserves
There were 173 offshore fields in production
at the end of March 1997—88 oil, 77 gas and 8 j -
condensate (a lighter form of oil). Production
started at 16 new offshore oilfields during
1996-97, and a total of 18 new development
projects were approved during 1996. Offshore, U
these comprised 13 oilfields and two gasfields;
onshore, two gas and one oil. In addition,
approval for 12 incremental offshore
developments (further developments to
existing fields) was granted.
-I _
260
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Schiehallion, 130 km (80 miles) west of
Shetland, discovered in 1993, is the second
field approved for development in the
Atlantic Margin of the UKCS. With
estimated potential recoverable reserves of
56.7 million tonnes, it is significantly
larger than the first, the nearby Foinaven
field, discovered in 1990, which is
expected to start production in 1997.
Cumulative UKCS oil production to date is
2,047 million tonnes. The fields with the
largest production totals are Forties, Brent,
Ninian and Piper. Britain’s largest onshore
oilfield, at Wytch Farm (Dorset), produces 90
per cent of the total crude oils and NGLs
originating onshore. Remaining recoverable
reserves of oil in the ‘proven’ plus ‘probable’
categories amount to 3,400 million tonnes,
while maximum possible remaining reserves
could be 2,025 million tonnes. In addition,
potential additional reserves range from 130 to
350 million tonnes and undiscovered
recoverable reserves are calculated at between
285 and 2,700 million tonnes.
Offshore Gas
Initial offshore exploration concentrated on
finding gas in the Southern Basin of the North
Sea. After the first commercial natural gas
discovery in the West Sole field in 1965 and
the start of its exploitation in 1967, supplies of
offshore natural gas grew rapidly, and by 1977
natural gas had replaced town gas in the public
supply system in Great Britain.
Natural gas now accounts for about 30 per
cent of total inland primary fuel consumption
in Britain. In 1996 indigenous production
amounted to 89,840 million cubic metres.
Production from the three most prolific
offshore gasfields, Leman, Indefatigable
(South) and the Hewett area, has accounted
for 43 per cent of the total gas produced so far
in the UKCS. Associated gas,4 delivered by
pipeline to land via the Far North Liquids
and Associated Gas System (FLAGS) and
from the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation
4Mainly methane, produced and used on oil production platforms.
System (SAGE), makes additional
contributions. The Southern Basin fields
and the South Morecambe field in the Irish
Sea produce more gas in winter to satisfy
increased demand, with the North Sean and
South Sean fields also augmenting supplies
to meet peak demand on very cold days in
winter. The partially depleted Rough field is
used as a gas store for rapid recovery during
peak winter periods.
Cumulative gas production to date is 1.14
million million cubic metres. Remaining
recoverable gas reserves already discovered
are estimated at between 760,000 million
and 1.96 million million cubic metres. If
possible gas from existing discoveries and
potential future discoveries are added, the
remaining total reserves are estimated to be
in the range of 1.29 million million to 3.8
million million cubic metres.
Pipelines
Some 8,500 km (5,312 miles) of major
submarine pipeline transport oil, gas and
condensate from one field to another and to
shore.
Five pipeline terminals on the North Sea
coast bring gas ashore to supply a national and
regional high- and low-pressure pipeline
system some 267,300 km (167,060 miles) long,
which transports natural gas around Great
Britain. A pipeline taking natural gas from
Scotland to Northern Ireland (40.4 km; 25
miles) carried its first gas in autumn 1996. The
pipeline under construction from Bacton to
Zeebrugge in Belgium will provide an
interconnector to link Britain’s and the EU gas
grids. Some Britain/Europe contracts have
already been signed—for example, Centrica
(see p. 265) is contracted to supply 3,000
million cubic metres over a seven-year period
to Thyssengas of Germany when the pipeline is
completed at the end of 1998. The gas pipeline
between Scotland and the Irish Republic was
finished in 1996.
Economic and Industrial Aspects
In 1996 UKCS oil and gas production
accounted for some 2.5 per cent of Britain’s
262
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
GDP. Total revenues from the sale of oil
(including NGLs) and gas produced from the
UKCS in 1996 are estimated at £ 12,600 million
and £5,300 million respectively. Taxes and
royalty receipts attributable to UKCS oil and
gas came to about £3,600 million in 1996-97,
compared with £2,350 million in 1995—96.
Since 1965, the oil and gas production
industry has generated trading profits of
some £191,000 million, of which nearly
£69,000 million has been reinvested in the
industry, £83,000 million paid in taxation,
and £39,000 million left for disposal by the
companies. Total income of the oil and gas
sector was £21,000 million in 1996.
Proceeds from the sale of oil in 1996 were
up 20 per cent on 1995; those from the sale
of gas were up 28 per cent. Total value of
oil and gas produced onshore was about
£490 million in 1996, compared with £440
million in 1995.
Gross capital investment from British
sources in the oil and gas extraction industry
rose by 3.5 per cent to £4,400 million in 1996.
This represented about 18 per cent of total
British industrial investment and 4 per cent of
gross domestic capital investment. Some
30,000 people were employed by the offshore
industry in September 1996, of whom 93 per
cent were British nationals. In addition, oil
and gas provide employment for about
331,000 people in support industries.
Decommissioning and the Environment
The Petroleum Act 1987 provides for the
decommissioning of redundant offshore oil
and gas installations and pipelines on the
UKCS. Owners have to submit proposals to
the Government for approval. The
Government is committed to ensuring that the
decommissioning programme for every
installation meets Britain’s international
obligations and represents the best practicable
environmental option (BPEO). It participates
in discussions within the framework of the
Oslo and Paris Commissions to consider
whether any changes may be necessary to the
regime applied to decommissioning in
northern European waters. The Brent Spar
storage and loading buoy remains moored in
Erfjord in Norway, while Shell considers
alternatives for its disposal. Any solution will
be judged against the BPEO for deep-sea
disposal.
In 1996 the total volume of UKCS oil
reported as spilt, at 127 tonnes, was at its
second lowest level since 1982, with no spill
over 20 tonnes; 92 per cent of reports were for
spills of less than 1 tonne.
Offshore Safety
Offshore health and safety are the
responsibility of the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE; see p. 185). Government
funding for the HSE’s Offshore Safety
Division reached £19 million in 1996—97.
Suppliers of Goods and Services
The Oil, gas and petrochemicals Supplies
Office (OSO) is the government arm ,
responsible for encouraging British
contractors and suppliers in the oil, gas and
petrochemicals industry to market their
capabilities worldwide. OSO also helps British
oil and gas companies develop contacts with
overseas governments. It also organises
briefing courses for British overseas missions
and has helped fund the British industry’s
Cost Reduction in the New Era initiative
(CRINE), relaunched in 1997 as CRINE
Network, which aims to make the British
offshore industry as competitive as any in the
world by 2000.
IEA forecasts attribute most of the recent
rise in North Sea output to new medium-size
fields coming on stream, a process made
possible by CRINE, which has cut more than
30 per cent from oil and gas project costs by
improving competitiveness.
Demand for floating production systems
has grown quickly and has provided contracts
for the offshore industry. Converted tankers
are used to exploit smaller oilfields, whose
development would not be viable with
traditional fixed platforms. An AMEC-led
consortium has secured a contract worth
£300 million to build the main processing
platform for the new Shell-operated
264
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Shearwater oilfield in the North Sea. Yards
at Wallsend (Tyne and Wear), Hartlepool
and Middlesbrough (Cleveland) have shares
in the work. Lewis Offshore at Stornoway
(Outer Hebrides) is among Scottish firms
working on platforms for the Elgin and
Franklin oilfields, both Elf projects.
DOWNSTREAM OIL
Oil Consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery consumption)
in 1996 included 22.4 million tonnes of petrol for
motors, 14.4 million tonnes of DERV (diesel-
engined road vehicles) fuel, 8 million tonnes of
aviation turbine fuel, 7.6 million tonnes of gas oil
(distilled from petroleum) and 6.9 million tonnes
of fuel oils (blends of heavy petroleum).
Oil Refineries
In 1996, Britain’s 15 refineries processed 96.7
million tonnes of crude and process oils, 4 per
cent up on 1995. About 80 per cent of output
by weight is in the form of lighter, higher-
value products, such as gasoline, DERV and
jet kerosine. Britain is much more geared
towards petrol production than its European
counterparts—about a third of the barrel of
crude, compared to a European average of just
over a fifth.
Trade
In 1996, Britain exported 23.7 million tonnes
of refined petroleum products, worth £2,735
million. Virtually all exports went to Britain’s
partners in the EU and the IEA, the largest
markets being France and Germany, and the
United States.
British exports of gas were 33 per cent
higher in 1996 than in 1995. Some 1,400
million cubic metres of UKCS gas were
exported, mainly to the Netherlands, from the
British share of the Markham transboundary
field. About 1,700 million cubic metres were
imported from Norway. Norwegian imports
were 2.1 per cent of total supplies in 1996,
compared with 2.5 per cent in 1995.
GAS SUPPLY INDUSTRY
Structure of the Industry
The original regime put in place by the Gas
Act 1986 envisaged that British Gas would
retain a monopoly of supply to tariff
customers (those taking less than 25,000
therms a year), while above this threshold, in
the contract market, new entrants would be
allowed to compete. This has been difficult to
enforce; and the Government eventually
instructed British Gas to separate its gas
supply and transportation activities. The Gas
Act 1995, which set the framework for a fully
competitive gas market, does not allow a
holder of a public gas transporter’s licence to
hold licences for supply or shipping.5 In
February 1997, British Gas demerged into two
entirely separate companies. The supply
business is now part of the holding company
Centrica pic, while the pipeline and storage
businesses, most exploration and production,
and R & D have been retained within British
Gas pic, renamed BG pic.
The national and regional gas pipeline
network is owned by Transco, part of BG pic.
A Network Code sets the legal and contractual
framework for the rights and responsibilities
of Transco and users of its transportation and
storage network.
Competition
During 1994-97, competition has developed
significantly, with some 70 suppliers having
captured about 70 per cent of the overall
industrial and commercial market (for
customers using more than 2,500 therms a
year). In the firm contract market (above 25,000
therms), 80 per cent of gas is now supplied by
independents; within the 2,500-25,000 therm
market, the comparable figure is 57 per cent;
and in the interruptible market,6 competitors to
5 Suppliers sell piped, gas to consumers; public gas transporters
(PGTs) operate the pipeline system through which such gas will
normally be delivered; shippers arrange with PGTs for
appropriate amounts of gas to go through the pipeline system.
‘Subject to a four-hour notice period Transco may interrupt
supplies to various customers, principally because of network
capacity constraints or high demand. The Network Code allows
Transco to make supply/demand interruptions when demand
exceeds 85 per cent of peak day demand.
265
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
British Gas Trading (Centrica’s supply
business) deliver some 65 per cent.
The opening of the domestic market in
south-west and south-east England, covering
some 2.2 million consumers, has involved 14
new supply companies, including several
regional electricity companies (for example,
SWEB, NOR WEB and Eastern Electricity),
and the oil companies Amerada Hess and
Total. By August 1997, 21 per cent of
consumers in both regions had switched from
British Gas to new suppliers. Gas market
competition was extended to northern England
and Scotland from November 1997, and will be
extended to the rest of England and Wales
during 1998.
Only companies which have been granted a
supplier’s licence are allowed to sell gas. The
licence carries various conditions, which
include providing gas to anyone in the licence
area who requests it and is connected to the
mains gas supply. Suppliers must offer
customers a range of payment options; they are
able to set their own charges, but have to
publish their prices and other terms so that
customers can make an informed choice. BG
Transco retains responsibility for dealing with
gas leaks and emergencies.
The Director General of Gas Supply, who
heads Ofgas, the industry regulator, has powers
to control gas prices and to set and enforce
standards of performance, and oversees the
development of competition.
Consumption
Gas consumption, at an estimated 943.6
terawatt7 hours (TWh) in 1996, was up 16 per
cent on 1995, with gas supplied for electricity
generation (amounting to 186.9 TWh) up 31
per cent. Sales to industry (191.3 TWh) were
10 per cent up on 1995; to the commercial
sector (122.3 TWh) 9 per cent up. Domestic
sales (375.8 TWh) were 15 per cent up. There
has been a steady fall in gas prices since 1982.
In 1995 they were the lowest among the
European G7 countries. Between 1986 and
1996 average industrial gas prices fell by 63
per cent in real terms; domestic prices were
71 TW = 1,000 gigawatts. 1 GW = 1,000 megawatts (MW). 1
MW = 1,000 kilowatts (kW).
reduced by 20 per cent (including VAT). In
Great Britain a typical household’s annual gas
bill fell in real terms from £400 in 1986 to
£320 in 1996.
COAL
The nationalised coal industry was privatised
in 1994. The main mining operators are RJB
Mining pic (in England and Wales); Mining
(Scotland) Ltd; Celtic Energy Ltd; and Tower
(a care-and-maintenance pit at Hirwaun in
Rhondda, Cynon and Taff, sold to a ‘buy-out’
team of former employees). RJB Mining and
Celtic Energy, together with the Scottish Coal
Company Ltd, are the main opencast
operators. At the end of 1996, there were 27
major deep mines in operation (with about
12,500 workers), which had been transferred
into private ownership from the nationalised
industry; another 34 (with about 4,800
workers), which were already in private
ownership; and 91 opencast sites. Opencast
accounts for most of the relatively low sulphur
coal mined in Scotland and south Wales,
which contributes towards improving the
quality and cost of English coal supplies.
Market for Coal
In 1996 inland consumption of coal was 7 per
cent down on the 1995 figure, at 71.4 million
tonnes, of which 76.9 per cent was used by the
electricity generators, 12.4 per cent by coke
ovens, 1.3 per cent by other fuel producers, 5
per cent by industry and 3.8 per cent by
domestic consumers. Exports were 988,000
tonnes, while imports amounted to 17.8
million tonnes—mainly of steam coal for
electricity generation and coking coal. Total
production from British deep mines fell from
35.1 million tonnes in 1995 to 32.2 million
tonnes in 1996. Total opencast output stayed
at about 16 million tonnes.
Although the British coal industry now has
the lowest production costs of any in the EU,
and is the only one not in receipt of a
government subsidy, it faces a number of
significant challenges: in particular, the expiry
of its contracts with the main electricity
generators in 1998, which is likely to lead to
266
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
increased use of cheaper imported coal; and
the constraints on coal use imposed by
tougher environmental standards, which
currently help to make gas firing the first
choice of most generators for new plant.
Coal Research
The DTI is involved in a collaborative clean
coal technology R & D programme, with
industry, universities and overseas
organisations. The programme has funded 240
projects with a total value of £250 million, of
which the DTI has contributed £50 million.
Coal Authority
The Coal Authority, which took over the
management of Britain’s unworked coal reserves
from British Coal in 1994, licenses coal-mining;
holds, manages and disposes of interests in
unworked coal and coal mines; provides
information about mining plans and geological
data; and deals with subsidence damage claims
arising from former coal-mining.
ELECTRICITY
England and Wales
There are 33 generating companies in England
and Wales, of which the principal ones are
National Power, PowerGen, Eastern Group,
British Energy, and Magnox Electric. They
sell electricity to suppliers through a
marketing mechanism known as the ‘Poof.
The National Grid (NGC) owns and operates
the transmission system, and is responsible for
calling up generation plant to meet demand.
To ensure a smooth transition to a
competitive market, the Government holds
special shares in National Power and
PowerGen, which limit individual
shareholdings to 15 per cent; it also holds a
special share in the NGC, which until its
flotation in 1995 was owned by the regional
electricity companies (RECs). Magnox pic
remains wholly publicly owned.
Distribution—transfer of electricity from
the national grid to consumers via local
networks—is carried out by the 12 RECs in
England and Wales. Supply covers the
purchase of electricity from generators and its
sale to customers. Until 1998, RECs have a
monopoly of all franchise sales (to consumers
taking 100 kWh a year or less) in their regions,
known as ‘first-tier’ supply. Above 100 kWh,
the market is already open to competition, and
consumers may have contracts with a ‘second-
tier’ supplier, who could be one of the
generators, an REC from a different region, or
an independent supplier. This market
accounted for almost half the electricity
supplied in Britain in 1996-97. Since the
expiry of the Government’s special shares in
the English and Welsh RECs in 1995, there
have been take-overs and mergers; ownership
of 11 of the 12 RECs has changed, with some
being bought by overseas companies,
especially from the United States. There has
also been a trend towards the creation of
multi-utilities, some of which, such as the
merger of NorthWest Water and NOR WEB,
provide the opportunity for creating common
services. British electricity companies are also
investing overseas. National Power, for
example, shares ownership in, and in some
cases maintains, power stations in Australia,
China, Pakistan, Portugal and the United
States; it has invested about £900 million in
7,500 MW of capacity.
Scotland
ScottishPower pic and Scottish Hydro-
Electric pic are vertically integrated companies
which generate, transmit, distribute and
supply electricity within their respective
franchise areas'. They are also contracted to
buy all the output from Scottish Nuclear Ltd,
now part of British Energy pic, until 2005.
There are about 5,500 customers in the
Scottish competitive market (comprising those
with a maximum demand of 100 kWh or
more), which accounts for about 40 per cent of
all electricity consumed. Only 9 per cent of
this market is met by second-tier suppliers,
mainly by Scottish companies securing
customers from each other’s area.

ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
electricity from four power stations. They are
obliged to sell it to Northern Ireland Electricity
(NIE), which has a monopoly of transmission
and distribution, and a right to supply. Supply
to all customers is open to competition, but the
small scale and isolation of the system has so far
made it difficult for competition to develop.
The largest power station, Ballylumford, has
been converted from oil to gas firing and
accounts for almost half Northern Ireland’s
generating capacity (2,243 MW). In 1996 the
Director General of Electricity Supply for
Northern Ireland (DGES)(NI) assumed
responsibility for the natural gas industry and a
new combined regulatory authority, OFREG
(Office for the Regulation of Electricity and
Gas), was established.
Associated Functions
Regulation of the industry in Great Britain is
primarily the responsibility of the Office of
Electricity Regulation, headed by the DGES,
whose duties include the promotion of
competition and protection of consumer
interests. The DGES is project co-ordinator
for full electricity market liberalisation in
Great Britain from 1998. The Electricity
Association is the principal trade association
for the electricity industry. It carries out
service and co-ordinating functions for the
major companies engaged in transmission,
distribution, supply and generation in
Britain. It has also a number of overseas
members. -
Consumption
In 1996 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in Britain amounted to
298.9 TWh. Domestic users took 36 per cent
of the total, industry 31 per cent, and
commercial and other Users the remainder.
Bitter winter weather pushed up electricity
demand in Britain—to a peak of 56.8 GW on
one day in January 1997. By comparison, the
maximum demand during August 1997 was
31.5 GW.
In 1995-96 the average industrial electricity
price was lower in real terms than for any year
since 1970. The average price for domestic
electricity in 1996 was 2.5 per cent lower than
in 1990. In 1996 an annual electricity bill for a
typical household in Britain was £297. British
domestic electricity prices in 1996 were the
third lowest within the G7 and the fourth
lowest within the EU.
Generation
The shares of generating capacity during
1995-97 are shown in Table 17.3.
Non-nuclear power stations owned by
Britain’s main power producers consumed
54.3 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1996,
of which coal accounted for 60 per cent,
natural gas 30 per cent and oil 6 per cent.
Other power producers (who mostly use gas),
and an increasing number of small
autogenerators (who produce power for their
own use), have equal access with the major
generators to the grid transmission and local
distribution systems.
Flue gas desulphurisation (FGD)
equipment, to control acid emissions, is fitted
at two of Britain’s largest coal-fired power
stations: Ratcliffe-on-Soar (Nottinghamshire)
and Drax (North Yorkshire). A ten-year
programme to control emissions of oxides of
nitrogen (NOx) through the installation of
low-NOx burners at 12 major power stations
in England and Wales is in progress.
ScottishPower has fitted low-NOx burners at
Longannet and Cockenzie.

a Electricity generated less electricity used at power stations (both.electricity used on works and that used for pumping at pumped-
storage stations).
Note: Differences between totals and the sums of their component parts are due to rounding.
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT)
In 1996, CCGT stations accounted for over 20
per cent of the electricity generated by major
power producers, compared with 8 per cent in
1993. This increase has been balanced by a fall
in coal- and oil-fired generation. Conversion
of two units at Didcot coal-fired power station
in Oxfordshire enables gas to be burned as an
alternative fuel.
CCGT technology continues to improve.
CCGT stations, using natural gas, offer cheap
generation, and give out almost no sulphur
dioxide and some 55 per cent less CO2 than
coal-fired plant per unit of electricity. In
England and Wales, 20 such stations (with a
total declared net capacity of 12.23 GW) are
generating electricity. About 2.2 GW of
CCGT capacity is under construction; there
are planning consents for a further 12 GW.
Between winter 1995-96 and spring 1997
National Power and PowerGen closed or
suspended 1.5 GW of oil-fired capacity.
Combined Heat and Power
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants are
designed to produce both electricity and
usable heat. They can be up to three times
more efficient than conventional electricity
generation, because they retain and utilise the
heat produced in the generating process,
rather than discarding it, as conventional
generation does. This also benefits the
environment by reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases. CHP is now also used for
cooling and chilling.
CHP can be fuelled by a variety of energy
sources. It offers particular benefits in
applications where there is a regular need for
heat as well as electricity—hospitals, leisure
centres, housing developments—and can be
provided on a local scale. During 1991—96 the
capacity of CHP plants in Britain rose by 54
per cent, and in 1996 CHP provided 3,560
MW, 5 per cent of all Britain’s electricity
generating capacity, on 1,330 sites; the
government target is 5,000 MW by the year
2000. CHP accounts for nearly 10 per cent of
electricity produced in the EU, while the
Netherlands, Denmark and Finland each use
CHP to generate over 30 per cent of their total
electricity needs.
Trade
The NGC and Electricite de France run a
2,000-MW cross-Channel cable link,
providing for transmission of electricity
between the two countries. The link has
270
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
generally been used to supply ‘baseload’
power—which needs to be generated and
available round the clock—from France to
England. Imports met about 0.6 per cent of
Britain’s electricity needs in 1996.
Scotland has a peak winter demand of
under 6 GW. It therefore has an over-capacity
(see p. 267) which is used to supply England
and Wales through transmission lines linking
the Scottish and English grid systems. This
interconnector’s capacity is now 1,870 MW,
with plans to increase it to 2,200 MW. NIE
and ScottishPower have signed an agreement
for a 60-km (37.5-mile) long 250 MW
undersea interconnector. Under the
agreement, ScottishPower has agreed to
supply NIE with electricity, at England and
Wales Pool-related prices, for at least 15 years
from the date of commissioning of the
interconnector.
Nuclear Power
Nuclear power in Britain is not at present
considered economically competitive with
fossil fuels, particularly gas, for new electricity
generation. However, nuclear power station
construction since the 1970s in many Western
countries has resulted in a stock of nuclear
capacity. Their output substantially reduces
the use of fossil fuels which would otherwise
be needed for generation—in Britain by
between 24 and 29 per cent in 1996. Such an
amount would cause emissions of up to 20.5
million tonnes of C02.
The privatised nuclear industry in Britain
consists of British Energy pic, and its two
subsidiaries: Nuclear Electric Ltd, which
operates the pressurised water reactor (PWR)
and five advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs)
in England and Wales; and Scottish Nuclear
Ltd, which operates the two AGRs in
Scotland. Nuclear Electric’s reactors have an
aggregate capacity of 7,200 MW and in
1996-97 an output of 49.4 TWh, equivalent to
about 17 per cent of current sales demand in
England and Wales. Scottish Nuclear operates
two AGR stations with an aggregate capacity
of about 2,400 MW and output of 17.6 TWh
in 1996, about 52 per cent of Scottish
electricity sales. In 1996—97, 46 per cent of
electricity generated in Scotland was produced
by these two stations. Scotland’s electricity
needs are also met from using hydro, coal and
gas resources, which have a total output
capacity of approximately 9,300 MW. Scottish
Nuclear sells 74.9 per cent of its output to
ScottishPower and the rest to Hydro-Electric.
The six Magnox power stations remaining
in public ownership are operated by Magnox
Electric pic, which is decommissioning three
more stations that have already closed. A
segregated fund was established on the
privatisation of British Energy, with a £228
million initial endowment from the nuclear
companies, to cover the eventual cost of
decommissioning its reactors. British Energy
is contributing £16 million a year.
That part of the fossil fuel levy (see p. 272)
attributable to British Energy ceased in 1996.
As a result, the levy rate fell from 10 to 2.2 per
cent in April 1997. It will continue to cover
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) and
renewables, and (for the present) some small
residual payments to Magnox Electric.
Separate arrangements apply in Scotland.
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
In 1996 the British nuclear industry achieved
record exports of £600 million, including over
£500 million of exports of nuclear fuel
products and services, mostly from BNFL.
BNFL is Britain’s primary provider of nuclear
fuel cycle services, from fuel manufacture and
transportation to recycling used nuclear fuel
and associated waste management and
decommissioning. The HSE’s Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate (Nil) recently
granted a ‘consent to operate’ at the thermal
oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) at Sellafield
(Cumbria). THORP already has advance
reprocessing orders worth £12,000 million,
two-thirds of which come from overseas. The
Sellafield Mixed Oxide Fuel plant, due to
become operational in 1998, has been designed
to fabricate mixed oxide fuel with depleted,
natural or recycled uranium and plutonium,
recovered from used nuclear fuel reprocessed in
THORP. A subsidiary company, BNFL Inc.,
has won contracts with United States
Department of the Environment sites and
commercial clients for the cleaning and
recycling of contaminated metals for re-use.

United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
UKAEA’s main function is to maintain and
decommission safely and cost-effectively its
redundant nuclear facilities used for Britain’s
nuclear R & D programme. UKAEA owns the
sites at Dounreay (Caithness), Culham and
Harwell (Oxfordshire), Windscale (Cumbria)
and Winfrith (Dorset), and is also responsible
for Britain’s fusion programme (see below).
AEA Technology
AEA Technology pic was that part of the
UKAEA which provided commercial science
and engineering services to the worldwide
nuclear industry and to the oil and gas,
transport and pharmaceutical industries; it
also provides environmental services. It was
privatised in 1996.
Nuclear Research
Nuclear fusion in Britain is funded by the
DTI and Euratom (75 per cent and 25 per
cent respectively). The Government plans to
spend £14.6 million in 1997-98 on fusion
research, of which the main focus is magnetic
confinement, based at Culham, where
Britain’s own nuclear fusion research is
carried out. However, Britain is also a partner
in the experimental EU JET (Joint European
Torus) project, also at Culham. The EU has
agreed to extend JET to the end of 1999. As a
follow-up to JET, the experimental ITER
(International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor) has entered its detailed project phase;
the objective is to show the scientific and
technological feasibility of power production
from fusion energy for peaceful purposes.
Nuclear Safety
Responsibility for ensuring the safety of
nuclear installations falls to nuclear operators
and is assured through a system of regulatory
control enforced by the nuclear industry’s
independent regulator, the Nil.
The international Convention on Nuclear
Safety came into force in October 1996. So
far, 42 countries, including Britain, have
ratified it. Before April 1999, each country
will produce a national report describing the
progress it has made in meeting the nuclear
safety obligations set out in the Convention.
Britain’s main contribution to the
international effort to improve safety in
Central and Eastern Europe and in the former
Soviet Union is channelled through the EU
PHARE and TACIS nuclear safety
programmes. An agreement between the G7
countries and Ukraine on the closure of the
Chernobyl nuclear plant by 2000 involves
some US $500 million in grants and US
$1,800 million in projected investments by
international financial institutions, including
2,400 million ECUs in loans from Euratom—
which co-ordinates and develops the EU’s
nuclear industries.
NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF
ENERGY
Renewables help to provide greater security
and diversity of supply, using indigenous
resources. They are also relatively benign
environmentally: wind, for example, produces
no emissions, although turbines can be
visually and aurally intrusive.
New and renewable sources, which include
biofuels, large- and small-scale hydro, wind
power and solar power, accounted for 2 per
cent of all electricity generating capacity in
Britain in 1996; natural flow hydro schemes
provided about three-quarters of this total.
Capacity for renewables generation other than
hydro is four times the level in 1990.
However, renewables provided only about
1.25 per cent of the electricity available in
Britain in 1996. The Government is reviewing
renewables to assess the feasibility of
producing 10 per cent of Britain’s electricity
demand from renewable sources by 2010.
The EU view on energy supply is that a
doubling of its renewables share by 2010 (from
the current 6 to 12 per cent) could be an
ambitious but realistic objective.
The non-fossil fuel obligation (NFFO)
requires each public electricity supplier (PES)
to reserve some capacity for a certain amount
of electricity to be generated from non-fossil
sources. PESs must then buy renewables-
sourced power at a premium price, above the
market price for conventionally generated

all electricity consumers through their bills;
some £94 million was paid in 1995-96 under
the NFFO arrangements for renewables. (In
Scotland the term Scottish Renewables
Obligation is used.)
Four Renewables Orders have been made
for England and Wales and two each for
Scotland and Northern Ireland. At the end of

successes include: European Gas
Turbines—sale of more than £2 million-
worth of 5 MW turbines for biomass
gasification in Sweden; Aerolaminates—
more than £7 million of orders for wind
turbine blades; and Thermomax—more
than £250,000 for solar heating
components for Singapore airport.
The British wind industry employs
about 1,300 people. The largest single
wind farm in Europe, at Carno (Powys),
opened in 1996. Developed by National
Wind Power Ltd at a cost of £26 million,
its 56 600 kW turbines will generate up to
33 MW, enough to meet the average
electricity needs of 25,000 homes.
Britain’s first community-owned wind
turbine has been commissioned as part of
the Harlock Hill wind cluster in Cumbria.
About 650 small investors, belonging to
BayWind co-operative, raised the
£620,000 needed to buy the turbine.

Exploration and Development
An exploration programme was started in
autumn 1996 in the Crediton Trough in
Devon, where the British Geological Survey’s
Mineral Reconnaissance Programme has
indicated the presence of gold. Exploration for
gold and development of mines continues in
Northern Ireland, at the Cavanacaw openpit,
and at the Cononish underground mine in
Scotland. It was announced in August 1997
that the South Crofty tin mine in Cornwall,
the only remaining tin mine in Britain, is to
close, thus bringing to an end 2,500 years of
tin production in Britain. The Boulby potash
mine in north-east England is Britain’s most
important non-energy mineral operation. In
1997 the mine obtained planning permission
to extend underground mining operations;
together with offshore reserves this will
further the life of the mine by some 25 years.

and river intakes; and about 25 per cent from
water stored underground. Summer 1995 to
spring 1997 in England and Wales was the
driest two-year period for over 200 years.
Some 360 mm less rain fell than normal,
equivalent to four months’ winter rainfall.
Prolonged drought threatens rivers, streams,
wetlands and wildlife. Underground water
levels, stored in layers of porous rock, are at a
record low in many places. Of 33 major rivers
in England, only one is not at risk, with some
less than a third of average depth. The
Environment Agency, which is responsible
for protecting water resources, has warned
that increasingly dry weather may become
long-term as a result of climate change. Heavy
rain in June 1997 did not alleviate the drought
because summer rain either evaporates or is
taken by vegetation before it can replenish
water underground, although it reduces the
demand for garden sprinklers. Leakage in
supply pipes is a serious problem.
By contrast, Scotland has a relative
abundance of unpolluted water from upland
sources and is in a position to export it.
Northern Ireland also has plentiful supplies
for domestic use and for industry.
Water put into the public supply system
(including industrial and other uses) in
England and Wales averaged 17,571 <
megalitres (Ml) a day in 1995—96, of which
average domestic daily consumption per
household was about 178.5 litres. An average
of 2,322 Ml a day was supplied in Scotland in |
1995-96. In Northern Ireland the figure was i |
703 Ml a day.
Some 55,970 Ml a day were abstracted in
England and Wales in 1995, of which public
water supplies accounted for 17,346 Ml a day. i ^
The electricity supply industry took 25,805
Ml a day; fish farming, cress growing and
amenity ponds 4,268 Ml a day; and
agriculture 103 Ml a day, with spray irrigation
accounting for a further 352 Ml a day.
Fluoridation of water supplies began in the
early 1960s after trials which showed
improvement in the condition of children’s
teeth. The Water Industry Act 1991 and the i
Water (Fluoridation) Act 1985 empower
water undertakers in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland, and the water authorities in
Scotland, to implement a fluoridation scheme
at the request of a health authority or board.
Before submitting their proposals, the health
authority or board must engage in a publicity
and consultation process. Those that do add
fluoride have to ensure that the concentration
is maintained at 1 milligram of fluoride for
every litre supplied. There are no current
fluoridation schemes in Scotland.
England and Wales
To prevent future shortages, to get across its
view that water is a precious resource and to
encourage the public to save it, the
Government announced a ten-point plan in
May 1997, which the water companies have
agreed to follow:
• the Director of Water Services to set
mandatory targets for total leakage and t(
enforce a substantial reduction in leakage
over the next five years;
• provision of free leakage detection and
repair service for customer-owned (
household supply pipes;
• water companies to be under a statutory
duty to conserve water in carrying out
their functions;
276
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
• water companies to promote efficient use
of water by customers, for example, by
water-saving fittings and appliances, free
water-efficiency audits and water-
efficient gardening;
• consideration for the role which the
Government’s Environmental Task
Force can play in improving efficiency of
water use;
• new water regulations to include
significantly tighter requirements for
water efficiency; and promotion of water
efficiency in industry and agriculture,
including use of best practice
programmes;
• review of water charging system and
metering policy (see below);
• all water companies which have not already
done so to agree with the Director General
of Water Services amendments to their
licences already accepted by other
companies, requiring compensation
payments to customers affected by
drought-related restrictions; compensation
payments also recommended to customers
who have been exposed to potentially
harmful contamination;
• publication at local level of clear details of
performance in meeting targets for leakage
reduction, water supply and drinking
water quality, together with information
on investment in the water service and
resulting benefits to the environment; and
t the Government to review the water
abstraction licensing system and
arrangements for bulk transfer of
water—to ensure that the environment
is given due weight in decisions on use
of water; and each water company to
agree a detailed, publicly available
drought contingency plan with the
Environment Agency.
The Director General of Water Services,
who heads the industry’s regulatory body,
Ofwat, is to set each water company
mandatory leakage targets for 1998-99 and
intends to set them annually. The current
targets involve a reduction of leakages by 680
Mia day and maximum wastage of between 10
and 15 per cent.
Water Companies
Ten water and sewerage companies in
England and Wales have statutory
responsibilities for water supply, its quality
and sufficiency, and for sewerage and sewage
treatment. The supply-only companies, of
which there were 29 in the private sector in
1989, now, after various mergers, number 18.
They supply water to nearly a quarter of the
population.
In June 1997 the Government launched a
review of the water-charging system. It is
looking at charges for both measured and
unmeasured systems, the future use of the old
rateable value of a property (a system
abolished in 1991) to determine charges in the
latter, and debt recovery arrangements. After
31 March 2000 companies must not base their
charges on rateable values. Over 75 per cent of
commercial and industrial customers pay for
water and sewerage services on the basis of
their metered consumption. Twelve
companies install domestic meters without
cost to the consumer; it is estimated that one
in ten households will have a meter by the end
of 1997. The Government, however, while in
favour of selective metering to cover large and
more affluent households, opposes
compulsory metering for essential household
use and considers that no one should be
deprived of water because of inability to pay
for it.
Of the nearly 3 million tests of drinking
water carried out by water companies in 1996,
99.7 per cent complied with both EU and
national water quality standards (compared
with 99.5 per cent in 1995). The Drinking
Water Inspectorate of the DETR, which
checks that the companies supply wholesome
water, carried out inspections to ensure that
they complied with the Water Quality
Regulations.
Ensuring Supplies
Water company investment for 1996-97 has
increased by 16 per cent, largely in the repair
of leakages. The industry is under growing
pressure to try innovative techniques to
increase supplies while reducing bills. All the
companies offer a free leak-repair service for
277
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The water supply companies in England
and Wales provide almost 4.6 million
households with water—about 11 million
people. All water supplied to homes is
treated to drinking water standards: 1 per
cent of total water provided by the
companies is used for drinking; 2 per cent
for cooking; 49 per cent for the bathroom;
3 per cent is used in the garden. Demand
for water is rising by about 2 per cent a
year. A bath costs approximately 4.5
pence; a shower 2 pence; and a glass of
water 0.02 pence. Total turnover of the 18
water supply companies is about £620
million a year.
A garden sprinkler uses the same
amount of water in an hour as a typical
family of four uses in two days.
customers’ supply pipes. Some have adopted
water-saving measures, which include free
plumbing help in fitting devices to cisterns,
checking overflow efficiency and replacing
faulty washers.
Anglian Water, with the lowest rainfall
rates in England (600 mm a year on average),
has a low leakage rate, which it expects to cut
to less than 10 per cent by 2000. It is replacing
its Victorian lead pipework with polyethylene.
Thames Water, with a leakage rate of 38.6 per
cent in 1997, has been ordered by Ofwat to
produce quarterly leakage returns. Wessex
Water, the smallest of the water and sewerage
companies, is to test a technique which
involves pumping surplus water into a natural
underground reservoir for recovery at times of
need. This scheme could supply the company,
which produces 434 Ml a day, with an
additional 20 Ml a day. Companies in
southern and eastern England are considering
desalination projects, even though such
schemes have hitherto been thought
uneconomic. The Folkestone and Dover
company (Kent), which has some of the most
serious shortages in Britain, has found that
metering reduces consumption by 10 per cent,
and by 15-20 per cent at peak times. A report
for the Drinking Water Inspectorate in 1997
says that there is no reason why greater use
should not be made of greywater (recycled
from wash basins, showers and baths) to flush
lavatories and thus cut domestic consumption
by up to a third.
The statutory duties and powers of the
Environment Agency include regulation of the
water environment. Its responsibilities extend
to all rivers, lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, coastal
waters and groundwater. Its consent is needed
for the abstraction of water and the discharge
of effluent.
Scotland
Since 1996, responsibility for the provision of
all water and sewerage services has rested with
three public water authorities—the North,
West and East of Scotland Water Authorities.
The Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers
Council protects and represents all their
customers. It also approves the water
authorities’ charging schemes and codes of
practice, and is financed by an annual levy on
the authorities.
Charges for water supply depend on the
type of consumer: domestic consumers pay
water charges based on their council tax band
(see p. 167) or metered charges, and non¬
domestic consumers pay non-domestic water
rates, or metered charges. For sewerage
services, domestic consumers pay a sewerage
charge based on their council tax band, and
non-domestic consumers pay non-domestic
sewerage rates, and, where appropriate, trade
effluent charges for the licensed discharge of
industrial wastewater. Charges and rates are
decided by each water authority and must be
approved by the Customers Council. Local
authority funding is available to reduce the
charges set for domestic sewerage.
The Government is committed to
returning the Scottish water industry to local
democratic control. A review is in progress.
The Scottish Environment Protection
Agency has statutory responsibility for water
pollution control.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for public
water supply and sewerage throughout
278
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Northern Ireland. It is also responsible for the
conservation and cleanliness of water
resources and, with the Department of
Agriculture, prepares, if necessary, water
management programmes for any area. A
domestic water charge is contained in local
rates, while agriculture, commerce and
industry pay metered charges.
Overseas Contracts
British water companies are winning
contracts to upgrade and manage
distribution and sewerage networks overseas.
Anglian Water, for example, has been
instrumental in helping to reduce shortages
in Buenos Aires. Thames Water is in a
partnership to manage supplies in Adelaide.
It is also the major partner in a group which
has signed a 25-year agreement, with capital
investment of about £160 million in the first
five years, to manage and improve the water
supply to half the city of Jakarta. North West
Water and Severn Trent have been \yorking
since 1994 on reforming the water-supply
system in Mexico City: making a census,
installing meters, creating an infrastructure
for paying bills, repairing pipes and reducing
leakages. In 1996, Severn Trent started work
on a World Bank-sponsored management
contract (initially for three to five years) for
the water and wastewater system in Trinidad
and Tobago.

The BSE crisis dominated British agriculture in 1996 and 1997. The Government’s
top priority was to protect public and animal health. Measures were also taken to
help the industry adjust and to restore consumer confidence. The Government’s
next priority is the lifting of the EU worldwide ban on the export of British beef
and beef products. Because of the BSE crisis, home-fed production of beef for
human consumption fell by 29 per cent between 1995 and 1996, as the carcasses of
about 1.4 million cattle (in the year from May 1996 to May 1997) and over 570,000
calves (in the year from April 1996 to April 1997) were removed from the food
chain. The Government is committed to establishing an independent Food
Standards Agency—to promote the safety and quality of food throughout the
chain from production to consumption. Britain has secured agreement among EU
members to pay full regard to animal welfare in developing policies on
agriculture, transport, the internal market and research.
Some £36.4 million has been spent on decommissioning fishing boats during
1993-96 to meet Britain’s fishing fleet reduction targets.
In 1996 British agriculture employed 2 per
cent (529,000 people) of the total workforce.
The agricultural contribution to GDP was
£8,888 million in 1996,1.4 per cent of the total.
Food, feed and beverages accounted for 9.6 per
cent of Britain’s imports by value. Self-
sufficiency in food and feed fell in 1996: from
58.4 to 53.4 per cent of all food and feed, and
from 75.1 to 69.4 per cent of indigenous-type
food and feed. This was mainly owing to lower
levels of both output and exports of beef, and
higher levels of imports of meat and meat
preparations other than beef. Britain is a major
agricultural exporter of livestock, food products,
agrochemicals and agricultural machinery.
Agriculture
Agriculture plays a key role in European
Union (EU) policy. It accounts for the largest
proportion of EU legislation and about half of
expenditure under the budget. Modernisation
of farming within the EU has reduced the
proportion of the labour force working in
agriculture from almost 20 per cent in the
early 1960s to about 5 per cent today.
Agriculture accounts for less than 2 per cent
of EU gross domestic product (GDP). The
share of both agricultural imports and exports
as a proportion of total EU trade is about
11 per cent.

The Government’s pre-election manifesto
identified the special needs of people who live
and work in rural areas. The Government
supports the principle of sustainable
development for the countryside and
recognises the need for a prosperous rural
economy with protection for the environment.
Land Use
In 1996, 11.4 million hectares (28.2 million
acres) were under crops and grass. A further 5.7
million hectares (14 million acres) were used for
rough grazing, most of it in hilly areas. Soils
vary from the thin poor ones of highland Britain
to the rich fertile soils of low-lying areas, such as
the fenlands of eastern England. The climate is
generally temperate, though rainfall distribution
over Britain is uneven. The South East receives
only about 600 mm (24 inches) a year, compared
with over 1,500 mm (59 inches) in parts of west
Scotland, Cumbria and Wales.
Farming
In 1996 there were some 234,300 farm
holdings in Britain (excluding minor holdings
too small to be surveyed on a regular basis),
with an average area of 72.6 hectares (179.4
acres), again excluding minor holdings. About
two-thirds of all agricultural land is owner-
occupied. Some 44 per cent of holdings are
smaller than 8 European size units (ESU).'

cent during 1985-96. Total income from
farming (that of farmers, partners, directors
and their spouses, and family workers, see
Table 18.1) was estimated at £4,889 million in
1996, 5.4 per cent less (at current prices) than
in 1995. In real terms this measure of income is
about 38 per cent more than the average for
1984-86. High world prices for some basic
commodities, including cereals, and the
increasing value of EU payments to farmers in
respect of, for example, setting land aside have
contributed to this growth.
1 ESUs measure the financial potential of the holding in terms of
the margins which might be expected from stock and crops: 8
ESU is judged the minimum for full-time holdings.

At the end of 1995 the industry’s gross
capital stock, valued at 1990 prices, amounted
to £33,480 million, of which buildings and
works made up just under two-thirds. The
level of capital stock is now estimated to be 1
per cent below the 1985-87 average.
PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 18.2 as a percentage by weight
of total supplies. Total new supply is home
production plus imports less exports.
Livestock
Over half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairy farming or to beef cattle and
sheep. Most of the animals are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland and northern and south¬
western England. Among world-famous
British livestock are the Hereford and
Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the Jersey,
Guernsey and Ayrshire dairy breeds, Large
White pigs and a number of sheep breeds.
Livestock totals are given in Table 18.3.

b For human consumption only; does not include eggs for hatching,
n.a.: not available.
Cattle and Sheep
Cattle and sheep constitute about 37 per cent
of the value of Britain’s gross agricultural
output. Dairy production is the largest part of
the sector, followed by cattle and calves, and
then fat sheep and lambs. Most dairy cattle in
Britain are bred by artificial insemination. In
1996 the average size of dairy herds was 67
(excluding minor holdings), while the average
yield of milk for each dairy cow was 5,570
litres (1,225 gallons). Average household
consumption of liquid (including low-fat) milk
per head in 1996 was 1,848 millilitres (3.25
pints) a week.
More than half of home-fed beef
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Holstein Friesian breed
predominates. The remainder derives from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves, mostly in the hills and uplands. The
traditional British beef breeds (see above) and,
increasingly, imported breeds such as
Charolais, Limousin, Simmental and Belgian
Blue, are used for beef production. The size of
the beef-breeding herd expanded by 37 per
cent during 1987-96, while the dairy herd
decreased by 17 per cent.
In spring 1996 the announcement of a
possible link between Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans
led to a significant loss of consumer
confidence in British beef. Clean cattle (beef
283
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
animals bred for human consumption) prices fell
considerably during the spring and early
summer, but partially recovered later in the year.
Average consumption for 1996 was 15—20 per
cent below the 1995 level and average clean
cattle prices were 14 per cent below the 1995
levels. Government aid for beef producers was
worth over £265 million in 1996—97 (see p. 290).
Britain has more than 60 native sheep
breeds and many cross-bred varieties. The size
of the British breeding flock remained almost
unchanged in 1996, though production of
sheepmeat was an estimated 7 per cent lower*
reflecting a general EU trend. The average
realised return for sheepmeat in Britain was
about 20 per cent higher than in 1995. This
can be attributed to a consumer switch from
beef as a result of the BSE crisis.
The Integrated Administration and Control
System (IACS), an EU-wide anti-fraud
measure, requires farmers to submit an annual
application giving field-by-field details of their
farmed land. This serves as a basis for
administrative and on-farm checks on their
entitlement to aid under area-based Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) schemes. The IACS
includes systems for uniquely identifying
farmers’ fields and animals. Details of farmers’
IACS applications and the results of checks are
stored in a computerised database.
Pigs
Pig production is particularly important in
East Anglia and Yorkshire. About 22 per cent
of holdings with breeding sows account for 83
per cent of the national breeding herd, which
comprises some 744,000 sows. Britain exports
to such destinations as Germany, Italy,
France, Japan and Korea. However, bacon is
imported from Denmark, the Netherlands and
the Irish Republic. British companies supply
about 8 per cent of the genetically improved
pigs and sows bought by the world’s pig
farmers.
Poultry
The total bird population in 1996 was about
131 million: 76.6 million chickens and other
table fowls; 32 million birds in the laying
flock; 7.5 million fowls for breeding; 12.5
million turkeys (England and Wales only); 2.5
million ducks; and 142,000 geese.
Poultry production in 1996 was 1.45
million tonnes, a 4 per cent increase on 1995.
Broiler production, at 1.08 million tonnes, was
58,000 tonnes above the level for 1995.
Broilers from the 9 per cent of holdings with
over 100,000 table birds account for well over
half of the total flock. Hen egg production, for
all uses, went up from 887 million dozen in
1995 to 889 million dozen in 1996.
Animal Welfare
Animal welfare continues to attract high levels
of public.interest. A comprehensive
framework of legislation, supported by codes
of practice, lays down standards that must
apply on the farm, during transport, at
markets and at slaughter.
At EU level Britain secured agreement at
the Amsterdam intergovernmental conference
in 1997 to a protocol to the Treaty of Rome.
This recognises that animals are sentient
beings and places on EU institutions a formal
obligation to pay full regard to animal welfare
when developing policies on agriculture,
transport, the internal market and research.
Britain was a prime mover in achieving an
EU-wide ban on close confinement veal crates
(prohibited in Britain since 1990) from 2006.
Britain also pressed the European Commission
to complete its overdue review of the directive
on the welfare of laying hens. Review of the
directive on the welfare of pigs is also in hand.
The Government is keen to ensure that
welfare requirements are properly enforced.
During 1997 it ordered a major review of
enforcement procedures relating to the welfare
of live animal exports. New rules for Great
Britain, implementing EU legislation on the
welfare of animals in transport, came into force
in 1997. They set down the maximum journey
and rest times for different species. Under
them, ministers have powers to disqualify
transporters who persistently break welfare
regulations. All staff working in long-distance
transport must have demonstrated their
competence in handling animals during transit.
Britain has led efforts to ensure that the highest
possible welfare standards are applied to the
transport of live animals within the EU.

In 1996 the Farm Animal Welfare Council
published advice on the welfare of pigs kept
out of doors, of farmed fish and of laying hens.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in eastern and central-
southern England and eastern Scotland. The
main crops are shown in Table 18.4. In Britain
in 1996 the area planted to cereals totalled 3.4
million hectares (8.4 million acres), an increase
of 6 per cent on 1995, largely as a result of a
further reduction in the set-aside rate (see p.
289), with a 9 per cent rise in output. Higher
market prices in the first half of 1996
contributed to an increase in the overall value
of output of 4 per cent (£121 million).
Large-scale potato and vegetable
cultivation takes place on the fertile soils
throughout Britain, often with irrigation.
Principal areas are the peat and[ silt fens of
Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk;
the sandy loams of Norfolk, Suffolk, West
Midlands, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire; the peat soils of South
Lancashire; and the alluvial silts by the river
Humber. Early potatoes are produced in
Shropshire, Pembrokeshire, Cornwall, Devon,
Essex, Suffolk, Kent, Cheshire and south-west
Scotland. Production of high-grade seed
potatoes is confined to Scotland, Northern
Ireland and the Welsh borders.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet
provides about 50 per cent of home needs,
most of the remainder being refined from raw
285
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
cane sugar imported under the Lome
Convention (see p. 207).
Horticulture
In 1996 the land utilised for horticulture
(excluding potatoes and peas for harvesting
dry) was about 189,000 hectares (467,000
acres). Vegetables grown in the open accounted
for 70 per cent of this, orchards for 15 per cent,
soft fruit for 6 per cent and ornamentals
(including hardy nursery stock, bulbs and
flowers grown in the open) for 7 per cent. More
than one vegetable crop may be taken from the
same area of land in a year, so that the
estimated area actually cropped for horticulture
in 1996 was 237,700 hectares (587,400 acres).
Mushrooms, carrots and lettuces are the
single most valuable horticultural crops, with
farm gate values of £166 million, £117 million
and £92 million respectively in 1996.
Field vegetables account for 55 per cent of
the value of horticultural output and are widely
grown throughout the country. Some are raised
in blocks of compressed peat or loose-filled
cells, a technique which reduces root damage
and allows plants to establish themselves more
reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing tomatoes,
cucumbers, sweet peppers, lettuces, flowers,
pot plants and nursery stock. Widespread use is
made of automatic control of heating and
ventilation, and semi-automatic control of
watering. Low-cost plastic tunnels extend the
season for certain crops previously grown in the
open.
Modifications to the EU regime for fresh
fruit and vegetables have enabled British
growers to apply for about £20 million of EU
funding for 1997-98, to help them to adapt
production more effectively to meet the needs
of the market; to improve product quality,
handling, marketing and value; and to
encourage environmentally sound practice and
waste management techniques. Similar recent
changes in the EU flowers and plants regime
provide about £675,000 of promotional
funding to be spent in Britain.
Alternative Crops
The Alternative Crops Unit of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF),
spending just over £1 million on R & D in
1997-98, encourages development of
alternative crops where they promise to
become economically viable. These include
short-rotation coppice for renewable energy,
oilseeds for industry, flax and hemp for paper,
automotive and other uses, and speciality
crops such as evening primrose for
pharmaceuticals.
FOOD SAFETY
EU food law harmonisation covers food safety,
fair trading and informative labelling. For
example, a beef-labelling scheme was agreed
in March 1997, to provide information on
fresh and frozen beef (including mince) which
may be confirmed through improved
traceability systems.
Britain identifies food safety risks through
food surveys, investigations and research, the
results of which are published. Food law
enforcement falls mainly to local authorities.
Expert independent advisory committees,
such as the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee, the Advisory
Committee on the Microbiological Safety of
Food and the Food Advisory Committee,
provide systematic assessments of risk.
The Government is committed to ensuring
the highest standards of meat hygiene in
Britain’s abattoirs and is determined that the
interests of the consumer should come first.
The Meat Hygiene Service, an executive
agency of MAFF with responsibility for meat
inspection in licensed plants, is pursuing
initiatives to improve hygiene, together with
the State Veterinary Service (SYS).
Following the concern about BSE (see p.
283), government measures to eliminate any
danger from potentially infected material
included the prohibition of all cattle over 30
months old from entering the human food
chain and stringent controls on
slaughterhouses, especially those on the
handling and disposal of specified bovine
materials (SBMs). These are the parts of the
carcass which are considered likely to be BSE
infective. The SBM Order 1997 further
tightened controls and introduced provisions
to cover cosmetic, pharmaceutical and medical
products.
286
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY & FORESTRY
In its campaign to promote consumer
confidence, the Government plans to
transfer primary responsibility for food
safety from MAFF to an independent
Food Standards Agency. A White Paper
and legislation are to set guidelines as soon
as possible. Among the Agency’s priorities
would be the safety of meat from the farm
to the abattoir, the butcher and the plate.
The EU Novel Foods regulation, which
stipulates approval for all such foods before
they are marketed, came into effect in May
1997. It contains labelling provisions,
including one to label foods if they contain
genetically modified organisms, which apply
also to existing EU food labelling legislation.
EXPORTS
Provisional data for 1996 suggest that the
value of exports related to agriculture (food,
feed and drink), at £10,100 million, was 1 per
cent up on 1995. The main markets in 1996
were France (£1,500 million—down 4 per
cent), the Irish Republic (£1,110 million—up
10 per cent), Germany (£760 million-—up 10
per cent) and Spain (£630 million—down 12
per cent). Severely curtailed beef exports
aside, the French market showed a 12 per cent
increase on 1995. Other key markets were the
United States (£630 million) and Japan (£270
million).
Cereals (both unmilled and processed) and
cereal dried products are the largest category
of British food exports, worth £1,600 million
in 1996. Exports also include specialities such
as dairy products, fresh salmon, biscuits, cakes
and pastries, jams and conserves, soft drinks,
and tea, coffee, cocoa and chocolate. Animal
feed is also significant, exports rising from
£380 million in 1995 to £400 million in 1996.
In March 1996 the EU imposed an
immediate worldwide ban on all British beef
and beef products (but not milk and milk
derivatives). As a result, worldwide exports of
beef fell by 77 per cent and the value of such
exports fell from £590 million in 1995 to £140
million in 1996.
Export promotion for food and drink is
headed by Food from Britain, an organisation
Exports of Scotch whisky in 1996 were
steady, at £2,300 million. Those of beer, at
£240 million, were up £66 million
worldwide. There was a 14 per cent
increase in ice cream sales abroad, from
£44 million in 1995 to £50 million in 1996.
An export record for unmilled wheat saw a
rise of 29 per cent (worth £100 million) to
about 3.9 million tonnes worldwide. The
20 per cent growth in the exports of cereals
and cereal dried products represented a
£270 million increase on 1995.
funded by MAFF (£5.3 million in 1996-97)
and industry (£6.2 million). For all other
agricultural products, services, machinery,
and processing equipment, MAFF co¬
ordinates export promotion, participates in
trade fairs and arranges ministerial visits to
other countries. Its presence at overseas trade
fairs during 1996 attracted over 850 serious
enquiries for British agricultural products.
Exports of agricultural machinery and
equipment in 1996 were worth £1,300
million.
The annual Royal Agricultural Show, held
(early July) at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire,
enables visitors to see the latest techniques
and improvements in British agriculture.
Some 175,000 visitors attended in 1997, of
whom 10 per cent were from overseas. Other
major agricultural events include the Royal
Smithfield Show, held every other year in
London, which exhibits agricultural
machinery, livestock and carcasses; the Royal
Highland Show (June) in Edinburgh; the
Royal Welsh Show (late July) in Builth Wells;
and the Royal Ulster Agricultural Show in
Belfast.
The Horticultural Export Bureau (HEB)
was created in 1996 with the support of
government funds to seek and develop export
opportunities for fresh produce from Great
Britain. Backed, through subscriptions, by
most of the major marketing organisations,
the HEB provides its members with market
information and general export advice;
develops contacts with international buyers
and conveys their needs to members; and
undertakes international promotion of the
industry.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
MARKETING
The Marketing Development Scheme (MDS)
encourages the agri-food industry to develop
and implement new marketing initiatives. In
1996, 87 awards worth some £4.2 million
were made in England; 14, worth £1.1
million, in Scotland; 22, worth about
£590,000, in Wales; and 14, worth some
£670,000, in Northern Ireland. The scheme
closed in England in 1996 (though it remains
open in the rest of Britain), to be replaced by a
new inter-departmental initiative
administered by the Department of Trade and
Industry. The DTPs Sector Challenge
provides a single source of funds for
competitive ventures from various sectors of
the economy. In the first round of the
Challenge, 28 projects from the agri-food
industries secured grants worth around £5.7
million over three years. These cover such
topics as developing business skills,
technology transfer and export promotion.
The Government is conducting a public
consultation on the experience of the first
round of the Challenge, the conclusions from
which will inform a decision on the future of
the scheme. It is also contributing £4.5
million over three years, through the MDS,
towards a campaign to restore confidence in,
and rebuild markets for, the Scottish beef
industry. The Government spent some £13
million in 1996-97 on research in support of
the competitiveness of the horticultural
industry.
Deregulation of milk and potato marketing
in Britain in 1996-97 has accorded with
government wishes to remove unnecessary
burdens which impede business, inhibit
innovation and damage competitiveness. The
Milk Development Council (MDC) collects a
levy on all milk produced and sold by all
farmers in Great Britain, to be spent on R & D
and other projects to help the milk sector.
The British Wool Marketing Board retains
its statutory powers to collect and sell Britain’s
wool clip (45.6 million kilograms in 1996) on
behalf of 82,302 registered producers.
Co-operatives and other farmers’
businesses handle much of the marketing of
agricultural and horticultural produce, such as
grain, fruit and vegetables. These had a
turnover of some £7,100 million in 1996.
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
Four government departments have joint
responsibility for agriculture and fisheries
matters: MAFF; the Scottish Office
Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries
Department (SOAEFD); the Welsh Office;
and the Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland. MAFF’s regional
administrative structure in England consists of
nine Regional Service Centres (RSCs). Their
work relates to payments under domestic and
EU schemes, licensing and various other
services provided to farmers and growers.
The ten MAFF Inspectorates (such as the
Sea Fisheries Inspectorate and the Plant
Health and Seeds Inspectorate) enforce
quality and health standards in animals, fish,
and crops.
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
The original aims of the CAP in 1962 were to
increase productivity and efficiency, to ensure
a fair standard of living for producers, to
stabilise markets and to guarantee supplies to
consumers at reasonable prices. The main
mechanisms for achieving this were a
combination of support prices, import duties
and market intervention. When prices of main
commodities fell below certain agreed levels,
intervention authorities (in Britain the
Intervention Board executive agency) bought
the goods and stored them for later resale.
Intervention stocks were exported or disposed
of within the EU, where this could be done
without disrupting internal markets. The
market support system not only raised food
prices for consumers but encouraged surplus
production. (Production rose by 2 per cent a
year between 1973 and 1988.) Exports, either
from the market or from intervention stocks,
attracted export refunds (or an export tax) to
fill the gap between EU and world prices.
The reforms of 1992 moved the CAP away
from supporting price levels, and intervention
arrangements were made less attractive.
Farmers now receive most of their financial
support in the form of direct payments from
the Exchequer under various arable and
livestock schemes (see pp. 291-4) and much
less now comes from the consumer through
increased food prices. Conditions, in the form

of quotas at producer level or obligations to
‘set-aside’ land, are placed on those who
receive these payments, in order to control
production. The Government funds
expenditure in Britain on CAP measures and
later claims reimbursement from the EU.
Britain contributes to this reimbursement
through payments to the EU budget, to which
it is a net contributor.
All CAP support prices and direct subsidy
payments are set in European Currency Units
(ECUs) and are then converted into the
currencies of the member states at special rates
of exchange, so-called ‘green rates’. These
green rates are kept broadly in line with
market rates in accordance with agreed rules.
The strengthening of sterling from mid-1996,
which coincided with a weakening of the
Deutschmark and other EU currencies,
resulted in a series of revaluations of the
British green rate, the first such since August
1993. These revaluations ended the trend in
1994—95 of green rate devaluations and
consequent increases in CAP payments and
amounts. Nevertheless, the sterling green rate
remained 9.4 per cent more generous in June
1997 than in January 1992.
Nearly all the EU’s expenditure on
agricultural support is channelled through the
European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). The Fund’s
guarantee section (with a budget of £29,730
million in 1997) finances market support
arrangements, including direct payments
made under the CAP, while the guidance
section (budget of £2,731 million in 1997)
provides funds for structural reform—for
example, hill livestock compensatory
allowances (HLCAs; see pp. 291-2) and
payments to assist certain farmers to change to
alternative enterprises.
In addition, Europe Agreements have been
concluded in respect of most agricultural
products to boost trade with, and to help the
economies of, Central European countries
while they prepare for accession to the EU.
But EU farm exports to Central Europe have
increased far more than the other way round,
contrary to the original intention. Trade
concessions are to be built into the
Agreements and the GATT Uruguay Round
conclusions (see p. 291) will be taken into
account, to ensure that Central Europe’s
access to the EU market is fairly arranged.
BSE: Government Response
The announcement in March 1996 of a
possible link between BSE and a new variant
of CJD caused an immediate EU worldwide
ban on exports of British beef and beef
products (see pp. 283-4).
The Florence Agreement of June 1996
provided a mechanism for resumption of
exports, subject to certain conditions being
satisfied and the opinion of various EU
scientific committees and of the Commission.
The agreement set down five preconditions
before exports could be resumed, and Britain
considered that it had fulfilled these by
February 1997. The agreement also set out
five steps for the resumption of exports. On
the first step, Britain’s initial proposals for the
export of beef and beef products from herds
certified as having no association with BSE
(Export Certified Herds Scheme) were
criticised by the EU Scientific Veterinary
Committee in June 1997. However, in July the
Government put forward a revised Export
Certified Herds Scheme and is currently
discussing a new proposal for an export
scheme for beef from animals born after a
specified date. A series of government and EU
289
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
measures have been taken to combat BSE and
to support the beef industry (at a total
estimated cost of £1,370 million to British
public funds), as follows:
Protection of Public and Animal Health
• Continued ban on specified material from
bovine animals, and, from September
1996, on the heads of sheep and goats.
The latter controls were applied against
the theoretical possibility of BSE in
sheep: there is no evidence that BSE is
present in the British flock. In July 1997
the EU adopted decision 97/534, which
will apply from 1 January 1998 an EU-
wide prohibition on the use for any
purpose of skulls, including brain and
eyes, tonsils and spinal cord of cattle,
sheep and goats over 12 months old and
the spleens of all sheep and goats.
• Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS),
given effect by Commission regulation
96/716. This excludes all animals over
30 months old from the human and
animal food chains and is based on a
system of approved abattoirs and
collection centres. It had resulted in the
slaughter of 1.7 million animals by
August 1997.
• Removal of mammalian meat and
bonemeal (MBM) from the livestock feed
chain, a ban on MBM fis fertiliser on
agricultural land, a Feed Recall Scheme
to remove residual MBM stocks, and
legal penalties for holding MBM on
premises where animal feed is handled.
• Selective cull of cattle born between
1 July 1989 and 30 June 1993.
Support for Industry
• Calf Processing Aid Scheme (CPAS),
which takes calves out of production
early, preventing further overproduction
of animals which would have no market.
• The Government ensures that reasonable
quantities of beef are being accepted into
intervention.
• Additional supplements under the
Suckler Cow and Beef Special Premium
schemes (see below).
• Short-term emergency aid, to be phased
out in 1997-98, to the slaughtering and
rendering industries. Slaughterhouses
and cutting plants received support in
1996_97. Help for the rendering industry
was based on maintenance of tenderers’
income levels for MBM and tallow.
• Help under the Beef Assurance Scheme,
introduced in 1996, for those mainly
grass-fed specialist beef herds with no
history of BSE, and considered to be at
very low risk of having a case of BSE in
the future, in which the cattle mature
slowly and are slaughtered over the age of
30 months. By the end of August 1997,
72 herds were registered under the
scheme.
• Cattle Passport Scheme (see p. 295).
Research
MAFF spent £6.8 million in 1996-97 on
research into BSE and related diseases,
bringing the total to over £30 million since the
start of the epidemic in 1986. A further
allocation of £12.6 million has been made for
research in 1997-98. The programme will
continue at or around this level for at least the
next three years.
EU Funding
Payments under the CPAS (£53.8 million in
1996- 97 and provisionally £62.3 million in
1997- 98) are wholly EU-funded; those under
the OTMS (£863 million in 1996-97 and
provisionally £348.6 million in 1997—98) are
partly EU-funded. (Britain meets the costs of
slaughtering and destruction of carcasses,
£131 million [excluding VAT] in 1996-97,
under the OTMS.) In addition, the EU has
provided support through intervention buying
of beef, as well as supplements to, and
increases in the advances of, EU premium
payments to beef producers (see below).
The EU agreed two aid packages for the
beef sector. Under the first, £110 million was

made available to Britain, of which £81
million was distributed in the form of a top-up
of the suckler cow and beef special premiums.
The Government decided to use the
remaining £29 million to fund a beef
marketing payments scheme (BMPS), under
which payments worth £66.78 a head were
made on adult cattle sold for human
consumption between 20 March and 30 June
1996. A further £29 million of national funds
were made available to allow the BMPS to be
extended to cover cattle slaughtered between
1 July and 30 September (£55 a head) and
between 1 October and 9 November (£34
a head).
The second aid package provided some £52
million to Britain, most of which (£49.5
million) was distributed in top-up payments
under the 1996 Suckler Cow Premium
Scheme and in payments to the owners of
Northern Ireland herds which have had cases
of BSE. The remainder was spent on
promoting the beef industry and on a small-
scale aid scheme for veal producers.
CAP Expenditure on Livestock in Britain
Beef Special Premium is paid on male bovine
animals in certain age ranges. In 1996 payments
worth £93.11 were made for first premium
animals (aged at least 10 months and under 23
months) and second premium animals (23
months and over). A single premium for bulls
aged between 10 and 23 months was introduced
in 1997, with a higher payment rate than for
steers—which continue to attract two
payments. Supplement granted in 1996 (to help
producers who suffered through disruption of
the beef market) was worth £19.70 a head.
Estimated expenditure in respect of the 1997
scheme, including extensification premium, is
£140 million for England and £261 million for
Britain as a whole.
Suckler Coip Premium is paid on suckler cows
rearing beef calves. In 1996, premium was worth
£124.12 a head, with supplements of £23.13
and, separately, £30 to help offset the effects of
market disruption. Estimated expenditure in
respect of the 1997 scheme, including
extensification premium, is £98 million for
England and £201 million for Britain.
Two levels of extensification premium are
paid under the Beef Special Premium and the
Suckler Cow Premium schemes. A supplement
of about £29 an animal is paid if the producer
has a stocking density of less than 1.4 livestock
units (LU) a hectare of forage area or £42 an
animal if the stocking density is less than 1 LU
a hectare of forage area.
EU beef intervention schemes came to
about £156 million in 1996-97. Intervention
coverage accounted for more than half of
Britain’s saleable production. For the EU as a
whole the ceiling for beef intervention was
increased to 555,000 tonnes. About 44,000
tonnes (carcass weight) of beef were accepted
for purchase into intervention in Britain
during 1996-97.
Sheep Annual Premium. Producers received
a payment of £13.66 an eligible ewe under the
1996 Sheep Annual Premium Scheme. A
supplement of £5.38 per eligible ewe was paid
to Less Favoured Area (LFA) producers.
Total payments in Britain in 1996-97 were
£453.9 million, with a total quota of 19.64
million units (8.6 million in England; 4.3
million in Scotland).2

liberalisation. For the first time the key
elements of import protection, domestic
support and subsidised exports were subjected
to a framework of specific disciplines designed
to reduce distortions in world agricultural
trade. In preparation for implementing the
new regime the EU made major changes in its
cereals, oilseeds and livestock support
arrangements designed to make them more
competitive.
Negotiations to liberalise agricultural trade
further will start in 2000. These will put
pressure on the CAP to bring exports into line
with world market levels. The outcome would
mean further liberalisation through lower
protection, a weakening of domestic support
arrangements, which distort production and
trade, and yet stricter disciplines on the use of
export subsidies.
Price Guarantees, Grants and Subsidies
Expenditure in Britain in 1996-97 under the
CAP and by the agriculture and other
departments (including funding for special
areas) on conservation measures was estimated
at £4,142 million and £271.5 million
respectively.
In LFAs, where land quality is poor, farmers
benefit from higher rates of HLCAs. These are
headage payments on breeding cattle and sheep,
and their purpose is to support the continuation
of livestock farming in hills and uplands, thus
conserving the countryside and encouraging
people to remain in the LFAs.
In 1997 producers in the LFA (United
Kingdom)3 received direct livestock subsidy
payments of £650 million, of which £162
million came from HLCAs (see Table 18.5).
An additional £60 million was made available
to upland cattle farmers in Britain through the
HLCA scheme to compensate for a downturn
in LFA incomes.
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and Wales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who want
' Designation of LFA status is decided by the EU. The case for
LFAs in Britain was submitted to the EU as covering all of Britain.
to farm on their own account. Councils may
lend working capital to them. At 31 March
1995 there were approximately 4,700
smallholdings in England and 840 in Wales.
Land settlement in Scotland has been carried
out by the Government, which still owns and
maintains 105,069 hectares (259,520 acres) of
land settlement estates, comprising 1,412
crofts and holdings.
In northern Scotland—Highland, parts of
Argyll and Bute, Western Isles, Orkney and
Shetland—much of the land is tenanted by
crofters (smallholders), who enjoy the
statutory protection provided by crofting
legislation and can benefit from government
agriculture and livestock improvement
schemes. Most crofters are part-time
agriculturalists, using croft income to
supplement income from other activities. The
Crofters Commission has a statutory duty to
promote their interests and to keep all crofting
matters under review. The Transfer of
Crofting Estates (Scotland) Act 1997 allows
the Government to transfer some of its own
crofting land to trusts set up by resident
crofters, with the aim of giving them more
responsibility for their own affairs.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
About one-third of agricultural land in
England and Wales is rented. The
Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 provides a
simplified legal framework for new tenancies
entered into on or after 1 September 1995,
known as farm business tenancies (FBTs). In
the first Annual Survey of Tenanted Land,
carried out in October 1996, 559 FBT
agreements were recorded in the sample
representing over 11 per cent of all types of
agreement. Landowners benefit from full
relief from inheritance tax on FBTs.
In Scotland about 40 per cent of farmland
is rented, partly reflecting the relatively large
areas of land in crofting tenure, including
common grazings.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but the conacre system allows
occupiers not wishing to farm all their land to
let it annually to others. Conacre land—about
one-fifth of agricultural land—is used mainly
for grazing.

AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY & FORESTRY
Agriculture and Protection of the
Countryside
Britain’s agri-environment programme, under
EU agri-environment regulation 2078/92,
provides voluntary incentive schemes to
encourage environmentally beneficial farming
practices. The Government normally evaluates
and reviews the schemes every five years.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs)
The ESA scheme (see Table 18.6) remains
Britain’s largest environmental scheme.
Farmers within designated areas receive
annual payments for carrying out practices
which benefit nature conservation, the
landscape and preservation of historic
features.
Participation in the scheme is voluntary.
Farmers enter into 10-year agreements with
the relevant agriculture department. An
agreement specifies the agricultural
management practices they will carry out.
Each ESA has varying tiers of such practices,
from basic care and maintenance to more
extensive forms of management and
mvironmental restoration. Details also vary,
3ut participants may not convert grassland to
arable and are subject to restrictions on
fertiliser and chemical usage.
Most ESAs also restrict or control the
lumbers of stock on the land as well as the
iming of cultivation. The annual payments
between £6 and ^415 a hectare, depending
in the needs of each tier) are designed to
:ompensate for reduced profitability because
if these less intensive production methods,
ind for the further work some management
practices need. Additional payments are made
for specific items, such as hedgerows and
stone wall renewal, habitat creation, and for
allowing public access to suitable farmland.
After public consultation, several new tiers
and options were introduced into the first five
English ESAs, including, in February 1997:
enhancement of herb-rich pastures in the
Pennine Dales; creation of fens in the Norfolk
Broads to increase biodiversity and improve
important habitats; and encouragement of
winter stubbles, to attract farmland birds, in
the South Downs and West Penwith. The
areas of four of these ESAs were also
extended. Proposals for the development of 11
of the other English ESAs have been issued
for further consultation.
Countryside Stewardship
Countryside Stewardship is the main
government incentive scheme in England for
the wider English countryside outside the
ESAs. It offers payments to farmers and
landowners to improve the natural heritage and
biodiversity, under 10-year agreements. It
targets chalk and limestone grassland, lowland
heath, waterside land, coast, uplands, historic
landscapes, old orchards, countryside around
towns, field boundaries (such as walls, ditches
and hedgerows), old meadows and pastures, and
uncropped margins in arable fields. MAFF
signed 1,105 agreements with farmers in
England in 1996, building up the total to 6,225,
covering 107,000 hectares (264,400 acres). By
1998-99 total payments to farmers will have
risen to over £20 million, including £0.5 million
under a pilot scheme for arable land to be
introduced as part of Countryside Stewardship.

Organic Aid Schemes
Four such schemes cover England, Northern
Ireland, Scotland and Wales. These offer
support for the conversion of land to organic
production methods. Land thus entered
attracts payments for five years from the start
of conversion. Payments are on a reducing
scale starting at up to £70 a hectare. An
additional £30 a hectare is payable on the first
5 hectares entered into a scheme.
From June 1996 the Organic Conversion
Information Service has operated in England
and from October in Wales. This provides free
Helpline information and advisory visits to
prospective organic farmers.
By the end of March 1997, 5,482 hectares
(13,540 acres) had been entered into
conversion in England. The scheme in
Scotland has seen 19,062 hectares (47,102
acres) put into conversion. Total expenditure
under the schemes in Britain is about
£520,300 in 1996-97—£400,000 in England
and £88,247 in Scotland. There is also a
programme of R & D worth about £1 million,
and support is given for the UK Register of
Organic Food Standards, which is charged
with overseeing standards of such food
production. There were 784 registered organic
holdings in Britain in June 1995, although in
1997 organic farming still only accounted for
0.3 per cent of the total.
Other Schemes
Other schemes within Britain’s agri¬
environment programme include:
• Nitrate Sensitive Areas;
• Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (see p. 351);
• Arable Area Payments Scheme;
• Farm Woodland Premium Scheme;
• British Habitat Schemes;
• Tir Cymen Scheme (in Wales);
• Moorland Schemes; and
• Countryside Access Scheme.
In Scotland, the Habitat, Moorland and
Access schemes became part of the Scottish
Countryside Premium Scheme from March
1997.
The Rural Economy and
EU Structural Funds
Eleven areas in Great Britain (including South
West England, the English Northern Uplands,
70 per cent of the landmass of Wales, and
Dumfries and Galloway) have been designated
eligible to receive funds under Objective 5b of
the EU Structural Funds. Objective 5b aims
to promote the economic development of rural
areas by supporting the provision of business
advice, infrastructure development,
diversification, marketing local and regional
products, and measures to enhance and
conserve the environment. Areas must have a
high share of agricultural employment in total
employment, a low level of agricultural
income and a low population density.
The EU has allocated £376 million to the
six Objective 5b programmes in England for
the six years 1994-99. Of this, some £112
million is to come from the Government and
the EAGGF specifically to assist the
agricultural sector.
Northern Ireland, the Highlands and
Islands of Scotland and Merseyside qualify for
assistance under Objective 1 of the EU
Structural Funds, which aims to help those
regions whose economic development lags
behind the EU average. Some £33 million was
spent on measures funded under Objective 1
in Northern Ireland in 1996—97.
Linked to Objective 5b is the LEADER II
initiative, designed to help small-scale,
innovative measures of benefit to local areas.
The EU has allocated over £20 million to
England and over £16 million to Scotland for
LEADER II measures. With matching
national public funds, almost £7 million is
available to give direct support to agriculture.
Agricultural Training
ATB-Landbase Limited provides Industry
Training Organisation (see p. 174) and other
services for agriculture and commercial
horticulture, under contract to MAFF. The
contract for the three years 1997-2000 is worth
£1.5 million and complements funding
provided by the Department for Education and
Employment, including work on the
development of national standards. ATB-
294
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY & FORESTRY
Landbase also receives funding under the
Sector Challenge (see p. 196). Two projects,
worth a total of £ 1.9 million over three years,
involve support for the training infrastructure
and the provision of information on training and
business development. MAFF also contributes
to the educational activities of the National
Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs. The
agricultural colleges and other independent
organisations also provide training.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales ADAS, formerly an
executive agency of MAFF and the Welsh
Office, provides professional, business,
scientific and technical services in the
agriculture, food and drink, and environmental
markets. Consultancy is on a fee-paying basis.
ADAS was privatised in 1997, the sale being to
a management buy-out team; it did not include
ADAS farms, which are leased to the new
owners. A new Farming and Rural Conservancy
Agency carries out statutory work no longer
undertaken by ADAS. The Government pays
for free initial advice on conservation and the
prevention of pollution. In England this
advice is provided through ADAS and, in the
case of conservation, also through the Farming
and Wildlife Advisory Group. Similar services
in Scotland come from the SOAEFD through
the Scottish Agricultural College. In Northern
Ireland they are available from the
Department of Agriculture’s agriculture and
science services.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain enforces controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including checks
on all individual consignments originating
from outside the EU and frequent checks on
those from other EU member states at
destination points. Measures can be taken to
prevent the importation of diseased animals
and genetic material from regions or countries
affected by disease. Veterinary checks also
include unannounced periods of surveillance
at ports.
The number of confirmed cases of BSE in
Britain is falling by about 40 per cent each
year. Scientists at the University of Oxford
predict that there will be about 7,000 more
cases before the disease falls to very low
levels in 2001.
Compulsory cattle passports were
introduced in Great Britain from 1 July 1996.
All cattle, born here or imported after that date,
must have a valid passport. It is an offence for
animals born or imported after 30 June 1996 to
be without one. (Up to the end of August 1997,
3.3 million passports had been issued.) The
Cattle Passport Order 1996 prohibits the
movement of such cattle on or off holdings.
Failure to obtain a cattle passport may result in
a fine of up to £5,000 and the animal’s
ineligibility for slaughter for human
consumption. The passport records eartag
number, sex, breed, date of birth, dam
identification number and name and address of
original keeper. The information is recorded in
the agriculture department’s cattle passport
system database. When the animal is moved off
the farm, the keeper must enter the movement
details on the passport and record them in the
farm register. The Government aims to
establish a computer-based system to register
all cattle and their movements. It will hold
identification details and record movements
from birth to death, including those through
markets and to abattoirs, of all cattle born in or
imported into Great Britain, after the system
becomes operational. This will be as soon as
possible in 1998, well ahead of the EU deadline
of 31 December 1999. In Northern Ireland, the
Department of Agriculture has operated such a
system since 1990, detailing the registration
and movements of 1.6 million cattle.
The Government has commissioned further
research from the Institute of Occupational
Medicine into the effects of organophosphorus
sheep dips on users’ health. The project is
costing £500,000 and the results are due in 1999.
Professional advice and action on the
statutory control of animal disease and the
welfare of farm livestock are the responsibility
of the SYS. It is supported by the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA), a primary
supplier of specialist veterinary advice to
295
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
MAFF, which also offers its services to the
private sector on a commercial basis. A similar
service is provided in Scotland by the Scottish
Agricultural College and in Northern Ireland
by the Department of Agriculture’s Veterinary
Science Laboratories.
Rabies
Dogs, cats and certain other mammals are
subject to import licence and six months’
quarantine. Commercially traded dogs and
cats from other EU countries which satisfy
strict conditions are allowed entry without
quarantine. There are severe penalties for
breaking the law. No cases of rabies outside
quarantine have occurred in Northern Ireland
since 1923 and in Britain as a whole since
1970, except for an isolated incident with a bat
in 1996. The requirement for imported
animals to be quarantined is under review.
Fish
Controls to prevent the introduction and
spread of serious diseases of fish and shellfish
include restrictions on live fish imports and on
the deposit of shellfish on the seabed, and
movement restrictions on sites where outbreaks
of notifiable diseases have been confirmed.
Plants
The agriculture departments apply statutory
controls to implement the EU plant health
regime, designed to prevent the introduction
or spread of particularly harmful plant pests
and disease. They also provide non-statutory
services, including certification of exports to
third countries and schemes for maintaining
the health status of plant propagating material
in Britain.
Pesticides
British legislation comprehensively controls
pesticides so as to protect the health of humans,
creatures and plants, safeguard the
environment, and secure safe, efficient and
humane methods of pest control. These
arrangements are being extended into the wider
EU arrangements which are being
progressively brought into effect. The
Pesticides Safety Directorate, an executive
agency of MAFF, is responsible for the
evaluation and approval of agricultural
pesticides in Great Britain. It also provides
policy advice to MAFF in respect of the safety
and effectiveness of pesticides and monitors
their usage.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate is
responsible to agriculture and health ministers
for ensuring that authorised veterinary
medicines meet standards of safety, quality
and efficacy. Users of medicines, the health
and welfare of treated animals, safety of
consumers of food from treated animals, and
the environment are all matters of concern.
The independent scientific Veterinary
Products Committee advises the Government.
The Fishing Industry
In 1996 the fishing industry provided about 54
per cent by quantity of total British fish
supplies. Household consumption of fish in
Britain, at 470,000 tonnes, showed an increase
of over 7 per cent since 1995. Over the past
two years there has been a substantial increase
in the consumption of fresh and frozen fish,
fish products and shellfish.
Fisheries departments are responsible for
the administration of legislation, in
partnership with the European Commission,
concerning the fishing industry, including fish
and shellfish farming.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority (SFIA)
is an industry financed body. It undertakes
R & D, provides training and encourages
quality awareness. In 1996 the SFIA paid, on
behalf of fisheries departments, almost £1
million in vessel safety grants involving some
319 projects, thus helping owners with work
necessary to obtain an official safety certificate.
Fish Caught
In 1996 demersal fish (caught on or near the
bottom of the sea) accounted for 46 per cent
296
by weight of total landings by British fishing
vessels, pelagic fish (caught near the surface)
for 39 per cent and shellfish for 16 per cent.
Landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon
and trout) by British fishing vessels in Britain
totalled 635,000 tonnes compared with
725,600 tonnes in 1995. Cod and haddock
represented 22 and 16 per cent respectively of
the total value of demersal and pelagic fish
landed, while anglerfish (15 per cent), whiting
(6 per cent), and plaice and mackerel (5 per
cent each) were the other most important
sources of earnings to the industry. The
quayside value of landings of all sea fish,
including shellfish, by British vessels in 1996
was £491 million.
Total allowable catches (TACs) for 1997
(see below) produced British quotas of
485,000 tonnes (expressed as cod equivalent),
compared with 547,000 tonnes in 1995 and
512,000 tonnes in 1996. British vessels also
have access to stocks where no allocation is
made between EU member states.
The Fishing Fleet
Given the continuing pressure on fish stocks,
the Government considers that effective
fisheries management and enforcement are
essential to the future viability of the fishing
industry. All British vessels fishing for profit
must be licensed by the fisheries departments.
To help conserve stocks and contain the size
of the fleet only replacement licences are
issued. Quotas are allocated annually to
groups of fishermen, mainly the producer
organisations, in proportion to their catches
over the previous three years. In 1996, 31 out
of 78 quotas were fished to within 95-105 per
cent of allocation; the number of quotas
overfished by more than 5 per cent was six.
National and EU regulations are enforced
through aerial and marine surveillance and by
shore-based Sea Fisheries Inspectorates,
which also collect information on fishing
activity. There were 66 prosecutions for
Scotland alone resulting from infringements
committed in 1996 and in earlier years.
Under the EU’s Multi-Annual Guidance
Programme all member states have been set
targets for reducing their fleets. Britain aims
to achieve this objective through substantial
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY & FORESTRY
cuts in the fishing fleet and limits on the time
vessels spend at sea. Some 8.2 per cent of
tonnage has been removed in four tendering
rounds: 4,755 gross registered tonnes (GRT)
in 1993, 5,270 GRT in 1994, 4,206 GRT in
1995, and 3,381 GRT in 1996, at a cost of
£36.4 million. At the end of 1995 the British
fleet consisted of 9,174 registered vessels,
including 448 deep-sea vessels longer than
24.4 m (80 ft).
Fish Farming and Shellfish Production
Production of salmon and trout in Britain has
grown from less than 1,000 tonnes in the early
1970s to 83,121 tonnes of salmon in Scotland
and 4,635 tonnes (Scotland) of trout in 1996.
Scotland produces the largest amount of
farmed salmon (with a first-sale value of £220
million) in the EU. Shellfish farming
concentrates on molluscs such as oysters,
mussels, clams and scallops, producing an
estimated 1,390 tonnes (Scotland) a year.
The fish and shellfish farming industries,
predominantly in the Highlands and Islands of
Scotland, were estimated to have a combined
wholesale turnover of some £227 million in
1996.
Production in Great Britain is based on
1,154 businesses operating from 1,628 sites
and employing more than 3,000 people.
Fishery Limits
British fishery limits extend to 200 miles or
the median line (broadly halfway between the
British coast and the opposing coastline of
another coastal state), measured from
baselines on or near the coast of Britain.
Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)
For the EU as a whole, catching capacity
exceeds available fish. The EU’s CFP system
for the conservation and management of
fishing resources sets TACs each year in order
to conserve stocks. TACs are then allocated as
quotas between member states on a fixed
percentage basis, taking account of traditional
fishing patterns. In December 1996, the EU
cut quotas for a number of stocks, including

North Sea cod, in view of the pressure on
them. In April 1997, the EU agreed to cut
fishing effort by up to 30 per cent over five
years.
British vessels have exclusive rights to fish
within 6 miles of the British coast. Certain
other EU member states have historic rights in
British waters between 6 and 12 miles. British
vessels have similar rights in other member
states’ 6 to 12 mile belts, subject to transitional
arrangements for the newer member states.
Between 12 and 200 miles EU vessels may fish
wherever they have been allocated a share of
the EU’s TAG against agreed EU quotas,
and/or an ‘effort allocation’ in the case of
western waters. Non-EU countries’ vessels
may fish in these waters if they negotiate
reciprocal fisheries agreements. Currently the
only countries are Norway and the Faroes.
Technical conservation measures
supplement TAC and effort controls. They
include minimum mesh sizes for nets and net
configuration restrictions, minimum landing
sizes and closed areas designed mainly to
protect young fish.
Each member state is responsible for
enforcement of CFP rules on its own
fishermen and those of other member states in
its own waters. EU inspectors monitor
compliance.
Measures to control fishing by all member
states in western waters took effect in 1996.
Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels are
excluded from the North Sea, the Irish Sea
and the Bristol Channel.
Quota Hoppers
About 10 per cent of Britain’s quota stocks are
taken by British registered fishing vessels
which are partly or wholly foreign-owned.
There are an estimated 160 such vessels,
accounting for some 25 per cent of the tonnage
of Britain’s offshore fleet. Although overseas
investment in the British fleet is permissible
under the Maastricht Treaty, the Commission
confirmed to the Government in 1997 that
there are steps which Britain may take to
ensure that vessels maintain a real economic
link with its coastal areas dependent on fishing
and related industries. Such measures are
expected to operate from 1998, after
consultation with the fishing industry.
The Government insists on fisheries
enforcement both to conserve fish stocks and
to safeguard the long-term interests of the
industry. It has also obtained a commitment
from the Commission to examine the
operation of EU control arrangements and to
present a report, with proposals, to the EU
before the end of 1997.
Grant Schemes
The fishing industry in England, Wales and
Scotland has benefited from some £96 million
298
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY & FORESTRY
in EU fisheries grants over the three years
1994-95 to 1996-97. Among grant schemes
which provide aid are:
• Vessel Safety Grant Schemes-1—EU and
national schemes available towards the
costs of equipment necessary for a vessel
to obtain a safety certificate;
• an EU scheme to improve facilities for
fishermen at fishing ports;
• Aquaculture and Development of
Enclosed Seawater Areas—an EU
scheme, at present operating only in
Scotland, for investments in fish
farming and protection of enclosed
coastal waters;
• the PESCA scheme—an EU scheme
to assist the restructuring of the
fisheries sector and to encourage the
diversification of economic activities in
areas dependent on fishing; and
• an EU scheme for decommissioning
fishing vessels.
All the EU grants are backed by
contributions from the Government or other
public authorities.
Fisheries Agreements
CFP provisions are supplemented by a
number of fisheries agreements between the
EU and third countries, the most important
for Britain being the agreements with
Norway, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
EU catch quotas have also been established
around Spitsbergen (Svalbard).
Fish and Shellfish Hygiene
Community legislation sets minimum
hygiene standards for the production and
marketing of fish and shellfish. All
commercial shellfish beds producing live
bivalve molluscs are monitored for microbial
contamination. Shellfishharvesting areas are
then classified according to EU criteria.
Samples of seawater and shellfish flesh are
tested for the presence of biotoxins and
chemical contaminants.
Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Salmon and sea-trout are fished commercially
in inshore waters and estuaries around the
British coast. Eels and elvers are also taken
commercially in both estuaries and fresh
water. Angling for salmon and sea-trout (game
fishing) and for freshwater species (coarse
fishing) is popular throughout Britain. There
is no public right to fish in freshwater lakes
and non-tidal rivers in Great Britain. Those
wishing to fish such waters must first obtain
permission from the owner of the fishing
rights and, in England and Wales, a licence
from the Environment Agency. In Scotland
salmon fisheries are managed locally by
District Salmon Fishery Boards. In Northern
Ireland fishing for freshwater species is
licensed by the Fisheries Conservancy Board
for Northern Ireland and the Foyle Fisheries
Commission in their respective areas, and 65
public angling waters, including salmon, trout
and coarse fisheries, are accessible to
Department of Agriculture permit holders.
Fisheries and the Aquatic Environment
The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and
Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), from April
1997 a government agency, is the new name for
the MAFF fisheries and aquatic environment
research laboratories, formerly known as the
Directorate of Fisheries Research. It provides
research, assessment and advice on marine and
freshwater fisheries science and management,
aquaculture, fish and shellfish hygiene, disease
control and diagnostics, environmental
research and monitoring, and environmental
impacts, to MAFF and to other customers
worldwide. MAFF also commissions research
work from other bodies, such as the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC), the
SFIA and a number of universities. CEFAS
has two seagoing research vessels.
In Scotland, Fisheries Research Service,
based in Aberdeen, monitors marine and
freshwater resources.
The Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland laboratories undertake
research on marine and freshwater fisheries
and their environments, aquaculture and
oceanography.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Research
Departmental funding of R & D in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 1997-98 includes funding
by MAFF (£126 million), the SOAEFD (£47
million), and the Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland (£7.5 million).
MAFF supports an intake of about 70
postgraduate students each year at an annual
cost of almost £1.7 million. The scheme is
intended to fund research relevant to the
Ministry’s overall aims and strategy, and to
further the education of future agriculturalists,
economists and food scientists.
Agriculture and Food
MAFF’s nutrition research programme has
shown, for example, that increased
consumption of mono-unsaturated fatty acids,
such as those found in olive oil, can decrease
blood cholesterol levels by 10 per cent without
the need for a reduction in overall fat intake.
Meanwhile, investment in technologies in key
British wheat crops has resulted in various
promising transformation systems for wheat,
which may lead to improved quality
characteristics and pest and disease resistance.
MAFF is to participate in a £5 million LINK
programme, aimed at promoting sustainable
production of cereals and other arable crops; it
will contribute up to £2.5 million over five
years—funds which will be matched by
industry sponsors.
Research Bodies
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC; see p. 339)
supports research in biotechnology and
biological sciences related to food and
agriculture. The NERC is responsible for
research on the environment, including some
agricultural aspects. Research institutes
sponsored by these councils receive income
from work commissioned by MAFF, by
industry and by other bodies.
ADAS carries out R & D, through regional
centres and on clients’ premises, for MAFF
and for other bodies. There are research centres
across England and Wales. MAFF receives
scientific expertise and technical support from
its other agencies, the VLA and the Central
Science Laboratory, commissioning research
from them as well as through open
competition. Horticulture Research
International, a non-departmental public body,
transfers the results of its R & D to the British
horticulture industry and the wider public.
The five Scottish Agricultural and
Biological Research Institutes, funded by the
SOAEFD, cover areas of research relevant to
the conditions of northern Britain. The
SOAEFD also funds agricultural research,
education and advisory services at the Scottish
Agricultural College, which operates from
three centres. In Northern Ireland the
Department of Agriculture conducts publicly
funded basic and strategic research in
specialist divisions and conducts applied
research contracted by external customers. It
also funds and provides facilities and teaching
for the Queen’s University of Belfast and the
Agricultural Research Institute of Northern
Ireland.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2.4 million
hectares (6 million acres) in Britain: about 8
per cent of England, 15 per cent of Scotland,
12 per cent of Wales and 6 per cent of
Northern Ireland. This is over 10 per cent of
the total land area and well below the 25 per
cent average for the whole of Europe.
Britain’s forestry programme protects
forest resources and conserves woodland as a
home for wildlife and for public recreation. It
also promotes the market for home-grown
timber. The aim is to double the area of tree
cover in England and increase woodlands in
Wales by 50 per cent by the middle of the next
century. Continued forestry expansion in
Scotland is also a commitment.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2.2 million hectares (5.5 million
acres), 36 per cent of which is managed by the
Forestry Commission. The rate of new
planting (including natural regeneration) in
1996-97 was 461 hectares (1,139 acres) by the
Commission and 15,971 hectares (39,464
acres) by other woodland owners, with the
help of grants from the Commission, mainly
in Scotland. In 1996-97, 9,198 hectares
300
AGRICULTURE, THE FISHING INDUSTRY & FORESTRY
(22,728 acres) of broadleaved trees were
planted, a practice encouraged on suitable sites.
The forest area has more than doubled since
1919. During 1987-96, 207,388 hectares
(512,476 acres) of new woodland were created.
Forestry and primary wood processing employ
about 35,000 people. Britain’s woodlands
produced 8.72 million cubic metres (308
million cubic feet) of timber in 1996—15 per
cent of total consumption. Provision has been
made for new planting in Great Britain
amounting to 63,500 hectares (156,900 acres) in
the three years 1997-98 to 1999-2000,
comprising 62,800 hectares (155,185 acres) by
the private sector and 700 hectares (1,730 acres)
by Forest Enterprise.
The volume of timber harvested on
Commission lands in 1996-97 was estimated at
4.7 million cubic metres (165 million cubic feet).
The Commission’s Woodland Grant
Scheme pays grants to help create new
woodlands and forests, and regenerate existing
ones. Under the scheme a Management Grant
is available for work in woods of special
conservation and landscape value or where the
public are welcome. Two new challenge funds
started in 1996: the First to bring
undermanaged or low value woodlands back
into better care; the second to enhance the
diversity of wildlife in Cairngorms semi¬
natural woodlands, Argyll and Bute oak
woods, and Welsh upland oak woods, and to
improve conditions for butterflies in English
coppice woodlands. EU co-financing of grants
will amount to about £31 million over
1997-98 to 1999-2000.
Annual payments to compensate farmers
for agricultural income foregone are also
available under the Farm Woodland Premium
Scheme (see p. 294).
The Forestry Commission and
Forestry Policy
The Forestry Commission, established in
1919, is the government department
responsible for forestry in Great Britain. With
over a million hectares of land (2.7 million
acres), it is Britain’s largest land manager and
the biggest single provider of countryside
recreation. The Commissioners advise on
forestry matters and are responsible to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the
Secretary of State for Wales.
Within the Commission, the Forestry
Authority provides grants to private woodland
owners for tree planting and woodland
management, controls tree felling, and sets
standards for the forestry industry as a whole.
Forest Enterprise, a Next Steps agency of the
Commission, develops and manages the
Commission’s forests and forestry estate,
supplying timber and opportunities for
recreation, and enhancing nature conservation
and the forest environment. The Forestry
Commission Research Agency came into being
in April 1997.
The Commission is financed partly by the
Government and partly by receipts from sales
of timber and other produce, and from rents.
Its grant in aid for 1996-97 was £64 million;
for 1997-98, £63 million. Provision will
decrease and £10 million will be deducted
each year for reimbursements for EU co¬
financing of private woodlands grants. Timber
receipts are also expected to grow as
production rises.
The Commission continues to sell forestry
land, at the rate of 1 per cent a year of its total
estate over a 10-year period. During 1989-97
some 81,000 hectares (200,000 acres) were sold.
There are safeguards for protecting continued
public access to former Commission woodland
after sale to private owners.
Native Scots pine woodlands in the
Scottish Highlands are recognised as a
Class 1 habitat in the EU Habitats
Directive, requiring positive management
action for restoration. The Forestry
Commission disburses grants to support
this objective.
Forestry Initiatives
The Forestry Commission continues to
promote forestry close to centres of
population. ‘Locational Supplements’ have
been introduced, at £600 a hectare and on a
three-year basis, to provide an incentive for
the planting of new woodlands in priority
areas—in the 12 Community Forests and the
301
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
National Forest in England, the Central
Scotland Forest and the Aman Gwendraeth
and North-East Wales initiatives.
The Millennium Commission (see p. 47)
has so far awarded £11.7 million to the
Millennium Forest for Scotland and £6.5
million to the Woodland Trust’s ‘Woods on
Your Doorstep’ programme to support and
advise on the creation of new community
woodlands in Britain.
The Forestry Authority works closely with
the Forestry Commission’s research division
and plant health branch to monitor forest
health and to prevent the entry of pests and
pathogens into Britain through imported
timber. Meanwhile, efforts to conserve the red
squirrel continue. Research suggests that some
pine or larch trees in otherwise pure spruce
crops can make a positive difference to red
squirrel populations.

Forestry in Northern Ireland
Woodland and forest cover about 81,000
hectares (200,000 acres) of Northern Ireland.
State-owned forest constitutes 61,000 hectares
(150,700 acres).
The Department of Agriculture for
Northern Ireland is responsible for forestry
through its Forest Service. It administers
grant aid for private planting and spent £15
million during 1993-96 supporting private and
state forestry. Additional supplements are
available where the land is coming out of
agriculture or provides recreation. Annual
timber production is about 250,000 cubic
metres (8.8 million cubic feet), 90 per cent
from state forests. Receipts from sales of
timber totalled £6 million in 1996—97.
Forestry and timber processing employ 1,100
people.

I Passenger travel within Britain and to overseas countries is continuing to rise.
The Government’s main focus of attention has switched to developing an
integrated transport policy, covering all aspects of public and private transport,
I and placing greater emphasis on environmental considerations. It is designed
to make better use of the existing facilities and infrastructure, with a higher
I priority envisaged for public transport. Britain has one of the most open
telecommunications markets in the world, and telecommunications services
are developing rapidly.
Transport
Travel Trends
i Passenger travel, in terms of passenger-
kilometres, has risen substantially in recent
decades, but during the 1990s the pattern has
! fluctuated, with travel declining in the early
1990s. Nevertheless, over the ten years to 1996
I travel grew by 27 per cent. Travel by car and
van rose by 33 per cent and, air travel also grew
i substantially. However, travel by bus and
coach and by motorcycle has fallen: Rail travel
i rose in the second half of the 1980s but
I declined in the early 1990s, although it
| recovered in 1995 and 1996.
Travel by car is by far the most popular
mode of passenger travel (see Table 19.1). Car
and van travel accounts for 86 per cent of
passenger mileage within Great Britain, buses
and coaches for 6 per cent, rail 5 per cent and
air 1 per cent. Most freight is carried by road,
which accounts for 81 per cent of goods by
tonnage and 66 per cent in terms of tonne-
kilometres.1
Car ownership has grown substantially. In
all, 69 per cent of households in Great Britain
owned one or more cars in 1996; 21 per cent
owned two or more cars. At the end of 1996
there were 26.3 million vehicles licensed for
use on the roads of Great Britain, including
22.2 million cars (of which 2.3 million were
company-owned); 2 million light goods
vehicles; 555,000 other goods vehicles;
739,000 motorcycles, scooters and niopeds;
and 158,000 buses and coaches (including
minibuses for private use).
1 A tonne-kilometre is equivalent to 1 tonne transported for 1
kilometre.

Integrated Transport Policy
The Government is committed to developing
an integrated transport policy to tackle
congestion and pollution, and to serve
Britain’s needs for a strong economy, a
sustainable environment and an inclusive
society. It believes that integrating decisions in
a broad range of policy areas, including
transport and land-use planning, will be
important in developing this policy. In June
1997, it merged the Department of the
Environment with the Department of
Transport to form the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR).
The Government is conducting a
fundamental review of transport policy, and in
August 1997 published a wide-ranging
consultation document. The review will cover
issues involving all modes of transport, both
passenger and freight, and will also
incorporate the review of the road programme
(see p. 305)
A White Paper will be published in spring
1998 which will set out the Government’s
transport strategy for Britain for both the long
and the short term. Separate White Papers or
policy statements will be published addressing
the specific issues and circumstances in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
ROADS
The total road network in Great Britain in
1996 was 368,800 kilometres (229,200 miles).
Trunk motorways2 accounted for 3,181
kilometres (1,977 miles) of this, less than 1 per
cent, and other trunk roads for over 12,350
kilometres (7,680 miles), or 3.4 per cent.
However, motorways carry 16 per cent of all
traffic, and trunk roads another 16 per cent.
Combined, they carry over half of all goods
vehicle traffic in Great Britain. In Northern
Ireland the road network is over 24,000
kilometres (15,000 miles), of which 112
kilometres (70 miles) are motorways.
Motor traffic in Great Britain in 1996 rose
by 2.7 per cent to an estimated 442,500 million
vehicle-kilometres (see Table 19.2). Traffic on
motorways has been growing particularly
quickly, rising by 81 per cent between 1986
and 1996 to 73,700 million vehicle-kilometres,
reflecting increases in motorway length as well
as traffic flow.
Management
Responsibility for trunk roads, including most
motorways, rests in England with the
2 That is, those motorways that are the direct responsibility of
central government rather than of the local authority.

Central government meets most of the costs of
construction and maintenance. The Highways
Agency, an executive agency of the DETR, is
responsible for building, improving and
maintaining motorways and trunk roads in
England. Its total budget is £1,685 million in
1997-98. In Northern Ireland the Roads
Service, an agency of the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland, is
responsible for the construction, improvement
and maintenance of all public roads. The main
highway authorities for non-trunk roads in
England are the county councils, the
metropolitan district councils, the new unitary
authorities (see pp. 80-1) and the London
borough councils. In Wales and Scotland, the
highway authorities are the unitary authorities.
Private sector finance has been playing a
greater role in roads under ‘Design, Build,
Finance and Operate’ (DBFO) contracts.
Under these schemes, the private sector
provides the funding for construction and
maintenance, and currently receives
government payments linked to usage and
performance. There are eight DBFO projects
in operation. Among other schemes in which
the private sector has been involved, with tolls
payable by users, are a bridge between the
mainland of Scotland and Skye, and the
second crossing of the River Severn. One of
the inputs to the review of transport policy
will be analysis of the trials of electronic
tolling equipment recently conducted at the
I ransport Research Laboratory.
Road Programme
In summer 1997, 22 motorway and trunk road
schemes were under construction in England
and 142 further schemes were in preparation.
A major review of the road programme was
announced in June 1997 and is expected to be
completed in spring 1998. The objective is to
determine the role of roads in the
Government’s integrated transport policy, and
to establish a new investment programme for
the motorway and trunk road network. Among
the issues being examined are:
• the environmental impact of roads;
• whether steps should be taken to manage
demand for travel by road;
• the extent to which other modes of
transport should be encouraged;
• the role of technology and improved
driver information systems; and
• the impact of investment in roads on
regional development.
Meanwhile, preparatory work on new schemes
has mostly been suspended.
Support for local authority road schemes is
increasingly approved on a package basis,
under which local authorities submit bids
covering all transport modes based on a
comprehensive transport strategy. For
1997-98 the DETR has approved 65 package
bids totalling £79 million. A total of £195
million of government grant is available to
support local authority spending on transport
in England in 1997-98.
Road communications in Wales have
benefited from the second Severn Bridge,
305
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
which opened in 1996, the completion of the
M4 motorway and improvements to the A55
and A465 roads. The A55 is now a dual
carriageway across the Welsh mainland, and
extension of the dual carriageway to Holyhead
on Anglesey is expected to be completed in
2001. The Welsh Office’s trunk road and
transport grant programme (including support
for local authority schemes) for 1997-98 will
cost over £167 million.
Planned expenditure on roads and
transport in Scotland is £282 million in
1997-98. The main priorities within the trunk
road programme are the upgrading to
motorway standard of the Glasgow to Carlisle
route, and the completion of the motorway
network in central Scotland. These routes
provide important links for commerce and
industry to the south and to mainland Europe.
There are also a series of ‘route action plans’
designed to make significant improvements to
safety and journey times on specific major
routes.
In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on
improving key strategic routes, constructing
more bypasses, and improving roads in the •
Belfast area. Planned expenditure in 1997-98
on roads by the Roads Service is £151 million.
Driver Information
With the growth in traffic, the provision of
information to drivers about road conditions
has become of greater importance. A new
driver information system has been introduced
on motorways and trunk roads between
London, Birmingham and Nottingham, with
over 70 variable message signs at major
intersections providing information about
accidents and delays, and advice about
alternative routes with less congestion. A pilot
scheme was introduced in 1995 on the south¬
west quadrant of the M25 London orbital
motorway, which is one of the busiest sections
of motorway in Europe. Signals mounted over
each lane introduce mandatory speed limits as
traffic volumes increase, and before the flow of
traffic is interrupted. The results from the
pilot scheme indicate better driver behaviour
and conditions, and a reduction in accidents.
The Highways Agency is proposing a series
of regional traffic control centres for
monitoring traffic conditions and advising
motorists of delays on the motorway and trunk
road network. They will supplement 32 local
police control offices in England and provide
control over a wider area. A new traffic control
centre in south Wales was inaugurated in
August 1997.
There are also privately operated driver
information services, which supply
subscribers with information on congestion.
In-car systems, such as Trafficmaster, now
cover motorways and many trunk roads in
Britain.
Licensing and Standards
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
(DVLA) maintains official records of drivers
and vehicles in Great Britain. At the end of
1996, it held records on 35 million drivers and
26 million licensed vehicles. Records for
Northern Ireland are maintained by Driver
and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland.
Minimum ages for driving are:
• 16 for riders of mopeds, drivers of small
tractors, and disabled people receiving a
mobility allowance;
• 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver),
motorcycles and goods vehicles not over
3.5 tonnes permissible maximum weight;
• 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5,
but not over 7.5, tonnes; and
• 21 for passenger vehicles with more than
nine seats and goods vehicles over 7.5
tonnes.
Changes in the arrangements for driver
licensing and testing took place in 1996-97.
New drivers of motor vehicles must now pass
both the practical driving test and a new
separate written theory test in order to acquire
a full driving licence. The Driving Standards
Agency is the national driver testing authority
in Great Britain. It also supervises professional
driving instructors and the compulsory basic
training scheme for learner motorcyclists.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles are
allowed on the roads, they must meet safety
and environmental requirements, based
306
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
primarily on standards drawn up by the
European Union (EU). The Vehicle
Certification Agency is responsible for
ensuring these requirements are met through a
process known as ‘type approval’. It also
provides a service to manufacturers wishing to
obtain international vehicle system and
component type approval in Great Britain.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles. It
does this through the annual testing of
vehicles, including heavy goods vehicles, light
goods vehicles, public service vehicles, cars
and motorcycles. It also uses roadside and
other enforcement checks to ensure that
drivers and vehicle operators comply with
legislation.
In Northern Ireland the Driver and Vehicle
Testing Agency (DVTA) is responsible for
testing drivers and vehicles under statutory
schemes broadly similar to those in Great
Britain. Private cars four or more years old are
tested at DVT A centres.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the highest
densities of road traffic in the world, it has a
good record on road safety, with the lowest
road accident death rate for adults in the EU.
In 1996, 3,598 deaths occurred in road
accidents in Great Britain, the lowest annual
figure since records began in 1926. Serious
injuries, at 44,500, were also down on the
previous year and represented the lowest level
since 1948. However, there has recently been a
rise in the number of slight injuries, to 272,200
in 1996.
Since 1981-85 total casualties have fallen by
1 per cent, to 320,300, in a period when traffic
has increased by 50 per cent. Several factors,
such as developments in vehicle safety
standards, improvements in roads, and the
introduction of legislation on seat-belt wearing,
have contributed to the long-term decline in
deaths and serious casualties.
Among road safety measures priority is
given to reducing casualties among vulnerable
road-users (children, pedestrians, cyclists,
motorcyclists and elderly people), particularly
in urban areas, where about 75 per cent of road
accidents occur. Action includes measures to
combat speeding, improvements in highway
design, better protection for vehicle occupants
and encouraging the use of cycle helmets.
Some £60 million has been allocated for
spending on local road safety schemes in
England in 1997-98. Gloucester has been
chosen in a competition as the site of the first
‘Safe Town’ initiative. It is receiving £5
million over five years to implement a co¬
ordinated package of road safety measures.
Traffic-calming measures, such as road
humps, have been introduced in many towns
and cities to improve both safety and the
environment. Local authorities can introduce
20 mph (32 km/h) zones with traffic-calming
features, with central government consent,
and over 300 have been authorised.
Monitoring has shown that these zones can
reduce accident casualties substantially; for
example, child pedestrian and cyclist
casualties have fallen by 67 per cent.

Traffic management schemes are used in many
urban areas to reduce congestion, create a better
environment and improve road safety. They
include bus lanes, facilities for pedestrians and
cyclists, and traffic-calming measures.
A 505-km (315-mile) network of priority
‘red routes’ for better traffic flow is being
introduced in London. Marked by special
signs and red lines at the kerb, these routes are
subject to special stopping controls and other
traffic management measures, strictly enforced
with penalties higher than elsewhere. The
network is expected to be fully operational by
the year 2000.
Many towns have shopping precincts
designed for the convenience of pedestrians,
from which motor vehicles are excluded for all
or part of the day. Controls over on-street
parking are enforced through excess charges
and fixed penalty fines, supported by powers
to clamp or remove vehicles.
Travel to Work
Commuting is the most important single
purpose for travel, in terms of distance
307
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
travelled. Many commuting journeys by car
are into city centres or other urban areas. The
Government is encouraging employers to find
ways of reducing the impact on traffic
congestion and on the environment of their
employees’ travel patterns, especially their
commuting journeys. It is supporting
companies, such as Boots and BAA, which
have developed company travel plans to
encourage fewer staff to travel to work by car
and more to use other modes such as public
transport, cycling or walking, or to use car¬
sharing arrangements.
Cycling and Walking
A National Cycling Strategy, launched in
1996, is encouraging greater use of cycles and
aims to double the number of cycling journeys
by 2002. The National Cycling Forum is co¬
ordinating its implementation. Local
authorities are being encouraged to give
greater priority to cycling and to improve
conditions for cyclists by, for example,
providing designated cycle routes. Under the
Cycle Challenge Project, around 60 projects
have been promoted, many of which are
designed to make cycling to work easier. The
Government is also supporting the National
Cycle Network now being developed which is
intended to open up new opportunities for
commuter, tourist and recreational cycling.
The Millennium Commission is providing
significant financial support for the network,
which aims to create some 6,500 miles (10,400
kilometres) of routes for cyclists by 2005. A
Walking Steering Group within the DETR is
developing a strategy to promote walking as a
mode of transport.
ROAD HAULAGE
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles
amounted to 147,000 million tonne-kilometres
in Great Britain in 1996, 2 per cent more than
in 1995. There has been a move towards larger
and more efficient vehicles carrying heavier
loads-—over 80 per cent of the traffic, in terms
of tonne-kilometres, is now carried by vehicles
of over 25 tonnes gross weight. Journey
lengths are increasing, with the average haul
now being 90 kilometres (56 miles), 32 per
cent longer than in 1980. Hauliers licensed to
transport other firms’ goods account for 74
per cent of freight carried in terms of tonne-
kilometres.
There are about 14,600 holders of an
operator’s licence, and 109,300 large goods
vehicles. Nearly 90 per cent of operators have
fleets of five or fewer vehicles. The biggest in
Great Britain are NFC pic, P & O Industrial
Services Division, Ocean Group pic and
Tibbet & Britten Group pic.
Licensing and Other Controls
In general, those operating goods vehicles or
trailer combinations over 3.5 tonnes gross
weight require a goods vehicle operator’s
licence. Licences are divided into restricted
licences for own-account operators carrying
goods connected with their own business, and
standard licences for hauliers operating for hire
or reward. Proof of professional competence,
financial standing and good repute is needed to
obtain a standard licence. In Northern Ireland
own-account operators do not require a licence,
although this is under consideration.
EC regulations prescribe maximum limits
on driving times and minimum requirements
for breaks and rest periods for most drivers of
heavy goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. Drivers’
activities are monitored automatically by a
tachograph—a recording device in the cab.
Lorry Weights
The current general maximum lorry weight in
Britain is 38 tonnes for goods vehicles with
five or more axles. However, it is 44 tonnes for
certain six-axle vehicles engaged in combined
road/rail operations, as an incentive to
encourage rail freight, A review of the general
maximum weight has been undertaken.
International Road Haulage
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1996 about 1.64 million road goods
vehicles were ferried to mainland Europe, of
which 531,000 were powered vehicles
registered in Britain. In 1996 British vehicles
308
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
carried 15.1 million tonnes internationally,
and about 95 per cent of this traffic was with
the European Union. The largest commodity
group carried is agricultural produce and
foodstuffs, which accounted for 31 per cent of
inward tonnage and 23 per cent of outward
tonnage in 1996.
International road haulage within the EU is
fully liberalised. ‘Cabotage’ (the operation of
domestic road haulage within a member state
by a non-resident) will be fully liberalised in
1998. Haulage elsewhere takes place under
bilateral agreements.
ROAD PASSENGER SERVICES
Buses
Usage of local bus services has shown a long¬
term decline. In 1995-96 some 4,383 million
passenger journeys were made on local bus
services in Great Britain, 22 per cent fewer
than in 1985-86. This has contrasted with an
increase in local bus services in terms of bus
mileage operated since the industry was
deregulated in 1985.
The Government is conducting a review of
all aspects of bus services, with the aim of
stimulating greater use of buses as a way of
reducing congestion and pollution. The review
is examining the scope for more effective use of
bus priority measures (see below), better
arrangements for passenger information and
ticketing, and regulatory and other measures to
improve the quality of bus services. For
example, the Government is supporting the
concept of partnerships between local
authorities and bus operators as part of the
development of an integrated transport system.
Operators
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by private sector bus operators, apart
from 17 bus companies run by local
authorities. London Transport (LT), a
statutory corporation, is responsible for
providing public transport in London. It
oversees about 700 bus routes run by private
sector companies under contract.
A series of mergers and takeovers has taken
place, so that there are now five main groups
There has been renewed interest in
reviving local public transport services. As
well as several tram or light rail
developments (see pp. 313-14), trials of
‘guided buses’, whereby buses follow guide
wires under the road or overhead, are
taking place in Leeds and Ipswich.
operating bus services: Cowie Group,
FirstBus, Go-Ahead Group, National Express
and Stagecoach. These are now substantial
undertakings—for example, FirstBus has over
20 separate bus operations, with a fleet of
8,800 buses and more than 22,000 staff. All
the main groups except Cowie Group are
involved in running rail services (see p. 311),
while some of the companies have expanded
into bus services in other countries.
Services
Most local bus services are provided
commercially, with 85 per cent of bus mileage
outside London operated on a commercial
basis. Local authorities may subsidise services
which are not commercially viable but are
considered to be socially necessary. Outside
London, operators may provide services
without restriction. Local bus services have to
be registered with the relevant traffic
commissioner. Controls may be imposed on
the number of vehicles operating if this would
cause congestion or danger to other road users.
Bus priority measures, such as bus lanes
and traffic light priority signalling, are being
increasingly adopted in order to make bus
services quicker and more reliable. They form
an important element in many local
authorities’ package bids (see p. 305) to the
DETR. In London the DETR and local
authorities are developing an 800-km (500-
mile) bus priority network covering all heavily
used bus routes in London. The network is
receiving support of £9 million in 1997-98.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland subsidiaries of the
publicly owned Northern Ireland Transport
309
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Holding Company supply almost all road
passenger services. Citybus Ltd operates
services in Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd runs
most of the services in the rest of Northern
Ireland. These companies have about 270 and
1,220 vehicles, handling respectively 24
million and 54 million passenger journeys a
year. There are also over 90 small privately
owned undertakings, often operating fewer
than five vehicles.
Coaches
In Britain long-distance coach services are
provided by private sector companies. The
biggest operator, National Express, has a
national network of routes. It carried some 14
million passengers on its coach services in
Britain in 1996. Coaches and minibuses
carrying three or more children now have to be
fitted with seatbelts on all seats. Agreement has
been reached within the EU on fitting seatbelts
to new coaches and minibuses. The EC
directive takes effect over a four-year period to
October 2001.
While all regular, and some shuttle,
overseas coach services still require
authorisation or permission from the
authorities of the countries to or through
which they travel, most tourist services within
the EU have been liberalised. Operators no
longer need prior permission to run either
holiday shuttle services, where accommodation
is included as part of the package, or occasional
coach tours to, from or within another member
state.
Taxis
There are about 52,000 licensed taxis in
England and Wales, mainly in urban areas;
London has around 18,700. In London and
several other major cities, taxis must be
purpose-built to conform to strict
requirements and new ones must be able to
carry people in wheelchairs. In many urban
districts, drivers must have passed a test of
their knowledge of the area. At present, a local
authority outside London can only limit the
number of licensed taxis if it is satisfied that
there is no unfulfilled demand for taxis in its
area. Private hire vehicles with drivers
(‘minicabs’) may be booked only through the
operator and not hired on the street. In most
areas outside London, private hire vehicles are
licensed; there are about 56,000 in England
and Wales outside London. It is estimated that
at least 40,000 minicabs operate in London. A
licensing system for minicabs in London is
planned. There are about 4,000 licensed taxis
in Northern Ireland. Licences are issued by
the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland on a broadly similar basis to
that in Great Britain.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
1825, was the first public passenger railway in
the world to be worked by steam power. The
main railway services in Great Britain are now
provided by private sector companies.
Privatisation, involving the sale of around 100
railway operations run by the former British
Rail, was completed in 1997. The main system
now involves:
• Railtrack, which is responsible for
operating all track and infrastructure;
• three rolling stock companies, which
lease locomotives and passenger
carriages;
• 25 train operating companies, which run
passenger rail services under franchise;
• four freight service providers;
• seven infrastructure maintenance
companies; and
• six track renewal companies.
Rail Regulation
There are two main bodies involved in
overseeing rail services:
• the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising
(OPRAF), headed by the Franchising
Director; and
• the Office of the Rail Regulator.
OPRAF is responsible for negotiating,
awarding and monitoring the franchises for
310
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
operating rail services. Each franchise
agreement specifies provisions governing the
contractual level of passenger services to be
provided by the operator. The Passenger
Service Requirement sets out, for each route,
the minimum service level which operators are
required to meet covering, among other
things, the frequency of trains, stations served,
first and last trains, and the provision of
sufficient peak train capacity.
The Government is continuing to support
socially necessary rail passenger services
through grants paid to franchisees and these
are administered by OPRAF. Support for
passenger rail services in 1996-97 amounted
to £1,843 million. In general, the franchise
arrangements provide for gradually reducing
subsidies to the franchisees.
The functions of the Office of the Rail
Regulator include licensing the new railway
operators, dealing with agreements governing
access by operators to track and stations, and
promoting and protecting rail users’ interests.
It sponsors a network of statutory rail users’
consultative committees which represent the
interests of passengers.
Railtrack
Railtrack owns and manages the rail
infrastructure in Great Britain, including
railway track, signalling, bridges, tunnels,
stations and depots. Its assets include 32,000
kilometres (20,000 miles) of track, providing a
route network of over 16,000 kilometres
(10,000 miles), 40,000 bridges, tunnels and
viaducts, 2,500 stations and connections to
over 1,000 freight terminals. Apart from 14
major stations operated directly by the
company, nearly all stations and depots are
leased to the train operating companies.
Turnover in 1996-97 totalled £2,437 million,
of which 94 per cent represented payments by
passenger and freight train operators for
access to the rail network.
Railtrack is planning to spend over £10,000
million on renewing and maintaining the rail
network in the period from 1995 to 2001.
Major projects include:
• £1,350 million on the West Coast Main
Line route modernisation programme to
Following privatisation, a number of rail
services have improved, but problems have
arisen in some areas as a result of cancelled
trains, trains with fewer carriages and
consequent passenger overcrowding, and
difficulties over ticketing arrangements.
The Government believes that the powers
available to the rail regulators may be
inadequate. It is therefore seeking to
improve public accountability of the railway
system and to strengthen rail regulation.
This would be achieved through the
creation of a Strategic Rail Authority. The
Government is undertaking a wide-ranging
review of rail regulation to determine,
among other things, how the new Authority
would operate.
enable better services to be provided
between London, the West Midlands,
the North West and western Scotland,
and a further £150 million to
accommodate new high-speed tilting
trains planned by Virgin, the train
operator on this route (see below); and
• £580 million on Thameslink 2000, which
will significantly improve the capacity of
north-south services through London.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local stopping services; and commuter
services in and around the large conurbations,
especially London and south-east England.
Some 776 million passenger journeys were
made on the rail network in 1996-97. About
30 per cent of route-mileage is electrified.
Passenger services (other than Eurostar
services) are run under franchise by 25 train
operating companies. Franchises range from
large-scale operations covering a wide area
(such as the West Coast Main Line) to the
smallest franchise, covering services on the
Isle of Wight. A variety of operators have
obtained franchises. Bus and coach operator
National Express has the largest number of
franchises—five. Other main operators

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The Heathrow Express rail link will start
on a limited basis in autumn 1997 and be
fully operational in June 1998. Under the
£440 million project, run by BAA, trains
will operate between Heathrow Airport
and Paddington, while a service from
Heathrow to St Pancras is due to start in
1999.
include Connex (which is French-owned and
has two franchises running commuter services
in the South East), Virgin, Prism and
Stagecoach. The companies hire their rolling
stock from the three rolling stock companies:
Angel Train Contracts, Eversholt Leasing and
Porterbrook Leasing (now a subsidiary of
Stagecoach).
Most franchises last seven years, but some
are for 15 years on condition that the
franchisee provides new rolling stock. For
example, National Express is to introduce
completely new rolling stock on its Gatwick
Express service from London (Victoria) to
Gatwick Airport by 1999. The train operating
companies have agreed to invest an estimated
£1,500 million in new and refurbished trains.
Several orders have recently been placed for
new trains, including a £200 million order for
44 trains for the London, Tilbury and
Southend service. Virgin Rail Group is
planning to introduce a fleet of 40 high-speed
tilting trains on the West Coast Main Line for
delivery from 2001 onwards, and is to order
new high-speed diesel trains for its cross¬
country routes.
Freight
Over 80 per cent of rail freight traffic by
volume is of bulk commodities, mainly coal,
coke, iron and steel, building materials and
petroleum. The largest operator is English,
Welsh & Scottish Railway (EWS). Since it
acquired most of British Rail’s freight
businesses in 1995—96, EWS has won new
traffic to rail, serving sites which have not had
rail freight for many years. Freightliner
operates container services between major
ports and inland terminals. New freight
operators have had rights of open access to the
rail network since 1994.
Government grants are available to
encourage companies to move goods by rail or
water rather than road. Since 1975 over 200
grants have been made, and it is estimated that
some 3 million lorry journeys a year have been
removed from the roads. The DETR budget
for such grants in 1997—98 is about £30
million.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland
Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary of the
Northern Ireland Transport Holding
Company, operates the railway service on
about 336 kilometres (211 miles) of track and
handled over 6 million passenger journeys in
1996-97. The Belfast to Dublin service is
being upgraded with new rolling stock, and an
improved service was introduced in 1997.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel, the largest civil
engineering project in Europe to be financed
by the. private sector, was opened to traffic in
1994. The project, which is estimated to have
cost about £10,000 million, was undertaken by
Eurotunnel, a British-French group, under a
65-year operating concession from the British
and French governments.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel operates shuttle trains through
twin one-way rail tunnels between the
terminals near Folkestone and Calais, with the
journey taking about 35 minutes. These trains
provide a drive-on, drive-off service, with
separate shuttle trains for passenger and freight
vehicles. Eurotunnel runs passenger shuttle
services every 15 minutes and freight shuttle
services every 20 minutes at peak periods. The
service has taken about 40 per cent of the
market for tourist vehicles making the crossing
between Kent and northern France. Services
were disrupted following a fire on a freight
shuttle train in November 1996, but by June
1997 had been fully restored.
312
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Eurostar Passenger Services
Up to 28 Eurostar high-speed train services
run daily in each direction through the
Channel Tunnel between London (Waterloo)
and Paris or Brussels, taking less than 3 hours
and 3 hours 10 minutes respectively. The
London-Brussels journey will be cut to 2
hours 40 minutes when a new high-speed line
in Belgium is opened; this is expected in early
1998. Eurostar services are operated by
Eurostar (UK) Ltd—owned by London &
Continental Railways (LCR)—French
Railways and Belgian Railways. Passenger
numbers are growing rapidly—nearly 5 million
passengers travelled on Eurostar in 1996.
LCR is responsible for the design and
construction of the £3,000 million Channel
Tunnel Rail Link, a 108-km (67-mile) high¬
speed railway between London and the
Channel Tunnel. Its London terminal will be
at St Pancras, with intermediate stations at
Stratford in east London, and Ebbsfleet and
Ashford in Kent. Construction is expected to
begin in 1998 and to be completed in 2003.
When the new line is in operation, journey
times for the London-Paris and London-
Brussels services will be cut to 2 hours 20
minutes and 2 hours respectively.
Channel Tunnel Rail Freight
EWS is expected to acquire British Rail’s
Channel Tunnel freight business, Railfreight
Distribution (RfD), later in 1997. RfD
operates over 150 trains a week between
Britain and the continent of Europe. It serves
terminals at Willesden (London), Wakefield,
Manchester, Mossend (near Glasgow),
Daventry (Northamptonshire) and Hams Hall
(Birmingham), and several terminals for
automotive traffic. All these terminal facilities
allow freight to be transferred easily between
road and rail.
Other Railways in London
London Underground Ltd (LUL), a
subsidiary of LT, operates services on 391
kilometres (242 miles) of railway, of which
about 171 kilometres (106 miles) are
underground. The system, the oldest in the
world, has 267 stations, with 477 trains
running in the peak period. About 772 million
passenger journeys were made on London
Underground trains in 1996-97.
The main investment project in the
Underground is the extension of the Jubilee
Line to Stratford (east London) via Docklands
and the north Greenwich peninsula. London
Underground aims to open the extension in
September 1998. Other projects include a
Private Finance Initiative project (see p. 160)
for 106 new trains for the Northern Line, the
first of which is due to enter service in autumn
1997. Nevertheless, cutbacks in investment
have led to problems in maintaining the
system. The Government is now looking at a
range of public-private partnerships with the
aim of bringing in substantial investment to
modernise the Underground.
The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), a 22-
km (14-mile) system with 28 stations, connects
Docklands with the City of London, Beckton
and Stratford. The railway is operated by
Docklands Railway Management Ltd, owned
jointly by Serco Group pic and a team of DLR
managers, under a seven-year franchise from
April 1997. The company will also operate an
extension of the DLR under the River Thames
to Greenwich and Lewisham, which is due to
open in 1999-2000.
Construction has begun on the Croydon
Tramlink, a 28-km (18-mile) light rail network
which will connect Croydon with Wimbledon,
Beckenham and New Addington and run
partly along existing and disused railway track
and partly along or beside roads. It is a joint
project between LT and a private sector
consortium, Tramtrack Croydon Ltd, which
will build, operate and maintain the network.
The project will cost £200 million, of which
the DETR is providing a grant of £125
million, and is expected to open in late 1999.
Other Railways
The Glasgow Underground, a heavy rapid
transit system, operates on a 10-km (6-mile)
loop in central Glasgow. There has been
growing interest in recent years in the
development of light rail systems or the
reintroduction of trams—traditional trams
still operate in Blackpool and Llandudno. The
313
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Tyne and Wear Metro is a 59-km (37-mile)
light rail system connecting Newcastle upon
Tyne with Gateshead, North and South
Shields, Heworth and Jarrow. The Greater
Manchester Metrolink connects Altrincham
and Bury with Manchester city centre on a
31-km (19-mile) route. Various extensions to
the Metrolink are planned, including a £144
million link to Manchester Airport. The
South Yorkshire Supertram, a 29-km
(18-mile) system, connects Meadowhall,
Hillsborough and Halfway to Sheffield City
Centre.
Construction work has started on Midland
Metro Line One in Birmingham, which is
expected to commence operation in summer
1998. Other approved schemes include the
Leeds Supertram and the Greater Nottingham
Light Rapid Transit.
Over 100 other passenger-carrying
railways, many concerned with the
preservation of steam locomotives, are to be
found throughout Great Britain. Most are
operated on a voluntary basis and provide
limited services for tourists and railway
enthusiasts. They generally run on former
branch lines, but there are also several narrow-
gauge lines, mainly in north Wales.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are popular for leisure and
recreation and make a valuable contribution to
the quality of Britain’s environment. They
also play a significant role in land drainage and
water supply, and some are used for carrying
freight. The greatest amounts of seagoing
freight are carried on the Rivers Thames,
Forth, Humber and Mersey and the
Manchester Ship Canal. The most important
waterways for internal traffic are the Thames,
the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Mersey
and the Manchester Ship Canal.
British Waterways is responsible for 3,200
kilometres (2,000 miles) of waterways in Great
Britain, making up the greater part of the
canal system. The majority of its waterways
are primarily for leisure use, but about 620
kilometres (385 miles) are maintained as
commercial waterways. In 1996-97 British
Waterways’ revenue amounted to £98.7
million, including a government grant of
£51.8 million to maintain its waterways to
statutory standards.
SHIPPING
The British merchant fleet has declined
considerably in recent years. During 1996 the
number of British-owned merchant trading
ships of 100 gross tonnes or more fell from 675
to 638. Their total tonnage was 11.6 million
deadweight tonnes. Among the ships were 155
vessels totalling 5.5 million deadweight tonnes
used as oil, chemical or gas carriers and 450
vessels totalling 6.0 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry-bulk carriers, container ships
or other types of cargo ship. In all, 73 per cent
of British-owned vessels are registered in
Britain or British Dependent Territories such
as Bermuda. -
The Government is considering, in
consultation with shipping interests, ways of
reviving the sector and developing its
economic potential. Britain plays a significant
role in the formulation of shipping policy
within the EU. All international services and
most cabotage services within the EU have
been liberalised. Full cabotage liberalisation
will be achieved over the next ten years. Work
is progressing on a European programme to
improve maritime safety and prevent
pollution.
Cargo Services
Seaborne trade amounted to 354 million
tonnes in 1996, with a value of £260,900
million (see Table 19.3). About 95 per cent by
weight (75 per cent by value) of Britain’s
foreign trade is carried by sea. Tanker cargo
accounted for 40 per cent of this trade by
weight, but only 5 per cent by value.
Nearly all scheduled cargo-liner services
from Britain are containerised. British tonnage
serving these trades is dominated by a
relatively small number of private sector
companies. P & O has recently merged its
container interests with those of Nedlloyd of
the Netherlands to form the world’s largest
container operator. In deep-sea trades,
shipping companies usually operate in
conjunction with other companies on the
same routes in organisations known as

to ensure regular and efficient services with
stable freight rates, to the benefit of both
shipper and shipowner. Besides the carriage of
freight by liner and bulk services between
Britain and the rest of Europe, many roll-on
roll-off services carry cars, passengers and
commercial vehicles.
♦
Passenger Services
In 1996, 35 million international sea passenger
movements took place between Britain and the
rest of the world, compared with about 105
million international air passenger movements.
Almost all passengers who arrived at or
departed from British ports travelled to or from
the continent of Europe or the Irish Republic.
In 1996 about 233,000 people embarked on, or
landed from, pleasure cruises at British ports.
Traffic from southern and south-eastern ports
accounts for a substantial proportion of traffic
to the continent of Europe.
The main British operators are Stena
Sealink Line, P & O European Ferries and
Hoverspeed, although not all their vessels are
under the British flag. P & O and Stena have
announced their intention to merge their
services on the short-sea cross-Channel
routes. Services are provided by roll-on roll¬
off ferries, hovercraft, hydrofoils and high¬
speed catamarans. There has been a trend
towards using larger vessels, including new
large high-speed vessels, as the ferry
companies have faced growing competition
from the Channel Tunnel.
Domestic passenger and freight ferry
services also run to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, the Orkney
and Shetland islands, and the islands off the
west coast of Scotland.
Maritime Safety
The DETR currently has two executive
agencies concerned with maritime safety and
the prevention of marine pollution—the
Coastguard Agency and the Marine Safety
Agency (MSA)—which are to be merged into
a single agency from April 1998. The
Coastguard Agency is responsible for HM
Coastguard and the Marine Pollution Control
Unit (see pp. 351-2). The MSA is responsible
for marine safety and the prevention of
pollution from ships. It carries out inspections
on British and foreign ships using British
ports to ensure that they comply with
international safety, pollution prevention and
operational standards. In 1996-97, 157
overseas-registered ships were detained by the
MSA in British ports.
HM Coastguard co-ordinates civil
maritime search and rescue operations around
the coastline of Britain. In a maritime
emergency the coastguard calls on and co¬
ordinates facilities, such as:
315
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
• HM Coastguard helicopters and cliff
rescue companies;
• lifeboats of the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution (a voluntary body);
• aircraft, helicopters and ships from the
armed forces; and
• merchant shipping and commercial
aircraft.
Search and rescue incidents handled by HM
Coastguard have grown considerably in recent
years. In 1996 it co-ordinated action in nearly
11,300 incidents (including cliff rescues), in
which over 19,200 people were helped.
Some locations around Britain are hazardous
for shipping. Measures are taken to reduce the
risk of collision, including the separation of
ships into internationally agreed shipping lanes.
For example, there is a traffic separation
scheme in the Dover Strait, one of the world’s
busiest seaways. It is monitored by radar from
the Channel Navigation Information Service
near Dover.
Since the loss of the Herald of Free
Enterprise in 1987, Britain has played a key
role in securing safety improvements for roll¬
on roll-off ferries. Following the Estonia
disaster in the Baltic Sea in 1995, Britain
helped to conclude the Stockholm Agreement,
which sets higher standards for the
survivability of roll-on roll-off ferries within
north-western Europe and the Baltic, with a
phased timetable for implementation. Britain
was the first country to sign the Agreement,
and regulations applying it to roll-on roll-off
ferries operating to and from British ports
came into force in April 1997.
The lighthouse authorities, which control
about 350 lighthouses and other lights and
buoys, are:
• the Corporation of Trinity House, which
covers England, Wales and the Channel
Islands;
• the Northern Lighthouse Board, for
Scotland and the Isle of Man; and
• the Commissioners of Irish Lights for
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
They are funded mainly by light dues
levied on shipping in Britain and Ireland.
Responsibility for some lights and buoys used
for local navigation and for pilotage within
harbours rests with harbour authorities.
PORTS
There are about 80 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain. In addition,
several hundred small harbours cater for local
cargo, fishing vessels, island ferries or
recreation. There are three broad types of
port—trust ports owned and run by boards
constituted as trusts, those owned by local
authorities and company-owned ports. Most
operate with statutory powers. Major ports
controlled by trusts include Aberdeen, Dover,
Milford Haven and Tyne. Local authorities
own many small ports and a few much larger
ports, including Portsmouth and the oil ports
in Orkney and Shetland. Seven trust ports
have been privatised: Clyde, Dundee, Forth,
Ipswich, Medway, Tees and Hartlepool, and
Tilbury.
Associated British Ports (ABP), Britain’s
largest port owner, operates 23 ports,
including Cardiff, Grimsby and Immingham,
Hull, Newport, Southampton and Swansea. In
March 1997 it acquired the port of Ipswich.
Together its ports (excluding Ipswich)
handled 118 million tonnes of cargo in 1996.
Other major ports owned by private sector
companies include Felixstowe, Liverpool,
Manchester and a group of ferry ports,
including Harwich (Parkeston Quay) and
Stranraer.
Port Traffic
In 1996 traffic through major British ports
amounted to a record 513 million tonnes. This
comprised 168 million tonnes of exports, 181
million tonnes of imports and 164 million
tonnes of domestic traffic (which included
offshore traffic and landings of sea-dredged
aggregates). The smaller ports handled an
additional 38 million tonnes.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are shown in Table 19.4.
Forth, Milford Haven and Sullom Voe
(Shetland) mostly handle oil, while the
principal ports for non-fuel traffic are

Container and roll-on roll-off traffic in
Britain was 108 million tonnes in 1996 and
now accounts for 20 per cent of non-bulk
traffic. The most important ports for
container traffic are Felixstowe, Southampton
and London. Dover is Britain’s leading port
■ for roll-on roll-off traffic. It is also the major
passenger port, handling around half of
international sea passenger movements to and
from Britain.
Northern Ireland has four main ports, at
Belfast, Larne, Londonderry and
Warrenpoint. Belfast is the principal freight
port, handling 15.7 million tonnes in 1996.
Most recent major port developments have
been at east- and south-coast ports. For
example, Dover has a £100 million
programme to develop its western docks to
meet competition from the Channel Tunnel.
ABP invests about £70 million a year in
developing its port and transport facilities.
New terminals for the steel traffic are planned
at its ports at Hull, Goole and Newport, while
major developments are planned at
Immingham, Hull and Southampton.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the
British sector of the North Sea have been built
at Hound Point on the Forth, on the Tees, at
Flotta and at Sullom Voe (one of the largest oil
terminals in the world). Supply bases for
offshore oil and gas installations have been
constructed at several ports, notably
Aberdeen, Great Yarmouth, Montrose,
Dundee and Heysham.
CIVIL AVIATION
British aviation authorities are negotiating new
international rights and improving facilities
such as air traffic control. British airlines are
entirely in the private sector, as are many of
the major airports.
Air Traffic
British airlines flew a record 1,102 million
aircraft kilometres in 1996, 71 per cent higher
than in 1986: 735 million kilometres on
scheduled services and 367 million kilometres
on non-scheduled flights. They carried 51
million passengers on scheduled services and
26 million on charter flights. Passenger seat
occupancy was 78 per cent, being much higher
on charter flights (nearly 89 per cent) than on
scheduled services (73 per cent). It is also
higher for international flights (79 per cent)
than internal services (64 per cent).
Air freight is important for the carriage of
goods with a high value-to-weight ratio,
especially where speed is essential.
British Airways
British Airways is one of the world’s leading
airlines and in terms of international
scheduled services it is the largest in the
world. During 1996-97 its turnover from
airline operations was £8,359 million. The
Development
317
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
British Airways group, which employs 60,000
people worldwide, carried 38.2 million
passengers on scheduled and charter flights
both within Britain and internationally.
British Airways’ scheduled route network
serves almost 200 destinations in nearly 90
countries. Its main operating base is London’s
Heathrow Airport, with services also
operational from Gatwick and regional centres
such as Birmingham, Glasgow and
Manchester. The airline has a fleet of 309
aircraft, one of the largest in Western Europe,
including seven Concordes, 67 Boeing 747s
and eight Boeing 777s.
Other Airlines
Other major British airlines operating
internationally include:
• Air UK;
• Britannia Airways, the world’s biggest
charter airline, which carried 7.5 million
passengers in 1996 and has 28 aircraft;
• British Midland, which operates a large
network of scheduled services and has 34
aircraft;
• Monarch Airlines; and
• Virgin Atlantic, which has scheduled
services to several overseas destinations
including eight in North America,
Johannesburg, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Helicopters and Other Aerial Work
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work,
especially operations connected with Britain’s
offshore oil and gas industry. The main
offshore operators in Britain are Bond
Helicopters, British International Helicopters
and Bristow Helicopters. Light aircraft and
helicopter's are also used in other important
activities, such as charters, search and rescue
services, load-lifting, aerial surveying and
photography, and police and air ambulance
operations.
Aviation Policies
The Government’s main aviation policies are
designed to promote efficient and safe air
services within, to and from Britain; and to
advance the interests of British airlines and
passengers abroad. Day-to-day responsibility
for the regulation of civil aviation rests with
the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which
also provides air traffic control services.
The Government’s aim is to create an
innovative climate in which both new and
established airlines can compete equally to
offer services to meet the needs of consumers.
To achieve this, the Government negotiates
with other governments to replace old, highly
regulated arrangements by a new approach
providing the opportunity for fair
competition. Within the European Union, the
Government has been in the forefront in
pressing for measures to liberalise air
transport, and now attaches priority to the
elimination of state aid which distorts
competition between EU airlines.
The Government wishes to ensure that
airport capacity can be made available in
response to future demand, but in a way that
recognises, and takes reasonable account of,
the effects on the environment.
Airports
Of over 140 licensed civil aerodromes in
Britain, about one-fifth handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. In 1996
Britain’s civil airports handled a total of 137.3
million passengers (135.9 million terminal
passengers and 1.4 million in transit), and 1.7
million tonnes of freight.
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international passengers and is Britain’s most
important airport for passengers and air
freight, handling 56 million passengers
(including transit passengers) and 1 million
tonnes of freight in 1996. Gatwick is also one
of the world’s busiest international airports.
Ownership and Control
Seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted
and Southampton in southern England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in
Scotland—are owned and operated by BAA pic.
Together they handle about 71 per cent of air
passenger traffic and 81 per cent of air cargo in
Britain. BAA is the world’s largest commercial

operator of airports. It has overseas interests in
the United States and Australia, is a member of
a consortium which owns Melbourne Airport,
and is a majority shareholder in the company
running Naples Airport.
Some other airports are controlled by
companies, such as Belfast International and
Cardiff airports which are owned by TBI, and
East Midlands which is run by National
Express. A number of other airports,
including Manchester, Luton and Newcastle,
are owned by local authorities.
The CAA has responsibility for the economic
regulation of the larger airports. It has powers to
take action to remedy practices considered to be
unreasonable or unfair, in particular any abuse of
an airport’s monopoly position, and also to limit
increases in charges to airlines at certain airports.
All airports used for public transport and
training flights must be licensed by the CAA for
reasons of safety. Stringent requirements, such
as the provision of adequate fire-fighting,
medical and rescue services, have to be satisfied
before a licence is granted.
Strict security measures are in force at
Britain’s airports. Regulations require airlines
to account for, and authorise for carriage,
every item of hold baggage placed on board
international flights originating in Britain.
Airport Development
Improvement schemes are in progress at many
airports. At Heathrow, current developments
include a £20 million new baggage reclaim
hall in Terminal 1 and work in connection
with the new Heathrow Express rail link to
Central London (see p. 312). A planning
inquiry is being held into a proposed fifth
terminal at Heathrow, which could eventually
cater for 30 million passengers a year. If
approved, the terminal would probably open
in 2004. BAA is spending £50 million on
extending Edinburgh Airport, including
providing a centralised check-in hall with
greater capacity and a new international
arrivals hall.
In 1997 the Government granted planning
permission for a second runway at
Manchester Airport. The 3,050-metre
(10,000-ft) runway will be the first full-
length runway to be built in Britain for 20
years and is expected to open in 2000.
Civil Aviation Authority
The CAA is responsible for promoting high
standards of safety and service in civil aviation
while minimising the regulatory burden on the
industry. It certifies aircraft and air crews,
licenses air operators and air travel organisers,
and approves certain air fares and airport
charges. The CAA also provides civilian air
traffic control services in British airspace, the
North Atlantic and at a number of airports
319
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
through its subsidiary National Air Traffic
Services Ltd (NATS). Co-ordination with,
military air traffic control is provided by an
operating agreement between the Ministry of
Defence and NATS.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation
Services
Civil and military air traffic control over
Britain and the surrounding seas, including
much of the North Atlantic, is undertaken by
NATS, working in collaboration with military
controllers. Britain plays a major role in
European air traffic control developments by
participating in international forums. It has
supported several European initiatives,
including the establishment of a unit to
manage traffic flows throughout Europe
centrally, and a programme to harmonise and
integrate European air traffic control.
Air traffic control facilities are dealing with
the continuing growth in air traffic, while
ensuring that delays to airlines are minimised.
In 1996, only 1 per cent of flights arriving at
Heathrow and Gatwick were delayed by over
20 minutes and the average delay in Britain for
all aircraft was 2.8 minutes. Action is being
taken by NATS to develop air traffic control
capacity. All civil and military en route air
traffic control operations in Britain will be
concentrated at two sites:
• a new air traffic control centre, which is
nearly complete, at Swanwick
(Hampshire), to handle traffic over
England and Wales; and
• a new Scottish centre to be built at
Prestwick, under the Private Finance
Initiative (see p. 160), which will handle
traffic over Scotland and Northern
Ireland and will replace the existing
Prestwick centre.
Air Safety
British airlines have a good safety record. In
all but two of the 15 years to 1997, there were
no passenger fatalities in accidents involving
large commercial British-registered aircraft in
British airspace. During this period no crew or
passenger fatalities associated with British-
registered large commercial aircraft occurred
in foreign airspace.
The DETR’s Air Accidents Investigation
Branch is responsible for the investigation of
accidents and serious incidents occurring in
British airspace and for those that happen
overseas to aircraft registered or manufactured
in Britain. In 1996 it investigated 362
accidents and serious incidents in Britain, and
participated in 29 accident investigations
overseas.
Every company operating aircraft used for
commercial air transport purposes must
possess an Air Operator’s Certificate, which
the CAA grants when it is satisfied that the
company is competent to operate its aircraft
safely. The CAA’s flight operations
inspectors, who are experienced civilian pilots,
together with airworthiness surveyors, check
that satisfactory standards are maintained. All
aircraft registered in Britain must be granted a
certificate of airworthiness by the CAA before
being flown. In fulfilling its responsibilities,
the CAA works closely with the Joint Aviation
Authorities, a European grouping of aviation
safety regulation authorities.
Each member of the flight crew of a
British-registered aircraft, every ground
engineer who certifies an aircraft fit to fly, and
every air traffic controller must hold the
appropriate licence issued by the CAA. To
qualify for a first professional licence, a pilot
must undertake a full-time course of
instruction approved by the CAA—or have
acceptable military or civilian flying
experience—and pass ground examinations
and flight tests.
To help safeguard aircraft against terrorist
attacks, the Government is funding research,
due to be completed during 1997, into ways of
strengthening aircraft to withstand explosions.
Communications
Telecommunications is one of the most
rapidly expanding sectors of the British
economy. As well as basic telecommunications
services, there has been growth in new
services, such as services provided over the

' TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Britain was one of the first countries to
I introduce competition in its
| telecommunications network. It has one of the
) world’s most open telecommunications
s markets, with over 200 licences issued to more
than 150 different providers. In late 1996 the
market for international services was opened
up, with the granting of over 50 licences.
Within the EU, full liberalisation of
telecommunications services and networks
across most markets will take effect on
1 January 1998.
Effective competition exists in most larger
urban areas of Britain, especially in
i! commercial centres such as the City of
London, as new fixed link operators have
extended their networks. International calls
have also been opened up to competition as
new operators offer services over leased lines.
This has resulted in improved choice for
users, with lower prices, greater choice of
supplier, and lower levels of call failure.
Investment is running at around £6,000
million a year.
Negotiations in the World Trade
Organisation (see p. 206) on trade in basic
telecommunications services were
concluded in February 1997. The
agreement, covering 69 countries
responsible for 92 per cent of the world
market, is expected to facilitate further
expansion of the rapidly growing world
telecommunications market—now worth
some US$600,000 million a year—and to
lead to substantial opportunities for British
operators and suppliers.
I Office of Telecommunications
OFTEL, a non-ministerial government
department, is the independent regulatory body
for the telecommunications industry. It is
headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, whose functions include:
• ensuring that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• promoting effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• providing advice to the President of the
Board of Trade on telecommunications
matters; and
• investigating complaints against public
telecommunications operators.
Rapid developments in the
telecommunications sector are changing the
emphasis of OFTEL’s work. It is moving
away from detailed regulation in basic
domestic telecommunications services and
looking to ensure that competition applies in
international and mobile services, and to
consider the effects of the convergence of the
telecommunications and broadcasting sectors.
BT
BT, which has been a private sector company
since 1984, is Britain’s biggest
telecommunications company, running one of
the world’s largest public telecommunications
networks, including:
• over 20 million residential lines;
• 7 million business customer connections;
• 7,500 local telephone exchanges and 69
main switching units;
• over 136,000 public payphones; and
• a wide range of specialised voice, data,
text and visual services.
BT handles an average of 103 million local,
national and international telephone calls a
day. International direct dialling is available
from Britain to more than 230 countries,
representing 99 per cent of the world’s
telephones.
BT has invested over £27,000 million since
1984 in the modernisation and expansion of its
network, to meet increasing demand and to
introduce specialised services. The company
has over 2 million kilometres of optical fibre
laid in its network in Britain. Modern digital
exchanges now serve a large majority of BT’s
customers. The combination of digital
exchange switching and digital transmission
321
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
techniques, using optical fibre cable and
microwave radio links, is improving the
quality of telephone services substantially. It
also makes possible the provision of a wider
range of services through the Company’s main
network.
BT ’s services include:
• a free facility for emergency calls to the
police, fire, ambulance, coastguard,
lifeboat and air-sea rescue services;
• directory enquiries;
• public payphone services;
• various chargeable operator-connected
services, such as reversed-charge
(‘collect’) calls;
• an operator-handled ‘Freefone’ service
and automatic Freefone and ‘Lo-calP
facilities that enable callers to contact
organisations anywhere in Britain, either
free or at local call rates;
• premium-rate services which allow
callers to obtain information from
independent providers; and
• select network services such as caller
display, reminder calls, three-way calling,
call waiting and call diversion, which are
available to customers on digital exchanges.
BT has also been developing its Internet
and other multimedia activities, for example,
as an Internet service provider. Its ‘Campus’
facilities cater for education and training
needs, while trials of many healthcare
activities, such as remote foetal scanning, have
taken place over BT’s network. It is
participating with BSkyB, Midland Bank and
Matsushita in British Interactive
Broadcasting, which has been set up to offer
interactive services, such as home shopping, to
television viewers.
BT is the second largest shareholder in the
International Telecommunications Satellite
Organisation (INTELSAT), of which 141
countries are members, and a major investor
in the European Telecommunications Satellite
Organisation (EUTELSAT). It is also the
second largest shareholder in the International
Maritime Satellite Organisation
(INMARSAT), and has interests in several
other consortia.
BT operates satellite earth stations in
London Docklands and at Goonhilly Downs
(Cornwall), Madley (near Hereford),
Aberdeen, and Mormond Hill (Grampian).
In-flight operator-controlled telephone call
facilities for air passengers are provided via
Portishead radio station near Bristol. Digital
transmission techniques have been introduced
for services to the United States, Japan, Hong
Kong and Australia via the Madley and
Goonhilly stations.
Cable & Wireless
Cable & Wireless pic supplies a wide range of
telecommunications services in over 50
countries. Its main business is the provision
and operation of public telecommunications
services in more than 30 countries and
territories, under franchises and licences
granted by the governments concerned. Over
one-third of its turnover of £7,000 million in
1996-97 came from its interests in Hong
Kong. In June 1997 the company reached
agreement to reduce its majority stakeholding
in Hong Kong Telecom. Eventually, it will
have an equal stake with China Telecom in
Hong Kong Telecom, and in return will
participate in a new venture allowing access to
the telecommunications market in China.
Cable & Wireless also supplies and manages
telecommunications services and facilities for
public and private sector customers, and
undertakes consultancy work worldwide. Its
fleet of cableships and submersible vehicle
systems for laying and maintaining submarine
cables is the largest in the world.
Cable & Wireless Communications
A major change in the telecommunications
sector in Britain took place in October 1996
with the formation of Cable & Wireless
Communications pic from the merger of Bell
Cablemedia, Mercury Communications,
NYNEX CableComms and Videotron. It is
the largest integrated supplier in Britain of
telecommunications, information and
entertainment services, and is the operating
arm of Cable & Wireless pic.
Cable & Wireless Communications has
around 10 per cent of the telecommunications
322
market in Britain, and serves about 1.1 million
private telephone customers and 80,000
businesses. It is offering local, national and
international telecommunications services,
including data, television and Internet
services, and is planning to develop interactive
multimedia services.
Other Operators
Other public telecommunications operators
include:
• COLT, which focuses on business
customers in the Greater London area;
• Energis, which is using the electricity
infrastructure as a platform for installing
new optical fibre networks;
• lonica, which in 1996 launched a service
using radio to provide the final
connection to customers, initially in East
Anglia;
• Kingston Communications, the long-
established network operator for the
Kingston upon Hull area in Yorkshire;
• Sprint, a major long-distance telephone
company in the United States, which is
seeking to expand its domestic and
international services in Britain; and
• Vodafone, the biggest mobile operator,
which also has a licence for fixed services.
Nearly all of the 134 local cable television
franchises in operation also offer voice
telephony services. By April 1997 cable
operators had installed nearly 2.5 million
telephone lines in Britain, and over 9 million
homes were able to receive broadband cable
services.
Mobile Communications
There are now over 7 million mobile
telephone users in Britain, one of the most
extensive networks in the world. Vodafone
and Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio
(Cellnet) are the two largest operators,
running competing national cellular radio
systems. They have 3 million and 2.8 million
subscribers respectively.
Britain was the first country to offer
personal communications network (PCN)
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
services, which are intended to allow the same
telephone to be used at home, at work and as a
portable within the network’s coverage. There
are two PCN operators: Orange (controlled by
Hutchison Whampoa), with around 1.1
million customers, and One-2-One (owned by
Cable & Wireless and Cable West), with some
800,000 subscribers.
National Band Three Ltd is licensed to
offer a nationwide trunked radio service, while
33 licences have been awarded for London and
regional services. National Band Three and
Tetra Link have been licensed to offer
significantly enhanced digital radio services to
companies. Other licences awarded include
four to operate mobile data networks, four to
run nationwide paging networks, three to run
national digital broadband services and two to
serve remote rural areas.
In July 1997 the Government issued a
consultation document about the
arrangements for licensing the third
generation of mobile telephones, which will
provide high-speed access to a large number of
entertainment and information services.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail. Royal Mail delivers to 26
million addresses in Britain, handling over 72
million letters each working day. This comes
to around 18,000 million items a year, while
Parcelforce handles over 140 million items.
Mail is collected from over 120,000 sites,
including posting boxes, post offices and large
postal users.
The Government is reviewing options for
giving the Post Office greater commercial
freedom. It wants the Post Office to be able to
take advantage of new opportunities and reach
its full potential, both within Britain and
internationally, while ensuring fair
competition with the private sector.
Royal Mail has invested substantially in
the latest mail-sorting technology, and
mechanisation has been introduced at all
stages of the sorting process. New high-speed
mail-handling machinery—the Integrated
Mail Processor—was introduced in 1997 and
323
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
should enable automatic handling of 90 per
cent of letter mail by 2000. Automatic sorting
utilises the information contained in the
postcode; the British postcode system is one
of the most sophisticated in the world,
allowing mechanised sorting down to part of a
street on a postman’s round and, in some
cases, to an individual address. Royal Mail
has recently invested £150 million in new
high-speed mail trains, with eight terminals,
including a new road-rail interchange in north
London.
Royal Mail International dispatches 805
million items a year. It has its own mail-
handling centre at Heathrow, which handles
about four-fifths of outward airmail. It uses
1,400 flights a week to send mail direct to
over 300 destinations worldwide.
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions; it acts as an agent for
Royal Mail and Parcelforce, government
departments, local authorities and Alliance &
Leicester Giro banking services. Several new
services have been developed, such as
bureaux de change. There are just over
19,300 post offices, of which around 600 are
operated directly by the Post Office. The
remainder are franchise offices or are
operated on an agency basis by sub¬
postmasters.

Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office offers a variety of specialist
services. Parcelforce ‘Datapost’, a door-to-door
delivery service, provides overnight delivery
throughout Britain and an international service
to 140 countries. ‘Datapost Sameday’ provides
a rapid delivery within or between major cities
in Britain. The Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh
is an important outlet for the Post Office’s
philatelic (postage stamp) business, including
sales to overseas collectors or dealers. The
British Postal Consultancy Service offers advice
and assistance on all aspects of postal business
to overseas postal administrations, and over 50
countries have used its services since 1965.
Private Courier and Express Service
Operators
Private sector couriers and express operators
are allowed to handle time-sensitive door-to-
door deliveries, subject to a minimum fee of
£1. The courier/express service industry has
grown rapidly and the revenue earned by the
carriage of these items is estimated at over
£3,000 million a year. Britain is one of the main
providers of monitored express deliveries in
Europe, with London an important centre for
air courier/express traffic.

Britain has a long tradition of research and innovation in science, engineering
and technology in universities, research institutes and industry. With just 1 per
cent of the world’s population, it carries out more than 5 per cent of global
research and development (R & D). British-based scientists are second only to
those of the United States in the production of published papers and
achievement of citations. They have won more Nobel Prizes for science—over
70—than any country except the United States. The most recent British
winners are Professor Sir Harold Kroto of Sussex University, who shared the
1996 chemistry prize with two US scientists for discovering the fullerene
molecule; Professor James Mirrlees, who shared the economics prize with
William Vickery of Canada; and John Walker of the Medical Research Council’s
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, who shared the 1997 chemistry prize with
Jens Skou of Denmark and Paul Boyer of the USA.
Innovation—the successful exploitation of
new ideas—is vital to the health of the
economy. Many of these new ideas stem
from R & D. Hence Government policy
seeks to re-invigorate the science and
engineering base (see p. 328) and to
maintain Britain’s international position of
scientific excellence, so as to maximise the
contribution of science, engineering and
technology to economic competitiveness
and improving the quality of life. A key role
is played by the public sector as the prime
funder of purely curiosity-driven (or basic)
science: as well as playing a crucial part in
advancing scientific knowledge and
producing well-trained researchers, such
research can often lead to unexpectedly
exploitable results.
Business has the prime responsibility for
researching and developing new and
improved products and services, while
government tries to create the climate for
the development of new ideas and to
facilitate technology transfer and access.
The Government aims to encourage
industry to invest more in R & D and take a
longer-term view of R & D investment.
Government policies on science,
engineering and technology will be
developed in the light of the overall public
spending review and of its findings of the
Hearing Committee Report on the financing
of higher education (see p. 451). The
Government aims to improve the way in
which science is used to formulate and
execute policy across government

departments. Britain’s participation in
European Union (EU) co-operative R & D
will be strengthened; negotiations are in
progress regarding the content and
organisation of the EU Fifth Framework
Programme, due to run from 1998 to 2002
(see p. 336).
BACKGROUND
British achievements in science and
technology in the 20th century include
fundamental contributions to molecular
genetics through the discovery of the three-
dimensional molecular structure of DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid) by Francis Crick,
Maurice Wilkins, James Watson and Rosalind
Franklin in 1953 and of cholesterol, vitamin
D, penicillin and insulin by Dorothy Hodgkin.
Notable contributions in other areas over
the past 25 years have been made by Stephen
Hawking in improving the understanding of
the nature and origin of the universe; Brian
Josephson in superconductivity (abnormally
high electrical conductivity at low
temperatures); Martin Ryle and Antony
Hewish in radio astrophysics; and Godfrey
Hounsfield in computer-assisted tomography
(a form of radiography) for medical diagnosis.
Other pioneering work includes the
discovery in 1985 by British Antarctic Survey
scientists of the hole in the ozone layer over
the Antarctic. Researchers at the Laboratory
of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, produced
the first monoclonal antibodies-—proteins
produced by genetic engineering with
enormous potential in the diagnosis and
treatment of disease. More recently there
have been several British breakthroughs in
genetics research, including the identification
of the gene in the Y chromosome responsible
for determining sex, and the identification
of other genes linked to diseases such as
cystic fibrosis and a form of breast cancer.
The world’s first pig with a genetically
modified heart was bred by scientists at
Cambridge University, an important
milestone in breeding animals as organ
donors for people. In 1997 scientists at the
Roslin Institute in Edinburgh succeeded in
‘cloning’ a sheep using a cell from the sheep’s
mammary gland.
Other examples of notable R & D successes
in the chemicals, electronics, software and
aerospace sectors, all areas where Britain
excels, are given below. (For R & D work in
materials, see chapter 15, p. 224.)
Chemicals
Research undertaken by the chemicals
industry over the past few years has led to
many significant technological and
commercial breakthroughs. New synthetic
fibres, detergent formulations and catalytic
processes have been developed in Britain.
Pharmaceuticals is the most research¬
intensive sector of the chemicals industry.
British firms have been responsible for
discovering and developing five of the
world’s 20 best-selling drugs (see p. 219).
Research conducted by ICI, Glaxo
Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and Fisons
led to the development of the first successful
beta blockers, drugs used in the treatment of
cardiovascular conditions; semi-synthetic
penicillins; vaccines; and treatments for
cancer, asthma, migraine, arthritis and
HIV/AIDS. More than 200 potential new
medicines are currently under development
in British laboratories.
The biotechnology sector continues to
grow, with an increasing number of
specialist companies contributing to
scientific breakthroughs. Many research
projects focus on the application of
biotechnology to pharmaceuticals and
chemicals, food and agriculture, and the
environment industries.
Electronics
British firms and research organisations
have led in the development and application
of semiconductors, including the ‘three-five’ I
semiconductor materials (such as gallium
arsenide). These materials have many uses,
including lasers for optical fibre
communications, microwave devices for
satellite communications, and high-
efficiency solar cells.
Firms such as BT have been at the forefront
in developing optical fibre cable; BT produced
the first all-optical repeater. Software
326
engineering for telecommunications and other
applications is another area where Britain
excels. Engineers are developing ‘virtual reality’
techniques used for designing buildings,
vehicles, pharmaceuticals and a host of other
products. Electronic medical equipment made
in Britain is sold all over the world; Britain
pioneered magnetic resonance imaging.
Aerospace
Pioneering British achievements since the
1930s include radar, jet engines, Concorde
(with France), automatic landing, vertical
take-off and landing, flight simulators, ejector
seats and head-up displays. British Aerospace,
with Marconi and Dowty Boulton Paul,
devised a system known as ‘fly-by-wire’, in
which flying control surfaces are moved by
electronic rather than mechanical means.
British Aerospace is currently working with
government and academic laboratories on the
use of‘smart materials’ in aircraft. These are
structures within the aircraft which can
continuously monitor for signs of damage or
wear and communicate with the pilot through
fibre optic cables, thereby improving safety
and lowering maintenance costs.
Among overseas private sector companies
with major R & D investments in Britain
are Daewoo, Du Pont, Psizer, IBM,
Johnson & Johnson, Nissan, Sharp and
Sony. Eight of the United States’ top ten
software firms, including Microsoft (see p.
340), have large-scale R & D facilities in
Britain. South-east England has the
highest concentration of R & D operations.
The strong industry-academic links that
exist in Britain are one of the main reasons
quoted for locating in the country.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EXPENDITURE
Total expenditure in Britain on scientific R &
D in 1995 was £14,300 million, 2.05 per cent
of gross domestic product (compared with
2.11 per cent in 1994). Expenditure on civil R
& D was £12, 200 million in 1995, the rest
going to defence projects. Since the ending of

the Cold War, there has been a marked shift in
the balance between civil and defence-related
R&D, reflected, for example, in a reduction
in real terms in aerospace R & D. As a
percentage of GDP, defence spending on R &
D declined from 0.5 to 0.3 per cent between
1990 and 1995.
About 48 per cent of total funding was
provided by industry and 33 per cent by
government; a further 14 per cent came from
abroad. Significant contributions were also
made by private endowments, trusts and
charities. As well as financing R&D carried
out in industry itself, industry also supports
university research and finances contract
research at government establishments. Some
charities have their own laboratories and offer
grants for outside research. Contract research
organisations carry out R & D for companies
and are playing an increasingly important role
in the transfer of technology to British
industry.
Total spending on R & D in industry
amounted to £9,400 million in 1995. Of this
total, British industry’s own contribution was
69 per cent, with 12 per cent from government
and the rest from overseas. The chemistry and
biotechnology-based sectors—chemicals,
327
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
pharmaceuticals and healthcare—account for
28 per cent of R & D spending by listed
companies; electronics and aerospace are also
big investors in R & D. The three biggest
investors in R & D—Glaxo Wellcome,
SmithKline Beecham and Zeneca—are all in
the pharmaceuticals sector (see Table 20:1).
GOVERNMENT ROLE
Science and technology issues as a whole are
the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),
assisted by a Minister of State; they are
supported by the Office of Science and
Technology (OST), a separate entity within
the DTI. The OST is headed by the
Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser. It
provides a central focus for the development
of government policy on science, engineering
and technology, both nationally and
internationally. In addition, it co-ordinates
science and technology policy across
government departments. The Director
General of Research Councils reports directly
to the Cabinet on the Science Budget and
other matters. The Science Budget covers
expenditure in the academic sector, Research
Council institutes and units, certain
international research centres funded by the
six funding Research Councils and from grant
in aid to the Royal Society and the Royal
Academy of Engineering.
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is
used to describe the research and postgraduate
training capacity based in the universities and
colleges of higher education and in
establishments operated by the Research
Councils and government departments,
together with the national and international
central facilities (such as CERN—see p. 336)
supported by the Councils and available for
use by British scientists and engineers. There
are also important contributions from private
institutions, chiefly those funded by charities.
The science and engineering base is the main
provider of basic research and much of the
strategic research (research likely to have
practical applications) carried out in Britain. It
also collaborates with the private sector in the
conduct of specific applied research. Nearly
two-thirds of the Government’s spending on
The Government works to help Britain
strengthen its position as a world leader

projects, award schemes and a
network of local support centres, the
programme encourages the
development and delivery of
information technologies and their
adoption by businesses, especially
smaller firms.
• IT for All aims to remove social,
educational and psychological barriers
facing non-users of IT, by raising
awareness of the new technologies and
providing access to them.
The programmes involve partnership
between government, business, trade
associations, professional institutions,
voluntary groups and the general public.
Current participants include Microsoft,
BT, IBM, Dixons and ICL, as well as the
Open University and the British Deaf
Association.
civil R & D supports basic and strategic
research undertaken in the science and
engineering base.
The OST has specific responsibility for the
Science Budget and the government-financed
Research Councils (see pp. 337-40): the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council (EPSRC); the Medical Research
Council (MRC); the Particle Physics and
Astronomy Research Council (PPARC); the
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC); the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); the
Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC); and the Council for the Central
Laboratory of the Research Councils
(CCLRC). OST funding provides assistance
for research, through the Research Councils,
in the following ways: by awarding grants and
contracts to universities and other higher
328
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
education establishments and to research
units; funding Research Council
establishments to perform research or to
provide facilities and expertise in support of
research supporting postgraduate study; and
subscribing to international scientific
organisations. The OST also provides funding
for some programmes administered through
the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of
Engineering (see p. 341). The other main
sources of finance for universities are the
higher education funding councils (see p.
452).
Strategy and Finance
Government finance goes to research
establishments, higher education institutions
and private industry, as well as collaborative
research programmes. Total net government
expenditure on science and technology (both
civil and defence) in 1997-98 is £6,300 million,
of which £3,800 million will be devoted to civil
science. The Science Budget totals £1,330
million for 1997-98. Among government
departments, the Ministry of Defence (MoD—
see p. 332) has the largest research budget. The
main civil departments are the Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI—see p. 331), the
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions (DETR—see p. 333) and the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF—see p. 333).
The funding and organisation of British
science, engineering and technology have
changed considerably in recent years, in
accordance with the White Paper, Realising Our
Potential: A Strategy for Science, Engineering
and Technology. Published in 1993, this was the
first major review of science for over 20 years.
It aimed to create a closer partnership between
government, industry and the scientific
community in developing strengths in areas of
importance to the future economic well-being
of Britain. It established the Foresight
Programme for the public and private sectors
to work together to identify opportunities in
markets and technologies likely to emerge over
the next 10 to 20 years, and the actions to be
taken to exploit them. Government priorities in
science, engineering and technology
programmes, and in government regulation and
training responsibilities, are being guided by
the Programme.
The Foresight Programme is co-ordinated
by a joint industry/academic steering group
headed by the Government’s Chief Scientific
Adviser. The steering group identified six
cross-sectoral themes or priority areas:
• communications and computing power
(with applications in all economic
sectors);
• new organisms, products and processes
from genetics (with applications in
health, agriculture, food and
environmental protection);
• materials science, engineering and
technology;
• production processes and services;
• pollution monitoring and control
technologies, and technologies for
conserving energy and other resources;
and
• social trends (improving understanding
of human factors involved in markets and
scientific advance).
Sixteen sector panels, made up of people
from industry, academia and government,
examine opportunities in specific branches of
science, engineering and technology.
Government departments, universities and
higher education funding councils, as well as
the Research Councils, are reflecting Foresight
priorities in their research spending allocations.
The private sector is encouraged to take
account of the priorities both in its participation
in collaborative research programmes and in its
own strategic planning. The Government is
providing £30 million over four years for the
first round of the Foresight Challenge
Competition, to fund collaborative R & D
projects which address priorities identified by
the Foresight panels. This is complemented by
a further £62 million from private sector
project participants. An additional £200 million
or so has already been channelled into other
Foresight initiatives.
ROPA AND CASE
The Realising Our Potential Award (ROPA)
scheme focuses on researchers already
329
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
working closely with industry. Managed by
the Research Councils, it provides funding for
separate ‘curiosity-driven’ research. To date,
the total value of ROPA awards amounts to
£109 million for more than 1,200 projects; this
includes government funding of £19.5 million
for 1997. The Government also makes funds
available through the Research Councils for
the Co-operative Awards in Science and
Engineering (CASE) scheme, which supports
students on research projects jointly
supervised with industry.
EQUAL—Extend Quality Life
One of the principal issues facing Britain in
the years ahead is a growing elderly
population. Life expectancy has risen, but has
not been matched by an increase in years free
from disability. The EQUAL scheme aims to
examine the effects of lifestyle and diet on
health, and to develop technologies to enhance
the quality of life of an ageing population.
LINK
The LINK scheme provides a government¬
wide framework for collaborative research in
support of wealth creation and improvement
of the quality of life. It aims to promote
partnerships in commercially relevant research
projects between industry and higher
education institutions and other research base
organisations. Under the scheme, government
departments and Research Councils fund up

Regions, and the BBSRC, in conjunction
with industry. Priority research areas include

to 50 per cent of the cost of research projects,
with industry providing the balance. So far
there have been 56 LINK programmes; more
than 800 projects worth over £410 million
have been started, with the participation of
1,100 companies and 180 research base
institutions. Since 1995, 17 new programmes
have been announced in response to priorities
identified by the Foresight Programme: for
instance, in 1996 the DTI and the EPSRC
launched an £8 million LINK programme on
sensors and sensor systems for industrial
applications.
SMART—Small Lirms Award for Research
and Technology
Following a review of government support
for R & D by small businesses, a new locally
operated single SMART scheme was .
introduced in England in April 1997. Under
this, financial assistance is available for
feasibility studies into innovative technology
(up to £45,000 for independent firms with
fewer than 50 employees) and for
development up to pre-production prototype
stage of new products and processes involving
a significant technological advance (in most
cases, up to 200,000 ECUs for independent
businesses with fewer than 250 employees).
The new scheme reflects the objectives of the
Foresight Programme. Business Links (see p.
195) have an important role in generating
suitable R & D projects, assisting firms to
submit applications for SMART awards and
ensuring assisted projects are fully exploited
commercially. Separate schemes are operated
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Public Awareness
The Government seeks to raise the status of
science, engineering and technology among
the general public, by increasing awareness of
the contribution that they make to Britain’s
economic wealth and quality of life; and by
improving the understanding of scientific
terms, concepts and issues, so that public
debate on controversial scientific and
technological issues becomes better
informed. Raising awareness is also
330
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
important in encouraging young people to
pursue careers in science and engineering. To
this end, it supports activities such as the
annual science festival of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science
(BAAS) and the National Week of Science,
Engineering and Technology. The fourth of
these Weeks, held in March 1997, consisted
of 1,600 events held all over Britain,
attracting more than 1 million visitors.
The year 1997 was designated the Year
of Engineering Success (YES). This initiative
is intended to increase public awareness of
the role of engineers in wealth creation and
life enhancement and is fully supported by
both the engineering profession and
industry.
Science festivals are a growing feature of
local co-operative efforts to further
understanding of the contribution made by
science to everyday life. Schools, museums,
laboratories, higher education institutions and
industry contribute to a variety of special
events. The oldest festival is the British
Association Annual Festival of Science, held
at a British university. The BAAS helps
organise the National Science, Engineering
and Technology Week. The largest science
festival in one place is the annual Edinburgh
International Science Festival; in 1997 it
included 260 events and attracted about
175,000 visitors.
The Committee on the Public
Understanding of Science (COPUS), set up
by the Royal Society, the BAAS and the Royal
Institution (see p. 342), acts as a co-ordinator
for those fostering public understanding and
promotes best practice in the field. COPUS
awards small grants on behalf of both OST
and the Royal Society and, jointly with the
Science Museum, administers the Rhone-
Poulenc Prize for Science Books.
Role of Women
A Development Unit was set up in the OST
in response to an independent report which
found that women were still under¬
represented in the science, engineering and
technology sectors, especially at senior levels.
It also disclosed that many women drop out of
a science career, often to raise children, and do
not return. The Unit has highlighted the
economic and other benefits to business of
providing a working environment sensitive to
the needs of women scientists and engineers
who combine a career and family
responsibilities. It seeks to ensure that careers
information for girls and women is widely
available and to promote good employment
practices. Measures are being taken by
government and others to publicise best
practice in childcare facilities, job sharing,
flexible working and career breaks.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry
In 1997-98 DTFs planned expenditure on
science, engineering and technology is £363
million. This covers innovation and
technology, aeronautics, space (see p. 334),
and nuclear and non-nuclear energy. In
supporting these activities, DTPs overall aim
is to work in partnership with business, the
science and technology base, the education
sector, other government departments and
interested organisations, to bring about
improved innovation performance across the
whole range of business sectors and thereby
help companies compete more effectively in
global markets. DTPs role includes working
to change attitudes in favour of innovation in
industry; encouraging partnerships and the
exchange of people and knowledge between
companies, colleges and universities;
improving the accessibility of finance for
emerging technology based firms with growth
potential; and to help small firms overcome
obstacles to growth.
For the DTI, innovation frequently
involves not only a commitment to research
and development and the adoption or
adaptation of new and existing technologies,
but also the improvement of every other
aspect of business, including finance,
marketing, design, management of people and
people skills. Through its Innovation Unit, a
mixed team of seconded industrialists and
government officials, DTI seeks to encourage
and facilitate business, education, the media,
government and the general public to adopt
innovation as a vital contribution to improved
331
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
performance, international competitiveness
and sustainable growth. In Northern Ireland
the Industrial Research and Technology Unit
has a similar role to that of the DTI,
supporting industrial R & D, technology
transfer and innovation.
Academic-Business Partnerships
The DTI is spending almost £50 million on
technology transfer and access in 1997-98. It
aims to increase the number and quality of
partnerships between the science, engineering
and technology base and industry; improve
access to sources of technology and
technological expertise; improve the capacity
of industry to use technology effectively; and
increase the uptake of the latest technology
and best practice techniques.
An example of a technology transfer
programme is TCS (formerly known as the
Teaching Company Scheme), which has 11
government department and Research Council
sponsors, and for which DTI has the main
responsibility. Currently, over 1,000 graduates
have places on TCS programmes, which
enable them to work in industry, normally for
two years, on technology transfer projects
under the joint supervision of academic and
company staff. There are also 19 TCS Centres
for Small Firms designed to make it easier for
small firms to gain access to technology in
universities and to demonstrate the benefits of
employing graduates.
Aeronautics
The DTFs Civil Aircraft Research and
Demonstration Programme (CARAD)
supports research and technology
demonstration in aeronautics, enabling the
industry to compete effectively in world
markets (see p. 226). In 1997-98 the provision
for aeronautics research and technology
demonstration is £23 million. The programme
is an essential part of a national aeronautics
research effort, with over half of the supported
research work being conducted in industry and
the universities, and the remainder at the
Defence Evaluation and Research Agency
(DERA—see below). CARAD and earlier
programmes have supported projects across the
range of aeronautics technologies, including
compressors, turbines, noise, nacelles and
materials. They have helped Rolls-Royce to
increase its share of the large civil engine
market (see p. 228), and British Aerospace has
become Europe’s foremost designer and
manufacturer of wings for large civil aircraft.
Launch Aid is a means of providing
government assistance for specific development
projects in the aerospace industry.
Measurement Standards
The DTI finances the development of new
measurement standards under the National
Measurement System (NMS—see p. 194) and
materials metrology programmes. Most of the
work is carried out at the National Physical
Laboratory (NPL), the Laboratory of the
Government Chemist (LGC) and the National
Engineering Laboratory (NEL). Spending
about £34 million a year, the NMS provides
an infrastructure to ensure that measures can
be made on a consistent basis throughout
Britain. The accelerating pace of technological
change and the greater awareness of the
importance of quality and innovation have led
to increasing demands for measurement
standards and calibrations which has been
met, in part, through increases in efficiency.
Ministry of Defence
The Ministry of Defence has the largest
government research budget—£2,133 million
for 1997^98, of which about £572 million is
for medium- and long-term applied research
relevant to military needs. With the ending of
the Cold War, the Government is committed
to achieving a gradual reduction in real terms
in spending on defence R & D.
The Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (DERA) is the largest single scientific
employer in Britain. Its role is to supply
scientific and technical services primarily to
the Ministry but also to other government
departments. DERA has set up five dual-use
(civil-military) technology centres in subjects
ranging from structural materials to high-
performance computing, to enhance the
332
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
degree of collaboration between DERA,
industry and the academic science base.
DERA subcontracts research to industry
and universities, ensuring that their know-how
is harnessed to meeting military requirements.
It also works closely with industry in order to
see that scientific and technological advances
are integrated at an early stage into
development and production. This technology
transfer is not just confined to the defence
industry but has also led to important ‘spin¬
offs’ into civil markets, in fields ranging from
new materials and electronic devices to
advanced aerodynamics. The latter in
particular has been instrumental in giving
Britain a leading role in civil aircraft design.
Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions
The Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions funds research in
the following broad policy areas: environmental
protection, including water, radioactive
substances, chemicals and environmental
technology; planning and the countryside; local
government; housing; construction; transport
congestion; the environmental impact of
transport; transport safety and security; and
mobility for elderly and disabled people. Some
of the biggest programmes are those on
pollution-related climate change, regional and
urban air quality, construction, best practice in
energy efficiency and primary and secondary
safety of transport users. Total expenditure for
1997-98 is about £140 million, including the
Environment Agency (see p. 348) R & D
programme of £10 million in 1997-98. British
scientific expertise is being made available in
developing countries to protect threatened
species of plants and animals as part of the
Darwin Initiative (see p. 366). The Department
has committed £12 million to 116 projects in
nearly 60 countries. The Department is also
responsible for the Health and Safety
Commission and Executive.
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food
MAFF co-ordinates its research programme
with The Scottish Office Agriculture,
Environment and Fisheries Department, the
Department of Agriculture for Northern
Ireland and the Research Councils. It also
covers the research interests of the Welsh
Office Agriculture Department.
The programme reflects the Ministry’s
wide-ranging responsibilities for protecting
and enhancing the rural and marine
environment; protecting the public, especially
in food safety and quality, flooding and coastal
defence, and animal health and welfare; and
improving the economic performance of the
agriculture, fishing and food industries.
The budget for research expenditure in
1997-98 is £139 million, including support
for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (see p.
342). Research is contracted increasingly
through open competition with Research
Councils, the Ministry’s agencies, non-
departmental public bodies, higher education
institutions and other organisations.
Department of Health
The Department of Health’s R & D strategy
comprises two complementary programmes:
the Policy Research Programme and the
National Health Service R & D Programme.
The Department also oversees the research
programmes of the health-related non-
departrriental public bodies. It will spend
about £68.1 million in 1997-98. In addition,
the centrally and regionally funded R & D
programmes of the NHS Executive will spend
around £61.8 million that year. NHS Trusts
(see chapter 24) spent £334 million in
1995-96, covering 39,000 projects. The
Department promotes strong links between
its programmes and the science base, and
with Research Councils, charities, industry
and the European Union. Together with the
Medical Research Council, it helped shape
the EU’s Biomedicine and Health Research
Programme within the Fourth Framework
Programme (see p. 336).
Department for International
Development
The Department for International
Development commissions and sponsors
333
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
technology development and research (TDR)
on topics relevant to those geographical
regions designated as the primary targets of
the aid programme and of benefit to the
poorest people in those countries. Provision
for TDR in 1997-98 is £79 million. Its
support for strategic TDR is organised into
five main programmes, covering renewable
natural resources and the environment;
engineering-related sectors (water and
sanitation, energy efficiency and geoscience,
urbanisation and transport); health and
population; economic and social
development; and education. TDR is also
carried out as part of Britain’s bilateral aid to
particular countries.
The Department also contributes to
international centres and programmes
undertaking TDR aimed at solving problems
faced by developing countries. These
contributions include support for the EU’s
Science and Technology for Development
programme, which sponsors research in
renewable natural resources, agriculture,
health and information technologies.
Scottish Office
The annual value of government-financed
(non-military) research in Scotland is about
£335 million. Some £135 million goes to
Scottish research institutions from British
bodies, mainly the Research Councils.
Around £200 million is administratively
controlled by The Scottish Office. The
Scottish Higher Education Funding Council
grants £106 million for research in higher
education institutions. This enables them to
sustain a research infrastructure, and gives
some discretion to determine their own
priorities.
The Scottish Office also funds research in
support of its main responsibilities in light of
current priorities, and the programmes of
other research funders, including other
government departments, Research Councils
and industry. For instance, the Scottish
Office Agriculture, Environment and
Fisheries Department invests about £50
million in research each year, largely in the
Scottish Agricultural and Biological Research
Institutes and the Scottish Agricultural
College. In many areas—medicine,
agriculture and biological sciences, fisheries
and marine science—public sector research in
Scotland has an international reputation.
The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department encourages the
development of science-based industry, for
example, by promoting and administering
government industrial R & D schemes, and
promoting participation in, and dissemination
of results from, EU R & D programmes. The
enterprise network in Scotland—Scottish
Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise i
and LECs (see chapter 14)—addresses the
need for innovation and technology transfer,
both through grant support for product and
process innovation and through a wide range
of initiatives. In August 1996, Scottish
Enterprise, together with the Royal Society of
Edinburgh (see p. 341), launched the
Technology Ventures Initiative which aims to
improve the exploitation of research in
Scotland and is the result of a two-year
inquiry and research programme which
involved business, academia, financial
institutions and the public sector. Since its
launch, a number of specific projects are
being pursued and work is underpinned by an
awareness raising campaign on the
importance of commercialising science and
technology.
Space Activities
Britain’s space programme is brought
together through the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership between
government departments and the Research
Councils. BNSC’s key aims are to develop
practical and economic uses of space, to
promote the competitiveness of British space
companies in world markets and to maintain
Britain’s position in space science. These are j
realised primarily by collaboration with other
European nations through the European
Space Agency (ESA).
Through BNSC, the Government spends
around £200 million a year on space activities.
About two thirds of this is channelled
through ESA for collaborative programmes
on Earth observation, telecommunications
and space science, much of which returns to
334
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Britain through contracts awarded to British
industry. The rest is spent on international
meteorological programmes carried out
through the European Meteorological
Satellite Organisation (EUMETSAT) and the
national programme which is aimed at
complementing the R&D supported through
ESA.
Around half of Britain’s space programme
is concerned with satellite-based Earth
observation (remote-sensing) for commercial
and environmental applications. Britain
contributed strongly to ESA’s ERS-1 and
ERS-2 satellites, which were launched
respectively in 1991 and 1995. It provided
two of the instruments on both satellites. The
first, a Synthetic Aperture Radar, is capable
of supplying high-resolution images of the
Earth with 24-hour coverage irrespective of
cloud cover conditions; the second, an Along
Track Scanning Radiometer, measures global
sea surface temperature to a very high degree
of accuracy.
Britain is also a major contributor to the
development of ESA’s latest Earth
observation satellite, ENVISAT, due to be
launched in 1999. This will carry a new
generation of radar and radiometer systems as
well as other scientific environmental
instruments, some of which have either been
designed or constructed in Britain. The
complete satellite is being assembled at a
purpose-built factory in Bristol, operated by
the Anglo-French space company, Matra
Marconi Space. British companies are also
leading the development of microsatellites.
Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, based at the
University of Surrey, and Satellite
Innovations Ltd, have both developed and
successfully launched scientific and
commercial microsatellites for British and
overseas customers.
Britain has a world-class reputation in
space science. A quarter of its space budget is
devoted to space science, in support of
astronomy, planetary science and geophysics.
Contributions have been made to missions
ranging from the Hubble Space Telescope to
the Ulysses solar space probe. Britain is
contributing substantially to the SOHO
mission to study the Sun; to the Infrared
Space Observatory, which is investigating the
birth and death of stars; and also to the
Cassini Huygens mission, a seven-year
programme to send a probe to Saturn and its
moon Titan, launched in October 1997. It is
also participating in XMM, ESA’s X-ray
spectroscopy mission, which will investigate
X-ray emissions from black holes, due to be
launched in 1999.
Britain has many bilateral agreements for
scientific research with other countries, such
as Russia, Japan and the United States.
British scientists developed, for example, the
widefield camera for ROSAT (the German,
British and US X-ray satellite), and a
spectrometer for the Japanese-built Yohkoh
satellite. They are also providing an X-ray
telescope for the Russian Spectrum-X
mission, expected to be launched in 1998.
Another major area of British space
expertise is satellite communications and
navigation. In Europe, Britain is both a
leading producer and user of satellite
communications technology (see p. 229). It is
taking a leading role in preparations for future
ESA satellite communications missions,
including ARTEMIS, which will provide
important communications links for the
ENVISAT programme. Britain is also
contributing to the development of a global
navigation satellite system within Europe
which will augment the United States GPS
system to provide increased accuracy and
reliability required for civil aviation global
navigation.
Through the PPARC (see p. 338), Britain
is taking a leading role in the current
largest international project in ground-
based astronomy. The Gemini project
involves building two 8m telescopes at
Mauna Kea (Hawaii) and Cerro Pachon
(Chile). These are due to be completed
respectively in 1999 and 2001. The other
partners are the United States, Canada,
Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Britain has a
25 per cent stake in the work, with major
responsibility for the primary mirror
support system and much of the control
software.
335
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
European Union
Since 1984 the EU has operated a series of R
& D framework programmes in several
strategic sectors, with the aim of strengthening
the scientific and technological basis of
European industry and supporting the
development of EU policies. The Fourth
Framework Programme runs from 1994 to
1998. It has a budget of about ^10,000 million
and provides funds for international
collaborative research in fields such as
biotechnology, industrial materials and
information technology. In the main part of
the programme, more than half of all projects
include British participation—in areas such as
bio-medicine, agriculture, transport, and
social and economic research.
Two examples of the many EU research
activities involving British organisations, both
of which are part of the Fourth Framework
Programme, are:
• the EU’s Information Technology
Programme, which is a shared cost
collaborative programme designed to help
build the services and technologies that
underpin the information society. The
programme is open to companies,
academic institutions and research bodies.
Britain is currently participating in over
500 projects in the programme; and
• the Training and Mobility of Researchers
(TMR) programme, which aims to
develop human resources for science and
technology through promoting high-level
training for researchers and encouraging
their mobility across the community.
Britain is the most popular destination
under the programme, with over 30 per
cent of TMR fellows opting to train in
British laboratories.
Other International Activities
Over 800 British organisations have taken
part in EUREKA, an industry-led scheme to
encourage European co-operation in
developing and producing advanced products
and processes with worldwide sales potential.
There are 26 members of EUREKA,
including the 15 EU countries and the
European Commission. Around 670 projects
are in progress, involving around 3,000 firms,
universities and research organisations. One
British-led project is concerned with
developing glass-reinforced polymers that
could replace steel in vehicle suspensions,
leading to the production of more comfortable
and more fuel-efficient cars which would
cause less damage to road surfaces. As strong
as steel, these polymers are lighter and can
bend further.
The COST programme (European Co¬
operation in the field of Science and
Technical research) encourages co-operation
in national research activities across Europe,
with participants from industry, academia and
research laboratories. Transport,
telecommunications and materials have
traditionally been the largest areas supported.
New areas include physics, chemistry,
neuroscience and the application of
biotechnology to agriculture, including
forestry. There are 25 member states and
Britain takes part in almost all of about 140
current COST actions.
Other examples of international
collaboration include the European Space
Agency (see p. 334), and CERN, the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics,
based in Geneva, where the proposed Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) is due to be
completed by 2005. Scientific programmes at
CERN aim to test, verify and develop the
‘standard model’ of the origins and structure
of the universe. There are 19 member states.
Britain’s programme is co-ordinated through
the GCLRC and the subscription is paid by
the PPARC. Contributions to the high-flux
neutron source at the Institut Laue-Langevin
and the European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility, both in Grenoble, are paid by the
EPSRC. The PPARC is a partner in the
European Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility
within the Arctic Circle, which conducts
research on the ionosphere. NERC has a
major involvement in international
programmes of research into global climate
change organised through the World Climate
Research Programme and the International
Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. It also
336
supports Britain’s subscription to the Ocean
Drilling Program.
Through the MRC, Britain participates in
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory
(EMBL), based in Heidelberg, Germany.
Britain was chosen as the location for the
European Bioinformatics Institute, an
outstation of the EMBL. The Institute, based
at Hinxton, near Cambridge, provides up-to-
date information on molecular biology and
genome sequencing for researchers
throughout Europe. The MRC pays Britain’s
contribution to the Human Frontier Science
Programme, which supports international
collaborative research into brain function and
biological function through molecular level
approaches. It also pays Britain’s subscription
to the International Agency for Cancer
Research.
Britain is a member of the science and
technology committees of international
organisations such as the OECD and NATO,
and of various specialised agencies of the
United Nations, including UNESCO. The
Research Councils, the Royal Society and the
British Academy are members of the
European Science Foundation, and a number
of British scientists are involved in its
initiatives.
The British Government also enters into
bilateral agreements with other governments
to encourage closer collaboration in science,
engineering and technology. Staff in British
Embassies, High Commissions and British
Council offices (see below) conduct
government business on, and promote
contacts in, science, engineering and
technology between Britain and overseas
countries; and help to inform a large number
of organisations in Britain about science,
engineering and technology developments
and initiatives overseas. There are science and
technology sections in British Missions in
Paris, Tokyo, Washington, Peking, Bonn,
Moscow, Seoul and Rome.
The British Council (see p. 140) promotes
better understanding and knowledge of
Britain, including its scientific and
technological achievements. As well as
supplying information on science and science
policy, it fosters co-operation in research,
training and education through, for example,
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
exchange of specialists. The Council also
identifies and manages technological,
scientific and educational projects in
developing countries. The Research Councils
maintain, with the British Council, a joint
office in Brussels to promote European co¬
operation in research.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each Research Council is an autonomous
body established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industry and
government. The Councils support research,
study and training in universities and other
higher education institutions, and carry out or
support research, through their own institutes
and at international research centres, often
jointly with other public sector bodies and
international organisations. They provide
awards to about 15,000 postgraduate students
in science, social sciences, engineering and
technology. In addition to funding from the
OST, the Councils receive income from
research commissioned by government
departments and the private sector; such
income is particularly important for the
BBSRC, NERC and CCLRC.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council
The EPSRC, the Research Council with the
largest budget—£386 million in 1997-98—
has responsibility for developing and
sustaining basic, strategic and applied research
in engineering and the physical sciences. Its
remit is delivered through eight programme
areas: physics, chemistry and mathematics, the
generic technologies of information
technology and materials, and three
engineering programmes. The latter comprise
general engineering (concentrating on
strengthening the health of the engineering
disciplines), engineering for manufacturing
(enhancing industrial competitiveness), and
engineering for infrastructure, the
environment and healthcare (improving
quality of life).
In July 1997 EPSRC launched four pilot
Faraday Partnerships, each with initial
337
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
funding of up to £50,000 and additional
funding of up to £1 million for specific
collaborative research and training. The
partnerships aim to improve the links between
the research base and industry, particularly
small and medium-sized enterprises. Areas
covered in the pilot partnerships are: products
comprising interdependent mechanical and
electronic parts; enhanced packaging
technology; intelligent sensors for control
technologies; and 3D multimedia applications
and technology integration.
Medical Research Council
The MRC, with a budget of £289 million for
1997-98, is the main source of public funds
for biomedical research. It supports research
and training aimed at improving human
health to meet the needs of user communities,
including the providers of healthcare and the
biotechnology, food, healthcare, medical
instrumentation, pharmaceutical and other
biomedical-related industries. About half the
MRC’s expenditure is allocated to its own
institutes and units, the rest going mainly on
grant support of research in universities,
including training awards. The Council has
two large institutes—Ahe National Institute
for Medical Research at Mill Hill in London
and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
Cambridge; it also runs the Clinical Sciences
Centre at the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School, London. It has more than 40 research
units and a number of smaller teams.
Research financed by the MRC is
conducted in seven broad areas:
• macromolecules, cells, and development
biology (including basic studies of
molecular structures and properties, cell
biology, developmental biology and
biochemistry);
• genetic blueprint and health (including
human genome mapping, structure and
function of genes, gene therapy and
genetic diagnosis and screening);
• environment and defences: nutrition,
chemicals, radiation and trauma
(including toxicology, environmental
toxins, nutritional and lifestyle effects on
health, and factors influencing healthy
growth and development;
environment and defences: infections,
immunity and inflammation (including
basic studies of disease-causing
organisms, the function and development
of the immune system, autoimmune
diseases, vaccination, and antibiotics);
• neurosciences and mental health
(including all basic and applied studies
relating to the nervous system, and
psychology);
• organ systems and cancer (including
heart disease and stroke, ageing, diabetes,
reproduction, musculo-skeletal system,
as well as cancer); and
• health services and public health research
(including evaluative and social studies,
clinical trials, evaluation of new
treatments, and studies of social factors
in health).
Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council
The main task of the PPARC, which has a
budget of £199 million for 1997-98, is to
sustain and develop research into fundamental
physical processes. It maintains four research
establishments: the Royal Greenwich
Observatory at Cambridge, the Royal
Observatory at Edinburgh and overseas
observatories on La Palma in the Canary
Islands and on Hawaii. The PPARC supports
research in three main areas: particle
physics—theoretical and experimental
research into elementary particles and the
fundamental forces of nature; astronomy
(including astrophysics and cosmology)—
studying the origin, structure and evolution of
the universe, and the life-cycle and properties
of stars and galaxies; and planetary science
(including solar terrestrial physics)—studying
the origin and evolution of the solar system
and the influence of the Sun on planetary
bodies, particularly Earth.
The Council’s work is in fields where
international co-operation is particularly
important: for example, it makes substantial
338
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
contributions to the European Space Agency
and CERN (see pp. 334 and 336).
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council
The BBSRC has a budget of £183 million for
1997-98. It supports basic and strategic
research and research training related to the
understanding and exploitation of biological
systems, which underpin the agriculture,
bioprocessing, chemical, food, healthcare,
pharmaceutical and other biotechnology-
related industries. The scientific themes are
biomolecular sciences; genes and
developmental biology; biochemistry and cell
biology; plant and microbial sciences; animal
sciences; agrifood; and engineering and
biological systems. As well as funding research
in universities and other research centres
throughout Britain, the BBSRC sponsors
eight research institutes: the Babraham
Institute, the Institute of Arable Crops
Research, Institute for Animal Health,
Institute of Food Research, Institute of
Grassland and Environmental Research, John
Innes Centre, Roslin Institute and Silsoe
Research Institute.
Natural Environment Research Council
NERC is principally concerned with the
themes of sustainable development,
environmental protection, and the quality of
life. In 1997-98 it will spend most of its budget
allocation of £167 million in the following
areas: understanding and protecting
biodiversity; environmental risks and hazards;
global change; natural resources—management
of land, water and the coastal zone; pollution of
air, land, sea and fresh water; and waste
management—bioremediation (biological
treatment of pollution), and land restoration.
The Council supports research in its own
and other research establishments as well as
research and training in universities. It also
provides a range of facilities for use by the
wider environmental science community,
including a marine research fleet. NERC
establishments include the British Geological
Survey, the British Antarctic Survey, the
Centre for Coastal and Marine Sciences and
the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,
together with a number of university-based
units. A new national centre for oceanographic
science and technology, the Southampton
Oceanography Centre, was opened in 1996. A
joint venture with Southampton University, it
undertakes research, training and support
activities in oceanography, geology and aspects
of marine technology and engineering.
NERC’s Research Vessel Services are also
located at the Centre.
Economic and Social Research Council
The ESRC, with an R & D provision of £65
million for 1997-98, supports research and
training to meet the needs of its users and to
enhance Britain’s economic competitiveness,
quality of life, and the effectiveness of public
services and policy. All research funded by the
ESRC is conducted in higher education
institutions or independent research institutes.
The Council has nine priority themes:
economic performance and development;
environment and sustainability; globalisation,
regions and emerging markets; governance
regulation and accountability; technology and
people; innovation; knowledge,
communication and learning; lifespan,
lifestyles and health; and social inclusion and
exclusion.
The Council has made significant
investments in the area of innovation,
organisations and business processes,
launching three new centres in 1996-97: the
Centre for Research ort Innovation and
Competition, in Manchester; the Centre for
Organisation and Innovation at the University
of Sheffield; and the Complex Product
Systems Innovation Research Centre at the
Universities of Sussex and Brighton.
Council for the Central Laboratory of the
Research Councils
The CCLRC promotes scientific and
engineering research by providing facilities
and technical expertise primarily to meet the
needs of the other Research Councils. Its R &
D budget for 1997-98 is £110 million, of
339
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
which £86 million comes through agreements
with other Research Councils and the
remaining £24 million from contracts and
agreements with the EU, overseas countries,
and other industries and organisations. It
covers a broad range of science and
technology, including materials and biological
science using accelerators and lasers, satellite
instrumentation and data processing, remote¬
sensing, electronics, sensor technology,
computing and informatics, micro¬
engineering and particle physics.
The CCLRC is responsible for three
research establishments: the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory at Chilton in
Oxfordshire; the Daresbury Laboratory near
Warrington in Cheshire; and the Chilbolton
Observatory in Hampshire. These centres
provide facilities too large or complex to be
housed by individual academic institutions.
Among the facilities are ISIS (the world’s
leading source of pulsed neutrons and
muons), some of the world’s brightest lasers
and the United Kingdom Synchrotron
Radiation Source.
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
Universities carry out most of Britain’s long¬
term strategic and basic research in science
and technology. The higher education funding
councils in England, Scotland and Wales (see
p. 452) provide the main general funds to
support research in universities and other
higher education institutions in Great Britain.
These funds pay for the salaries of permanent
academic staff, who usually teach as well as
undertake research, and contribute to the
infrastructure for research. In Northern
Ireland academic institutions are funded by
the Department of Education for Northern
Ireland. The quality of research performance
is a key element in the allocation of funding.
In 1996 the funding councils carried out a
research assessment exercise to assess the
quality of research in each subject across all
higher education institutions in Britain.
Basic and strategic research in higher
education institutions are also financed by the
Research Councils. Institutions undertaking
research with the support of Research Council
grants have the rights over the commercial
exploitation of their research, subject to the
prior agreement of the sponsoring Research
Council. They may make use of technology
transfer experts and other specialists, such as
BTG, to help exploit and license commercially
the results of their research. The other main
channels of support are industry, charities,
government departments and the European
Union. Institutions are expected to recover the
full cost of commissioned research. The high
quality of research in higher education
institutions, and their marketing skills, have
enabled them to attract more funding from a
larger range of external sources, especially in
contract income from industry and charities.
Measures are being taken to improve the
quality of research training and to make it
more relevant to the needs of both students
and industry. For instance, pilot schemes for
two new qualifications, the engineering
doctorate (EngDoc) and the research masters
degree (MRes), have been introduced.
Science Parks
Science parks are partnerships between higher
education or research centres and industry to
promote commercially focused research and
advanced technology. There are around 50
such parks, hosting more than 1,300
companies. The majority are engaged in
computing, biotechnology, chemicals,
electrical engineering and robotics.
Technology transfer and R & D are the most
common activities, rather than large-scale
Microsoft of the United States, the world’s
leading computer software company, plans
to construct a £50 million research facility
in Cambridge, to be headed by Professor
Roger Needham. Cambridge scientists
have been at the forefront of electronics
from the initial discovery of the electron
by J.J. Thomson at the beginning of the
century and the beginnings of transistors
and integrated circuits through to the birth
of nano-technology, which deals with even
smaller components.
340
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
manufacturing. A growing number of
universities offer industry interdisciplinary
research centres, with exploitable resources.
These include access to analytical equipment,
library facilities and worldwide databases as
well as academic expertise.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Industrial Research and Technology
Organisations
Research and Technology Organisations
(RTOs) are independent organisations
carrying out commercially relevant research
and other services on behalf of industry,
often relating to a specific industrial sector.
Britain has the largest RTO sector in Europe,
consisting of around 50 organisations, which
together employ almost 10,000 people.
Charitable Organisations
Medical research charities are a major source of
funds for biomedical research in Britain. Their
combined contribution in 1997-98 will be about
£440 million. The three largest are the Wellcome
Trust—the world’s biggest medical charity—
with a contribution of £250 million, the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund (£53 million) and the
Cancer Research Campaign (£47 million).
Professional Institutions
There are numerous technical institutions,
professional associations and learned societies
in Britain, many of which promote their own
disciplines or the education and professional
well-being of their members. The Council of
Science and Technology Institutes has ten
member institutes representing biology,
biochemistry, chemistry, environment, food
science and technology, geology, hospital
physics and physics.
The Engineering Council promotes the
study of all types of engineering in schools and
other organisations, in co-operation with its
200 industry affiliates, which include large
private sector companies and government
departments. Together with 39 professional
engineering institutions, the Council accredits
courses in higher education institutions. It also
advises the Government on academic,
industrial and professional issues.
Royal Society
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, is
Britain’s academy of science and has some
1,200 Fellows and 100 Foreign Members.
Many of its Fellows serve on governmental
advisory councils and committees concerned
with research. The Society has a dual role, as
the national academy of science and as the
provider of a range of services, including
research fellowships and grants, for the
scientific community. It also offers
independent advice to government on science
matters, acts as a forum for discussion of
scientific issues and fosters public awareness
of science and science education. Its estimated
net expenditure on science and technology in
1997-98 is £25 million.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Royal Academy of Engineering,
which has 1,060 Fellows. It promotes
excellence in engineering for the benefit of
society, and advises government, Parliament
and other official organisations. The
Academy’s programmes are aimed at
attracting first-class students into engineering,
raising awareness of the importance of
engineering design among undergraduates,
developing links between industry and higher
education, and increasing industrial
investment in engineering research in higher
education institutions. Net expenditure on
engineering in 1997-98 will be approximately
£11 million.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
offering postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and
publishing journals. It has been engaged with
Scottish Enterprise in developing a strategy to
341
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
increase the extent of commercial use of the
products of the Scottish research base (see p.
334), and has been active in the Foresight
process. It also acts as a source of
independent scientific advice to the
Government and others.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments by means of lectures
and publications for specialists and
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science
(BAAS), founded in 1831, is mainly
concerned with science, while the Royal
Society of Arts, dating from 1754, deals with
the arts and commerce as well as science. The
Royal Institution, which was founded in
1799, also performs these functions and runs
its own research laboratories.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London, an
independent conservation, science and
education body founded in 1826, runs
London Zoo, which occupies about 15
hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London.
It also runs Whipsnade Wild Animal Park
(243 hectares/600 acres) near Dunstable in
Bedfordshire. The Society is responsible for
the Institute of Zoology, which carries out
research in support of conservation. The
Institute’s work covers topics such as
ecology, behaviour, reproductive biology and
conservation genetics. The Society also
operates in field conservation and
consultancy, and is concerned with practical
field conservation, primarily in East and
Southern Africa, the Middle East and parts
of Asia. Other well-known zoos in Britain
include those in Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester,
Dudley and Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded
in 1759, covers 121 hectares (300 acres) at
Kew in south-west London and a 187-hectare
(462-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place,
Ardingly, in West Sussex. They contain one
of the largest collections of living and dried
plants in the world. Research is conducted
into all aspects of plant life, including
physiology, biochemistry, genetics, economic
botany and the conservation of habitats and
species. In 1997-98 Kew is to build the
Millennium Commission Seed Bank
containing the world’s most comprehensive
collection of plants at Wakehurst Place. The
Millennium Commission is donating up to
£30 million towards the estimated £75-£80
million cost of the project. Staff are also
active in programmes to return endangered
plant species to the wild. Kew participates in
joint research programmes in some 52
countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh
was originally established in 1670, and is the
national botanic garden of Scotland.
Together with its three associated specialist
gardens which were acquired to provide a
range of different climatic and soil
conditions, it has since become an
internationally recognised centre for
taxonomy (classification of species); the
conservation and study of living and
preserved plants and fungi; and as a provider
of horticultural education.
A national botanic garden and research
centre for Wales is to be developed on a 230-
hectare (570-acre) site on the Middleton Hall
estate at Llandeilo, near Swansea. The £43
million project is backed by a consortium of
public and private organisations and
individuals. It has been awarded £21.7
million by the Millennium Commission.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum in South
Kensington, London has 68 million
specimens, ranging from a blue whale
skeleton to minute insects. It is one of the
world’s principal centres for research into
natural history, offering an advisory service
to institutions all over the world. The
Science Museum, also in South Kensington,
promotes understanding of the history of
science, technology, industry and medicine.
Its extensive collection of scientific
instruments and machinery is complemented
by interactive computer games and audio¬
visual equipment for visitors to use. In this
way, the museum explains scientific
principles to the general public and
documents the history of science, from early
discoveries to space age technology. Other

Britain pursues policies of sustainable development and engages fully in
international co-operation on matters of environmental protection. It develops
much of its legislation on pollution control and the conservation of wildlife in
collaboration with its partners in the European Union (EU) and bodies such as
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and
the United Nations (UN). The built environment is protected by the
designation of conservation areas and the listing of buildings of interest.
The Departments of the Environment and of
Transport were merged in June 1997 to form a
single Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR—see also
chapter 19). The Government believes that this
new ‘super-ministry’ will be able to tackle
environmental issues and sustainable
development in a more integrated way. In
addition, the other major government
departments each have a ‘Green Minister’ who
looks after the environmental dimension to
their own department’s area of responsibility.
Sustainable Development
The aim of sustainable development is to
meet the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations
to meet their own needs. Britain’s strategy on
sustainable development was first published in
1994, as one of the documents that arose from
the Rio de Janeiro ‘earth summit’ in 1992 (the
United Nations Conference on Environment
and Development—UNCED). The new
Government intends to revise this strategy to
reflect its overall aim of combining economic
and social goals with environmental
sustainability, and to provide a more practical
framework for sustainable development.
The most recent follow-up report on
sustainable development—This Common
Inheritance: UK Annual Report 1997—was
published in February 1997. It describes
progress made during 1996 towards meeting
about 650 commitments specified in earlier
reports and in the original 1994 strategy
344
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
document. It also sets out priorities for action
in 1997. These include implementing the new
National Air Quality Strategy (see p. 353);
increasing international protection of the
oceans, fish stocks and other marine resources;
and providing better information for
consumers about the environmental impacts of
the goods they buy.
At the United Nations Special Session on
the Environment and Sustainable
Development in New York in June 1997
(‘earth summit 2’), the Government
committed itself to reversing the recent
gradual decline in the flow of British aid to
developing countries, especially those in
Africa, and to concentrating its aid efforts
on combating world poverty. It also set the
target of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions in Britain to 20 per cent below
their 1990 levels by 2010, through more
efficient use of transport, improved energy
conservation and greater use of renewable
sources of energy.
Under the Government’s national strategy
on sustainable development, four bodies were
set up to help formulate policy in this area:
• The Government Panel on Sustainable
Development, an independent panel
which advises on issues of major strategic
importance to sustainable development;
• UK Round Table on Sustainable
Development, which brings together
interests such as business, local
government and academics to discuss
these matters with government ministers;
• Going for Green, an independent
committee which seeks to persuade
. individuals and groups to commit
themselves to sustainable development
(in Scotland, this role is taken by
‘Forward Scotland’); and
• The Secretary of State for Scotland’s
Advisory Group on Sustainable
Development, which published its first
report in August 1997.
In January 1997 the Government Panel on
Sustainable Development published its third
annual report. This identified four main issues
which the Panel considered needed higher
priority: official procurement policy;
government subsidies; climate change and
long-term energy supplies; and the impact of
agriculture on biodiversity. For example, the
Panel called on the Government to make the
environmental dimension more central to its
own procurement policies (government
guidance on this subject was published in July
1997). Likewise, it advised the Government to
draw up new aims and principles for the use of
subsidies, with the same purpose in mind.
The UK Round Table on Sustainable
Development consists of about 30 members,
drawn from central and local government,
business, environmental organisations and
other sectors of the community. It was
established in 1995, originally for two years,
but will now continue until at least 1999. Its
second annual report, issued in March 1997,
draws together conclusions from its first two
years’ work. Much of the Round Table’s
business is carried out in subgroups, set up to
consider specific topics. For example, the
second annual report summarises and includes
recommendations on five recently completed
topics:
• ‘Making Connections’ (overcoming the
barriers to transfers within passenger and
freight journeys, and trying to make such
journeys as attractive as door-to-door car
and lorry trips);
• ‘Getting Round Town’(looking at
obstacles to sustainable transport policies:
a case study based in the Northampton
area);
• ‘Housing and Urban Capacity’
(recommending a target of 75 per cent of
new housing to be built on previously
developed land);
• ‘Freshwater’ (looking at the national
water resource from the perspective of
sustainable development); and
• ‘Energy and Planning’ (a study of land
use planning controls over energy
developments, especially power stations
and renewable energy projects).
Going for Green has been established as a
private company, and from April 1996 it took
345
THE ENVIRONMENT
responsibility for a campaign which aims to
promote sustainable development to the
general public. In 1996-97, the Government
provided £1.5 million of funding, with £0.7
million subject to matching funding from the
private sector. Among its recent activities have
been a study to see how the message of waste
minimisation can best be transmitted to the
public, and the relaunch of the ‘Green Code’.
The Code outlines five ‘green’ goals—cutting
down waste, saving energy and natural
resources, travelling sensibly, preventing
pollution, and looking after the local
environment—and explains how they can be
achieved on an individual basis.
Indicators of Sustainable Development
Indicators of Sustainable Development for the
United Kingdom was published in 1996. It lists
118 indicators, grouped into 21 broad
headings. The broad headings are: the
economy; transport use; leisure and tourism;
overseas trade; energy; land use; water
resources; forestry; fish resources; climate
change; ozone layer depletion; acid deposition;
air; freshwater quality; marine; wildlife and
habitats; land cover and landscape; soil;
minerals extraction; waste; and radioactivity.
Where possible, the indicators track trends
over the last 20 to 25 years. They are already
making a major contribution to the
measurement of progress in attaining
sustainable development, and are helping to
inform the Government, business and the
public about the ways in which the
environment is changing and how these
changes are linked to economic development.
Business and Consumer Involvement
The Government has launched a number of
initiatives designed to help business improve
its environmental performance, ensure
business concerns are taken into account when
policy is made, and help consumers assess
firms’ environmental credentials. For
example, the Environmental Technology Best
Practice Programme encourages British
industry and commerce to adopt the best
environmental technology, and to give greater
attention to waste minimisation. The
Government’s contribution to the Programme
amounts to £32 million over the eight years to
2001-2. Other initiatives include the Energy
Efficiency Best Practice Programme (which is
aimed at, among others, those responsible for
industrial production and processes) and the
Small Company Environmental and Energy
Management Assistance Scheme
(SCEEMAS—see p. 259).
Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment
The Advisory Committee on Business and the
Environment is made up of business leaders,
appointed by the Government and serving in a
personal capacity. Its roles are:
• to advise the Government on
environmental issues of concern to
business;
• to provide a link with international
business initiatives on the environment;
and
• to help mobilise the business community
through demonstrating good
environmental practice.
In February 1997, the Committee published
guidance for business on good practice in
environrpental reporting, which showed how
business can benefit from greater openness
about its environmental performance.
Standards bn Environmental Management
In 1992 the British Standards Institution (see
p. 194) published BS 7750, the world’s first
standard for environmental management
systems. Since then an international set of
standards based on the British standard has
come into operation, one of which, ISO
14001, has now superseded BS 7750. ISO
14001 allows organisations to evaluate how
their activities, products and services affect
the environment, and gives them a structure
through which they can achieve
improvements in overall environmental
performance.
The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme
(EMAS) is a voluntary scheme for individual
346
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
industrial sites, which was established by EU
law in April 1995. EMAS and ISO 14001 are
complementary systems, the main difference
between them (apart from restrictions on
eligibility for EMAS) being the requirement
under EMAS for a published environmental
management statement. This statement
provides the public with independently
validated information on the organisation’s
environmental performance. To date, nearly
40 organisations in Britain are registered to
EMAS, including Vauxhall, Woodcote
Industries, Ciba Clayton and the London
Borough of Sutton (under the British
extension of the scheme to local government).
Government grants are available to help small
businesses meet the cost of employing
environmental experts to assist with
registration.
Ecolabelling
Increasingly, consumers wish to take
environmental considerations into account
when buying goods. Britain has played a
leading role in developing the EU ecolabelling
scheme. This voluntary scheme aims to help
consumers identify those products which are
less harmful to the environment over their
whole lifecycle, from raw materials and
manufacture to final disposal. In 1993 Britain
awarded the first European ecolabels to
Hoover for washing machines in its ‘New
Wave’ range. Since then, other products have
started to carry labels, including brands of
kitchen towel and toilet paper (Nouvelle and
Co-Op), and paints. Environmental criteria
have been agreed for a number of other
product groups, such as laundry detergents,
copying paper and refrigerators.
There is also a Europe-wide energy label
scheme, which rates the energy-efficiency
performance of ‘white goods’ such as
refrigerators. The manufacturers themselves
are responsible for the accuracy of these labels.
Most products, however, still lie outside
these schemes. In February 1997, the
Government published a Consultation Paper,
Green Claims, which seeks to improve the
quality of environmental information given to
consumers by proposing a code of practice on
the making of‘green claims’ for products.
Often such claims are confusing, and the
Government hopes that the establishment of
ground rules will help consumers to make
better-informed environmental choices about
the products they buy.
Research into environmental protection is
essential to the formulation of the
Government’s environmental policies. Several
government departments—such as the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
and The Scottish Office—have substantial
research programmes. The Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions has
allocated nearly £29 million for 1997-98 to
research and monitoring in the following eight
broad areas:
• the global atmosphere (climate change
and depletion of the ozone layer);
• air quality and emissions;
• noise as an environmental pollutant;
• chemicals and biotechnology (including
pesticides and genetically modified
organisms);
• radioactive substances (both man-made
and natural);
• water and land (including water quality
and health, marine quality and
contaminated land);
• waste policy; and
• economics and statistics.
Among the most important non-departmental
official bodies that carry out research in this
area are the Meteorological Office (including
the Hadley Centre—see p. 354), and the
Environment Agency (see p. 348), whose
R & D budget for 1997-98 is £12.3 million,
including £2.5 million on water pollution
control. The Natural Resources Institute in
Chatham, Kent, also has an important role in
environmental research, as do many of Britain’s
universities. The Climatic Research Unit at the
University of East Anglia is regarded by many
as the most important of its kind in the world.
Nearly 100 British universities and colleges run
courses on environmental studies or natural
resource management.
Environmental Research
347
THE ENVIRONMENT
Research Councils
Basic and strategic research is carried out by
government-funded research councils (see pp.
337^-0). Most have a role in environmental
protection research, but the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC) is
particularly important. It has a Science Budget
allocation of £166.6 million in 1997-98, plus
about £43 million from other sources. NERC
undertakes and supports research in the
environmental sciences and funds
postgraduate training. Its programmes
encompass the marine, earth, terrestrial,
freshwater, polar and atmospheric sciences,
and science-based archaeology. NERC puts
particular emphasis on international
collaborative work on global environmental
issues.
One of the research projects funded by
NERC has resulted in a new way of
tracking how wild salmon use landmarks
and environmental cues to orient
themselves, find food and shelter, and
respond to droughts or floods. The
implications for better management of wild
salmon fisheries are considerable.
The research, carried out by the
University of Glasgow and Freshwater
Fisheries Lab, Pitlochry, has also
produced an unexpected application in
aquaculture. The discovery that landmarks
are used in setting up territories has
suggested a new way to reduce aggression
in farmed salmon.
Pollution Control
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. Central
government makes policy, promotes
legislation and advises pollution control
authorities on policy implementation.
In England, the Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions has
general responsibility for co-ordinating the
work of the Government on environmental
protection. In Scotland and Wales, the
respective Secretaries of State are responsible
for co-ordinating pollution control. In
Northern Ireland, responsibility rests with the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland—DOENI.
Local authorities also have important duties
and powers. They are responsible for such
matters as:
• collection and disposal of domestic
wastes;
• keeping the streets clear of litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic
and from many industrial premises; and
• noise and general nuisance abatement.
The Environment Agency for England and
Wales (EA) is a non-departmental public body
that combines the functions of the former
National Rivers Authority, Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Pollution and the local waste
regulation authorities. Through the
mechanism of ‘integrated pollution control’
(IPC—see below), it has a central role in the
control of particular industrial emissions to
land, air and water. Other discharges to water
are subject to discharge consents (see p. 350).
The Scottish Environment Protection
Agency (SEPA) combines the functions
formerly carried out by Her Majesty’s
Industrial Pollution Inspectorate and the
Scottish river purification authorities. Waste
regulation and some air pollution functions of
the unitary local authorities have also been
taken over by SEPA. In Northern Ireland, the
Environment and Heritage Service, an
executive agency of DOENI, exercises
pollution control functions relating to
emissions to land, water and air.
An independent standing body, the Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution,
advises the Government. It has produced 20
reports on a variety of topics, the last two
being on the sustainable use of soil, and on
transport and the environment.
Integrated Pollution Control
Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) is applied
to certain categories of industrial pollution.
The potentially most harmful processes are
348
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
;pecified for IPC and require authorisation
Vom the EA, in England and Wales,
emissions to air from more minor processes
ire controlled by local authorities under a
jarallel system of local air pollution control
EAPC). In granting authorisation for releases
inder IPC, the EA requires the use of the best
ivailable techniques, not entailing excessive
:ost, to prevent or minimise polluting
emissions and to ensure that any releases are
nade harmless.
In Scotland, IPC and EAPC are
idministered by SEPA. In Northern Ireland
troadly similar controls are exercised by the
environment and Heritage Service, and
proposals have been formulated for the
ntroduction of a system of pollution control
;imilar to IPC in 1998.
A new EC Integrated Pollution and
Prevention and Control (IPPC) directive will
greatly extend the scope of IPC, both in the
lumber of installations and processes covered,
tnd in the range of environmental impacts that
vill need to be considered before a permit is
ssued. Britain is committed to implementing
he directive by the end of 1999.
Land and Waste
Lertain local authorities are designated as
vaste collection and/or waste disposal
mthorities, responsible for different parts of
he process of dealing with wastes that are
iubject to specific controls. Waste regulation,
ormerly a local authority responsibility, now
ests with the EA, SEPA and, with the
mplementation of new legislation, with the
environment and Heritage Service in
Northern Ireland. A licensing system
egulates waste disposal sites, treatment plants
ind storage facilities receiving controlled
vastes. ‘Special’—that is, hazardous—wastes
ire subject to additional controls, which have
teen tightened by new regulations that came
nto force in 1996. Responsibility for proper
tandling of waste falls on everyone who has
:ontrol of it from production to final disposal
>r reclamation. Operators of landfill sites
emain responsible for them, even after
closure, until the EA is satisfied that no future
tazard is likely to arise.
In Scotland, the new unitary councils (see
p. 22) are responsible for the collection and
disposal of refuse, with SEPA acting as waste
regulation authority for both the public and
private sectors. In Northern Ireland,
responsibility for the collection, disposal and
regulation of waste currently rests with the
district councils. However, proposed
legislative changes will centralise waste
regulation.
In 1995-96, the Department of the
Environment estimated that 26 million
tonnes of waste was collected by local
authorities in England and Wales. A little
over 90 per cent of this waste came from
households. Only 6.5 per cent of
household waste was separately collected
for recycling and composting.
In the case of municipal waste, 83 per
cent was reported as disposed of to landfill
sites, 12 per cent had value recovered from
it through recycling, composting or energy
recovery, and the remaining 5 per cent was
incinerated without any energy recovery.
There is still some way to go to achieve
the targets set out in the waste strategy
White Paper issued in 1995, Making Waste
Work:
• to recycle or compost 25 per cent of
household waste by 2000;
• to encourage 40 per cent of homes
with a garden to carry out home
composting by 2000;
• to recover value from 40 per cent of
municipal waste by 2005; and
• to reduce the proportion of controlled
waste going to landfill sites to 60 per
cent by 2005.
The Government introduced a landfill tax
in October 1996, which provided a tax
incentive for waste minimisation and
recycling. However, it may also lead to ‘fly
tipping’ of waste, as an illegal way of avoiding
the tax. A co-operative exercise is therefore
planned between the environment agencies,
local authorities and the Tidy Britain Group
(the national agency for tackling litter) to
survey the incidence of fly tipping since the
349
THE ENVIRONMENT
introduction of the tax. A report will be
published in the first half of 1998.
There is an ongoing programme of
government financial support for capital costs
incurred by local authorities and the
environment agencies in the investigation and
‘remediation’ of contaminated land (including
old landfill sites), so that it can be brought
back into use. In 1996-97, £14 million was
allocated, covering over 230 projects.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The reclamation and recycling of waste
materials is encouraged whenever this is the
best practicable environmental option. Local
authorities are obliged to make plans for the
recycling of waste. Waste disposal authorities
in England must pay ‘recycling credits’ to
waste collection authorities when they collect
and return household waste for recycling.
These credits are based on savings in disposal
costs that have been avoided. In Wales and
Scotland, the same authorities handle waste
collection and disposal, so that the need for
payments does not arise.
Under the EC directive on packaging and
packaging wastes, at least 50 per cent of
Britain’s packaging waste must be re-utilised
through recycling and other recovery methods
by the year 2001. Meanwhile, the newspaper
industry has already exceeded a voluntary
target of using 40 per cent of recycled content
in British newspapers.
The general public can deposit used glass
containers in bottle banks for recycling. There
were 15,000 bottle bank sites in Britain by
1995, 1,400 steel can banks and 8,700 can
banks accepting aluminium cans. A variety of
other materials, such as textiles, paper and
plastics, are also recycled. One of the
Government’s waste strategy targets is to have
easily accessible recycling facilities for 80 per
cent of households by 2000.
Litter and Dog Fouling
Under the Environmental Protection Act
1990, it is a criminal offence to leave litter in
any public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The litter
fixed penalty fine was increased from £10 to
£25 in January 1997, and the maximum fine
for a prosecution is £2,500 under the Dogs
(Fouling of Land) Act 1996. Local authorities
have a duty to keep their public land free of
litter and refuse, including dog faeces, as far as
is practicable. Members of the public have
powers to take action against authorities which
fail to comply with their responsibilities. Local
authorities also have powers to make it an
offence not to clear up after one’s dog in
specified places. In Scotland outdoor venues
which host events that attract large numbers
of people are now obliged to clear up all litter
within twelve hours.
In 1997-98, the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
allocated £2.7 million to the Tidy Britain
Group, which provides a comprehensive anti¬
litter programme in collaboration with local
authorities and the private sector. In a 1995
survey, the Group found that 90 per cent of
littering offences recorded by the police were
committed by males, most of whom were
teenagers.
Water
All discharges to water in Britain require the
consent of the appropriate regulatory
authority. In England and Wales the EA’s
principal method of controlling water
pollution is through the regulation of all
effluent discharges into groundwaters, inland
and coastal waters. The EA maintains public
registers containing information about water
quality, discharge consents, authorisations and
monitoring. Applicants for consents to
discharge have the right of appeal if they are
dissatisfied with the EA’s decision; most of
these appeals are dealt with by the Planning
Inspectorate. In Scotland control is exercised
by SEPA. In Northern Ireland the
• Environment and Heritage Service is
responsible for controlling water pollution.
The Government introduced regulations
for a new system of classifying water quality in
England and Wales in 1994. This provides the
basis for setting statutory water quality
objectives (SWQOs), which will specify for
each individual stretch of water the standards
that should be reached and the target date for
achieving them. In 1996 the EA began
350
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
consultations on eight pilot SWQOs to see if
they can be successfully extended to other
water catchment areas.
More than 95 per cent of the population in
Britain live in properties connected to a sewer,
and sewage treatment works serve over 80 per
cent of the population. In England and Wales,
the water industry is committed to an
investment programme of some ^11,000
million over ten years for improvements to
water quality. Progressively higher treatment
standards for industrial waste effluents and
new measures to combat pollution from
agriculture are expected to bring further
improvements in water quality. In Scotland,
responsibility for the provision of all water and
sewerage services lies with three Water and
Sewerage Authorities, covering the north, east
and west of the country.
Over the past 30 years, notable progress has
been made in cleaning up the previously
heavily polluted major estuaries of the east
coast of Britain, including the Forth, Tees,
Thames and Tyne. In 1995, the chemical
quality of 91 per cent of rivers and canals in
England and Wales was graded as ‘good’ or
‘fair’ under the EA’s General Quality
Assessment scheme. Nearly 88 per cent of
Northern Ireland’s freshwater rivers were
graded ‘good’ or ‘fair’ under the same scheme,
and in Scotland, under a different scheme, 99
per cent of rivers or canals were graded as
‘unpolluted’ or of‘fairly good’ quality.
There are currently 68 designated Nitrate
Vulnerable Zones in England and Wales,
whose aim is to protect water against pollution
caused by nitrates used in agriculture.
Another risk to water quality comes from
pollution from water in abandoned coal and
other mines, although the scale of the problem
is comparatively small—only 1.5 per cent of
the total river length monitored by the EA is
affected by such discharges. In 1996, the EA
and the Coal Authority identified for further
study a priority list of 35 serious mine water
discharges from abandoned coal mines in
England and Wales which need remedial
pollution treatment, and which are being
monitored by the EA during 1997. Following
discussions with the EA and SEPA, the Coal
Authority has undertaken 14 detailed
feasibility studies on the most environmentally
damaging discharges and allocated over £2
million principally to tackle four priority sites
during 1997-98.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage Discharges
The water industry is investing roughly
£2,000 million to provide treatment of coastal
sewage discharges and improve the quality of
Britain’s bathing waters. In the 1996 tests of
bathing water quality, 90 per cent of identified
bathing waters (423 out of 472) in Britain met
the mandatory bacteria standards of the EC
bathing water directive, compared with 80 per
cent of beaches in 1993, and 66 per cent in
1988. The current programme of
improvements to bathing waters is set to
continue so that the remaining problems can
be identified and put right.
The Tidy Britain Group publishes a
Seaside Awards booklet which describes
Britain’s award-winning beaches (there were
224 in 1997). All seaside award beaches are
regularly assessed for cleanliness and safety,
and to ensure that the bathing water complies
with current EU legislation.
Marine Environment
An international Convention for the
Protection of the Marine Environment of the
North East Atlantic was agreed in 1992. It
covers inputs and discharges of harmful
substances from both land and sea, sets targets
for the introduction of additional safeguards
for the area, and requires parties to the
Convention to take all possible steps to
prevent or eliminate pollution. Britain is also a
leading participant in the series of North Sea
Conferences, the most recent of which was
held in Denmark in 1995. Good progress is
being made in meeting North Sea Conference
targets for reducing the input of hazardous
substances into the sea. For example, direct
and riverine inputs of lead and mercury to
coastal waters were reduced by 75 and 77 per
cent respectively between 1985 and 1995.
The Marine Pollution Control Unit
(MPCU), part of the Coastguard Agency (see
p. 315), is responsible for dealing with
spillages of oil or other hazardous substances
351
THE ENVIRONMENT
Emissions of Carbon Dioxide
million tonnes
Source: Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions
from ships at sea. The MPCU has various
counter-pollution facilities, including: remote¬
sensing surveillance aircraft; aerial and
seaborne spraying equipment; stocks of oil
dispersants; mechanical recovery and cargo
transfer equipment; and specialised beach
cleaning equipment.
The Government’s national contingency
plan details arrangements for dealing with
pollution. The plan is currently being
reviewed in consultation with all interested
parties and will, among other things, take
account of the lessons learned from the
grounding of the tanker Sea Empress off south
Wales in 1996. The review is due to be
completed in 1998.
Licences for oil and gas exploration include
special conditions designed to protect the
environment. These conditions are agreed
with the Joint Nature Conservation
Committee (see p. 359). Applicants for
licences must demonstrate that they have
addressed environmental concerns when
developing their work programme. Draft
regulations to implement the EC
environmental impact assessment directive for
offshore oil and gas activities were issued for
consultation in August 1997 and are likely to
be brought into force before the end of the
year.
Before starting offshore operations,
operators are required to have approved oil
spill contingency plans in place. In addition,
all discharges that contain oil are controlled by
legislation, and limits are specified for the
permissible level of oil discharged. In response
to commitments made at the North Sea
Conferences, progressively tighter limits on oil
discharged with drill cuttings have been set,
which have resulted in an effective ban on
their discharge from January 1997. The
quantity of oil discharges from this source
from installations in British waters fell from
18,500 tonnes in 1988 to 3,180 tonnes in 1995.
Britain ended the dumping of industrial
waste at sea in 1992, and waste has not been
licensed for incineration at sea since 1990. The
disposal at sea of most other types of waste
will be phased out over the next few years.
Britain has accepted an internationally agreed
indefinite ban on the sea dumping of low- and
intermediate-level radioactive waste—the sea
dumping of high-level waste is also
prohibited. After the phasing out of sewage
sludge dumping in 1998, the only category of
waste which Britain will routinely dispose of
352
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
at sea will be silt dredged from ports, harbours
and the like. Even this will only be approved if
no beneficial use for the material is available.
Air
Air quality in Britain has improved
considerably in the last 30 years. Total
emissions of smoke in the air have fallen by
over 85 per cent since 1960. London and other
major cities no longer have the dense smoke¬
laden fogs, or ‘smogs’, of the 1950s, and in
central London winter sunshine has increased
by about 70 per cent since the late 1950s.
However, there are still some areas of Britain,
most notably parts of Northern Ireland and
some areas associated with coal mining, where
the use of domestic solid fuel is widespread
and contributes to episodes of poor air quality.
Furthermore, new concerns have arisen,
especially over the emissions from the growing
number of motor vehicles, which can produce
summertime smogs that can have an adverse
impact on health. Measures have consequently
been adopted to reduce emissions from road
vehicles (see pp. 355-7).
Industrial processes with the greatest
potential for producing harmful emissions are
controlled under the Environmental
Protection Act 1990—enforced in England
and Wales by the EA, and in Scotland by
SEP A—and are subject to IPC. Processes
with a significant but lesser potential for air
pollution require approval, in England and
Wales from local authorities, and in Scotland
from SEPA. Local authorities also control
emissions of dark smoke from commercial and
industrial premises, and implement smoke
control areas to deal with emissions from
domestic properties. In Northern Ireland,
regulations are in preparation to make illegal
the sale of unauthorised fuel in smoke contol
areas, and to limit the sulphur content of all
domestic solid fuel.
In July 1997, the Government adopted the
National Air Quality Strategy, which had been
published in March. This sets out objectives
for the air pollutants of main concern:
nitrogen dioxide, airborne'particles, ground-
level ozone, sulphur dioxide, carbon
monoxide, lead, benzene and 1,3 butadiene.
The Strategy, the first of its kind in Europe,
sets air quality objectives to be achieved by
2005 and will start being implemented by the
end of 1997.
The Environment Act 1995 places new
duties on local authorities in Great Britain to
review and assess air quality and prepare
remedial action plans where appropriate.
Corresponding legislation will shortly be
prepared for Northern Ireland. The
Government will provide local authorities
with guidance and financial assistance, in
order to enable them to fulfil their new
responsibilities.
Britain has an automatic air quality
monitoring network with sites covering much
of the country, in both urban and rural areas.
It is being extended and upgraded at a cost of
over £4 million a year, while local authority
sites are being integrated into the national
network. The automated urban network
currently includes over 135 sites.
Since 1990, daily Air Quality Bulletins have
made air pollution data from the monitoring
network available to the public. These give the
concentrations of the main pollutants,
together with an air pollution forecast. The
information features in television and radio
weather reports, and appears in many national
and local newspapers. Information, updated
hourly from the automatic monitoring sites, is
also available directly on an interactive free
telephone number, on videotext systems and
on the Internet.
In July 1997 the Government announced a
£1 million research programme to find out
more about the effects of air pollutants
commonly found in the home. Such
pollutants, when combined with air
pollution seeping in from outside sources,
may have adverse health effects. Among
the areas of investigation are the
interactions between tobacco smoke,
allergens and other indoor pollutants; the
relationship between indoor and outdoor
air pollutants; and the health effects of
damp in the home. The key pollutants of
interest are particulate matter, carbon
monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and organic
compounds.
353
THE ENVIRONMENT
Climate Change
Several gases naturally present in the
atmosphere keep the Earth at a temperature
suitable for life by trapping energy from the
sun—the greenhouse effect. Emissions from
human activities are increasing the atmospheric
concentrations of several important greenhouse
gases, which in turn is thought to be leading to
additional global warming. Easily the most
significant greenhouse gas in Britain is carbon
dioxide (C02), followed by methane and
nitrous oxide. Some other gases, such as
hydrofluorocarbons, have high global warming
potential but low levels of emission.
In 1996, the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that the
balance of evidence suggested a discernible
human influence on global climate. It estimated
that between 1990 and 2100 there might be an
increase in global surface temperatures of about
2°C—a greater average rate of warming than
any seen in the last 10,000 years.
Britain is conducting extensive research into
climate change. The research programme
includes the construction of an advanced
climate change detection instrument for launch
on a satellite towards the end of the 1990s, and
the work of the Hadley Centre for Climate
Prediction and Research.
The Framework Convention on Climate
Change was signed by more than 150 nations at
the ‘earth summit’ in Rio de Janeiro (see p.
344). Its objective is to achieve stabilisation of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the
atmosphere at a level which would prevent
dangerous man-made interference with the
climate system. Britain is one of a handful of
developed countries on course to meet its
Convention commitments. By the year 2000,
emissions of C02 are expected to be between 4
and 8 per cent below 1990 levels; emissions of
methane 22 per cent below; and emissions of
nitrous oxide 62 per cent below. This
achievement would reflect the measures in
Britain’s Climate Change Programme, which was
published in 1994 and is based on a partnership
between the Government and those who
contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
The Programme includes:
• the removal of subsidies on the use of
fossil fuels;
• an annual increase in road fuel duties of 5
per cent in real terms (although the July
1997 budget went further than that,
increasing the duty by nearly 7 per
cent—see p. 157), and improved fuel
efficiency in cars;
• the introduction of value added tax on
domestic fuel (although the July 1997
budget reduced the tax from 8 to 5 per
cent);
• the promotion of new and renewable
sources of energy to enable them to
compete in energy markets;
• programmes to improve industrial,
commercial and domestic energy
efficiency; and
• the adoption of EU minimum efficiency
standards for electrical appliances.
Other key factors which have put Britain on
course to exceed its targets are a fall in
emissions of methane from coal mining and
landfill waste; and a 95 per cent cut in
emissions of nitrous oxide from the
manufacture of chemicals used in the
production of nylon (overall levels were 21 per
cent lower in 1995 than in 1990).
In 1995 the first conference of parties to the
Framework Convention met in Berlin and set
in hand a process for agreeing new
commitments for the period beyond 2000.
The resulting ‘Berlin Mandate’ is aimed
primarily at strengthening commitments from
developed nations. Another meeting is due to
be held in Kyoto, Japan, at the end of 1997,
where a protocol should be agreed to fulfil the
Berlin Mandate. The EU is proposing that
developed countries should aim to reduce
their total emissions of a group of greenhouse
gases to at least 7.5 per cent below their 1990
levels by 2005 and 15 per cent below by 2010.
In June 1997, Britain set itself the further
challenge of reducing its own C02 emissions
by 20 per cent by the year 2010.
Stratospheric Ozone Layer
Stratospheric ozone forms a layer of gas about
10 km to 50 km (6 to 30 miles) above the
Earth’s surface, protecting it from the more
harmful effects of solar radiation. However,
354
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
there is evidence for ozone losses over much of
the globe, including a ‘hole’ in the ozone layer
over Antarctica, first discovered by British
scientists in 1985. Over Britain itself, the
ozone layer tends to become thinner in the
spring, and the current trend suggests a
decrease in total ozone of 5 to 6 per cent a
decade. Ozone depletion is caused by man¬
made chemicals containing chlorine or
bromine, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
or halons, which have been used in aerosol
sprays, refrigerators and fire extinguishers.
The Government has made a commitment
to the earliest possible phasing out of all
ozone-depleting substances. Britain was one of
the first 25 signatories to the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, which deals with the protection of
the stratospheric ozone layer. This required
the phasing out of the production of halons by
the end of 1993, and the phasing out of CFCs,
1,1,1 trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride
by the end of 1995 in all developed countries.
This has been substantially achieved in Britain
apart from exemptions for a small number of
essential uses, for example in medical inhalers.
Consumption of CFCs in the EU as a whole in
1995 was 87 per cent lower than in 1994 and 2
per cent of the 1986 level.
The Protocol has also placed controls on
hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which are
transitional substances with much lower
ozone-depleting potential than CFCs. They
are needed in a number of areas to allow
industry to cease using CFCs more quickly,
but must be phased out in new equipment by
2020. Production and consumption of methyl
bromide must be phased out by 2010,
although the EU proposed in Montreal in
September 1997 that consumption of methyl
bromide in developed countries should be
reduced to 50 per cent of 1991 levels by 2001
and phased out in 2005.
The Montreal Protocol also imposes
controls on developing countries, which are
committed to phasing out CFCs by 2010. A
multilateral fund has been established to assist
developing countries to comply with the
controls on ozone-depleting substances;
Britain contributes towards this.
Thanks to international action taken under
the Montreal Protocol, the ozone layer,
though continuing to suffer damage over the
next few years, is expected to begin recovering
within the next decade.
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen
Sulphur dioxide (S02) and oxides of nitrogen
(NOx) are the main gases that lead to acid rain.
The principal sources are combustion plants
that burn fossil fuels, such as coal-fired power
stations, and, for NOx, road vehicles. By the
end of 1995, national S02 emissions had fallen
by 52 per cent since 1980. Under an EC
directive on the control of emissions from
large combustion plants, the Government has
published a National Plan setting out further
phased reductions in emissions from existing
plants: NOx is to be reduced by 30 per cent by
1998; and S02 by 60 per cent by 2003 (in both
cases compared with the level in 1980). The
latest figures, for 1995, show that Britain has
achieved a reduction of 45 per cent for NOx
and 55 per cent for S02 (15 per cent ahead of
the 1998 target level). Britain has also met the
targets set in the first United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)
protocol on NOx, and is currently involved in
development of a new UNECE NOx protocol.
In 1996 it ratified the second UNECE sulphur
protocol, and agreed to secure a reduction of
at least 80 per cent in S02 emissions from all
sources by 2010.
The damaging effect of acid depositions from
combustion processes on freshwaters and soils
has been demonstrated by scientific research.
Lower emissions of S02 over the past 20 years
(see graph on p. 356) have, however, led to the
first signs of a decrease in acidification in some
lochs in south-west Scotland.
Vehicle Emissions
Stringent emission standards for passenger
cars require new petrol-engined cars to be
fitted with catalytic converters. These
typically reduce emissions by over 75 per cent.
Diesel cars are also subject to strict controls on
particulate emissions. Since 1994, vans have
had to meet a limit of equivalent severity to
cars. Stricter controls for heavy diesel
vehicles, including lorries and buses, were
355
THE ENVIRONMENT
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide

introduced in 1993. Further cuts in permitted
emission levels from all vehicles were
introduced in 1996 and 1997.
Compulsory tests of emissions from
vehicles in use are a key element in.Britain’s
strategy for improving air quality. Britain has
introduced metered emission tests and smoke
checks into the annual ‘MoT roadworthiness
test. Limits for vehicles in service were further
tightened in 1995, and special tests have been
applied to catalyst-fitted vehicles from January
1996. Enforcement checks carried out at the
roadside or in operators’ premises also include
at least a visual check for excessive smoke.
Wherever possible, a smoke meter is used for
borderline cases. The Vehicle Inspectorate
(see p. 307) carried out 125,000 roadside
emissions checks in 1996—97 (on cars, coaches,
lorries and buses) and 180,000 roadworthiness
checks. As a result of these measures, a
marked and progressive decline in regulated
pollutants is expected, which will continue
until well into the first decade of the 21st
century.
Sales of unleaded petrol have risen from
virtually nothing in the mid-1980s to about 70
per cent of all petrol sold in 1997. This is due
mainly to:
• a differential in duty between leaded and
unleaded petrol;
• the requirement for all new cars from
. 1990 onwards to be capable of running on
unleaded petrol; and
• the necessity for cars fitted with catalytic
converters to use unleaded petrol.
Emissions of lead from petrol-engined road
vehicles declined from 7,500 tonnes in 1980 to
1,000 tonnes in 1996.
Regulations introduced in 1994 set
compulsory limits to the volatility of petrol for
the first time. In 1996 the former Department
of the Environment issued guidance on
controlling air pollution when storing, loading
and unloading petrol at terminals, and
unloading petrol into storage at petrol stations.
The Government is also consulting on new
measures that will reduce the levels of
pollutants emitted during refuelling of petrol
vehicles at petrol stations. These initiatives
should substantially reduce the emission of
volatile organic compounds contained in
petrol vapour.
The 1994 regulations also brought in a new
EU standard for low sulphur diesel fuel,
which has further reduced particulate
356
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
emissions from all diesel vehicles from 1996.
In addition, the Government has introduced,
from August 1997, a duty differential of Ip
per litre between ultra low sulphur diesel and
conventional diesel fuel.
For a description of the new Government’s
proposed integrated transport policy, designed
to encourage the wider use of alternative
forms of transport to road vehicles, see
chapter 19.
Internationally developed standards have
been implemented in Britain to control the
emission of smoke and unburned
hydrocarbons from civil aircraft. International
standards to control NOx and carbon
monoxide will be incorporated into domestic
legislation.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for noise nuisance from premises and
vehicles, machinery or equipment in the
street, and to investigate complaints. They
must serve a noise abatement notice where the
noise is judged to be a statutory nuisance.
They can also designate noise abatement
zones, within which registered levels of noise
from certain premises may not be increased
without their permission. There are also
specific provisions in law to:
• control noise from construction and
demolition sites;
• control the use of loudspeakers in the
streets; and
• enable individuals to take independent
action through the courts against noise
nuisance.
The Government believes that, wherever
possible, attempts should be made to resolve
problems informally. It promotes increased
public awareness of neighbour noise issues and
also encourages the use of community
mediation, funding an umbrella organisation,
Mediation UK. However, informal resolution
is not always possible. The Noise Act 1996
strengthens the law in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland on action that can be taken
against noisy neighbours. For example, local
authorities can seize noise-making equipment
and may also enforce a discretionary new night
noise offence. In addition, the Housing Act
1996 (see chapter 23) gives them new powers
to deal with anti-social behaviour by tenants,
which includes noise nuisance. Complaints
made to Environmental Health Officers in
local authorities in England and Wales about
noise from domestic premises increased by
almost 300 per cent between 1983-84 and
1994-95.
Regulations set out the permissible noise
levels for various classes of new vehicle, and a
new EC noise directive was implemented in
Britain in 1996. Compensation may be payable
for loss in property values caused by physical
factors, including noise from new or improved
public works such as roads, railways and
airports. Highway authorities are required to
make grants available for insulation of homes
that would be subject to specified levels of
increased noise caused by new or improved
roads. Noise insulation may also be provided
where construction work for new roads will
seriously affect nearby homes for a substantial
period of time. Equivalent regulations have
been introduced for new railways.
Britain has played a leading role in
negotiations aimed at phasing out older,
noisier subsonic jet aircraft. The phased
implementation of a complete ban on the
operation of‘Chapter 2’ aircraft (noisier
planes, as classified by international
agreement) began in 1995, and it is intended
to phase out all these types by 2002. Various
operational restrictions have been introduced
to reduce noise disturbance further at
London’s Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted
airports. These measures include:
• restrictions on the type and number of
aircraft operating at night;
• the routeing of departing aircraft to
minimise noise nuisance; and
• quieter take-off and landing procedures.
The Government has introduced a control
system for night flights combining a noise
quota with a ceiling on the total number of
movements. The population disturbed by
aircraft noise' at Heathrow airport fell from
1 That is, living within the 57 Leq noise contour, which is
generally regarded as the onset of disturbance.
357
THE ENVIRONMENT
591,000 in 1988 to 319,000 in 1994, even
though the number of air transport
movements increased. This was largely
because of the phasing out of older, noisier
aircraft.
‘Light pollution’ is becoming more widely
acknowledged as a problem that needs to
be addressed. It is felt that the
intrusiveness of artificial light at night,
particularly in rural areas, needs to be kept
to a minimum, not just because of the
nuisance value to humans, but because it
disrupts the natural rhythms of the
countryside and shuts out the clear night
skies. The Government is currently
considering ways of raising public
awareness of the issue, and, in July 1997, it
published a good practice guide for
lighting in the countryside.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents only a small
fraction—about 15 per cent—of what the
population is exposed to; most occurs
naturally. A large proportion of the man-made
radioactivity comes from medical treatments,
such as X-rays. Nevertheless, man-made
radiation is subject to stringent control. Users
of radioactive materials must be registered by
the EA in England and Wales and its
equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Authorisation is also required for the
accumulation and disposal of radioactive
waste. The Health and Safety Executive
(HSE—see p. 185), through its Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate, is responsible for
granting nuclear site licences for major nuclear
installations. No installation may be
constructed or operated without a licence
granted by the HSE.
In 1987 the Government first announced
measures to deal with the problem of radon, a
naturally occurring radioactive gas which can
accumulate in houses, and which accounts for
half of the total average population radiation
dose. The measures included a free survey by
the National Radiological Protection Board
(NRPB) for householders living in areas
mostly likely to be affected by radon
—Cornwall, Devon, Somerset,
Northamptonshire and Derbyshire. Since
then, other areas with an above-average
number of houses likely to be affected by
radon have been identified. As a result of
earlier surveys, the NRPB can now predict
with much greater accuracy the areas most
likely to have substantial numbers of homes
above the level that requires action. Free tests
are being offered to householders in those
areas. In 1996-97, almost 300,000 invitations
went out to householders to have free radon
measurements, and the NRPB published a
detailed map showing areas likely to have high
radon levels.
In Northern Ireland, survey work
undertaken by the Environment and Heritage
Service resulted in the identification of a
radon-affected area in South Down/Armagh
in 1993. Since then all householders in the
area have been offered a free survey. To date
some 12,000 houses have been monitored, and
since 1994 building control regulations have
required the inclusion of radon prevention
measures in new dwellings.
Radioactive Waste Disposal
The disposal of radioactive waste is regulated
under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (as
amended by the Environment Act 1995).
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and
level of activity, and the methods of disposal
reflect this. Most solid low-level waste
(LEW), material of low radioactivity, is
disposed of at the shallow disposal facility at
Drigg in Cumbria. Some small quantities of
LEW are disposed of at authorised landfdl
sites.
Intermediate-level waste (ILW) is currently
stored. UK Nirex Ltd was recently charged
with developing a disposal route for ILW. As
part of its site investigation programme for a
repository, Nirex proposed to construct a
Rock Characterisation Facility (RCF) near the
British Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield, in
Cumbria (see p. 271). Cumbria County
Council refused planning permission for the
RCF, and Nirex’s appeal against the refusal
was dismissed by the Secretary of State for the
Environment in March 1997. The
358
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Government is now considering the
implications of that decision for radioactive
waste management policy. Nirex has no plans
to begin investigations at any sites.
The Government is developing a research
strategy for the disposal of high-level or heat¬
generating waste. This waste will first be
converted into a glasslike form and then stored
for at least 50 years to allow the heat and
radioactivity to decay.
Genetically Modified Organisms
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have
many potentially beneficial uses, such as better
and larger supplies of food and advances in
health care. As with any new technology, it is
important to make sure that there are no
significant risks to mankind or the
environment. This is done through the
Environmental Protection Act 1990 and
subsequent regulations. Advice on all
applications to release or market GMOs is
provided by a statutory advisory committee.
Britain participated in drawing up draft
international guidelines on safety in
biotechnology, which were adopted by the
United Nations Environment Programme in
1995. It also supports the development of a
safety protocol to the Convention on
Biological Diversity, which would focus on
transboundary movements of living modified
organisms.
Conservation
Britain has a long tradition of conservation,
and for many years has had policies and laws
designed to protect both its natural
environment and its built heritage. A wide
variety of designations are used to protect
areas, sites and monuments that are of special
interest, and various organisations work
towards the conservation of different aspects
of Britain’s national heritage.2
The Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions is responsible for

protection in England; the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport has responsibility
for the listing of buildings and for the
protection, through scheduling, of ancient
monuments in England. The Welsh Office,
The Scottish Office and the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland have
broadly equivalent responsibilities. These
departments delegate many of their
conservation responsibilities to the agencies
described below. In addition, local authorities
and a wide range of voluntary organisations
are actively involved in environmental
conservation and protection.
The Countryside and Nature
Conservation
Five government agencies are responsible for
countryside policy and nature conservation in
Britain:
• the Countryside Commission and
English Nature, which both operate in
England, the former being responsible
for countryside policy and the latter for
nature conservation;
• the Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW);
• Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH); and
• the Environment and Heritage Service in
Northern Ireland.
English Nature, the CCW and SNH fulfil
their responsibilities for international nature
conservation matters and those affecting Great
Britain as a whole through the Joint Nature
Conservation Committee (JNCC). The JNCC .
also undertakes research in connection with
these responsibilities and sets standards
for data, monitoring and other matters
concerning nature conservation. It includes
representatives from Northern Ireland and
independent members, and has a supporting
specialist staff. Its budget for 1997-98 is £4.5
million.
Countryside Agencies
The Countryside Commission, the CCW,
SNH and the Environment and Heritage
Service are responsible for promoting the
359
THE ENVIRONMENT
enhancement of the natural beauty and
amenity of the countryside and encouraging
the provision of facilities for open-air
recreation—while respecting the needs of
those who live and work in the countryside.
Activities undertaken by these bodies include:
• advising the Government on countryside
matters;
• assisting the provision by local authorities
arid others of facilities for recreation in
the countryside, often within easy reach
of towns;
• designating and improving recreational
rights of way;
• undertaking research projects; and
• ensuring the protection of special
landscapes.
Total funding for the countryside agencies
in 1997-98 is £24 million for the Countryside
Commission, £23 million for the CCW, £37
million for SNH and £21.5 million for the
Environment and Heritage Service.
The Countryside Commission recognises
over 210 country parks and over 250 picnic
sites in England. A further 36 country parks in
Wales are recognised by the CCW. In
Scotland there are also 36 country parks, and
many local authority and private sector
schemes for a variety of countryside facilities
have been approved for grant aid by SNH.
Nature Conservation Agencies
English Nature, the CCW and SNH are the
Government’s statutory advisers on nature
conservation in their areas. Their work
includes:
• establishing and managing National
Nature Reserves and encouraging the
establishment of Local Nature Reserves;
• advising the Government;
• identifying and monitoring Sites of
Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs—see
below);
• providing general nature conservation
information and advice;
• giving grants; and
• supporting and conducting research.
English Nature’s funding for 1997-98 is
nearly £39 million.
In March 1997 there were 343 National
Nature Reserves in Britain covering more than
200,000 hectares (over 490,000 acres), and
three statutory Marine Nature Reserves.
Nearly 6,200 SSSIs had been notified in Great
Britain for their plant, animal, geological or
physiographical features. Some are of
international importance and have been
designated for protection under the EC Birds
Directive or the Ramsar Convention (see p.
366). Local authorities have declared over 500
Local Nature Reserves in England, 23 in
Scotland and 38 in Wales.
In England, the Countryside Commission
and English Nature have jointly mapped and
described areas of distinct landscape and
ecological character, covering the whole
country (English Nature’s ‘Natural Areas’ and
the Commission’s Countryside Character
Programme). Their Character Map of England
was launched in December 1996. This
framework will underpin the separate
programmes of the two agencies and guide
countryside policies. The Northern Ireland
Countryside Survey, published in June 1997,
records resources such as woodland, semi¬
natural vegetation, field boundaries and
agricultural land in selected areas across the
Province.
English Nature enters into land
management agreements with owners and
occupiers of SSSI land, increasingly to
support management that benefits its wildlife
and natural features. Overall, English Nature’s
grant schemes provide more than £2.2 million
a year to assist local action to sustain
biodiversity and geodiversity. SNH and the
CCW also enter into land management
agreements.
Nature conservation in Northern Ireland is
the responsibility of the Environment and
Heritage Service of DOENI. The NI Council
for Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the DOENI on nature conservation
matters, including the establishment and
management of land and marine nature
reserves and the declaration of Areas of
Special Scientific Interest. In all, 129 Areas of
Special Scientific Interest had been declared
by August 1997, covering 79,260 hectares
360
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
(196,000 acres), and 45 statutory nature
reserves had been established.
Wildlife Protection
The principal legislation protecting wildlife in
Great Britain is the Wildlife and Countryside
Act 1981. This:
• extended the list of protected species;
• restricted the introduction into the
countryside of animals not normally
found in the wild in Britain (in July 1997
the Government proposed to make it
illegal to keep non-native fish in, or
release them into, any waters in England
and Wales without a licence—again, to
protect native species); and
• afforded greater protection for SSSIs
than previously and made provision for
Marine Nature Reserves.
There is also provision for reviews of the
list of protected species to be conducted by the
three official nature conservation agencies,
acting jointly through the JNCC, every five
years, and for recommended changes to be
submitted to the Secretary of State for the
Environment, Transport and the Regions (see
p. 2). In Northern Ireland separate legislation
on species and habitat protection is in line
with the rest of Britain.
The Partnership for Action Against
Wildlife Crime (PAW) was launched in
1995. In March 1997 PAW made
recommendations for action to strengthen
the powers of the police and the
enforcement of legislation against wildlife
crime. It proposed that courts be given the
option of imprisoning criminals who steal
or kill endangered species, and that greater
use should be made of DNA testing in
combating crime of this kind. In May
1997, two egg collectors were fined a
record £90,000 each for illegally targeting
protected birds on a nature reserve on the
Scottish island of Orkney.
County wildlife trusts, urban wildlife trusts
and the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds (RSPB) play an important part in
protecting wildlife throughout Britain, and
between them have established over 2,000
reserves. The county and urban trusts are
affiliated to a parent organisation, ‘RSNC The
Wildlife Trusts’. The RSPB is the largest
voluntary wildlife conservation body in
Europe.
Species Recovery and Reintroduction
Extensive research and management are
carried out to encourage the recovery of
populations of species threatened with
extinction. The three nature conservation
agencies have also set up recovery
programmes for a number of threatened
species of plants and animals. During
1996-97, English Nature’s programme
covered 49 species, including the bittern,
dormouse, lady’s-slipper orchid, sand lizard
and fen raft spider. The aim is to ensure the
survival of self-sustaining populations of these
threatened species in the wild. SNH has a
programme initially covering 17 species, and
the CCW one covering 15 species.
Projects have also been established to
reintroduce species into areas in which they
used to be found. For example, the red kite
had died out in England and Scotland,
although it was still found in Wales and
mainland Europe. An international project is
now being co-ordinated by English Nature,
SNH and the RSPB to bring nestling red kites
from Sweden, Spain and Germany and release
them into the wild in areas which the species
had previously inhabited. By 1997, breeding
populations had been established in southern
England and Northern Scotland. Sand lizards
were recently reintroduced to sand dunes on
the Welsh west coast, having not been
recorded in Wales since the 1950s; and in
1995-96, the natterjack toad was reintroduced
to Talacre Warren in Clwyd, where there had
previously been strong colonies.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (see p.
342) holds seeds from about 3,000 plant
species which are extinct or under severe
threat in the wild, and has been successful
with reintroduction projects. Its new
Millennium Seed Bank is looking to hold
seeds of all seed-bearing plants in Britain by
the year 2000, and 10 per cent of flowering

(see p. 342) also plays a significant role.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree Preservation Orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands.
Once a tree is protected, it is in general an
offence to cut down or reshape it without
permission. Courts can impose substantial
fines for breaches of such orders. Where
protected trees are felled in contravention of
an order or are removed because they are
dying, dead or dangerous, replacement trees
must be planted. Local authorities have
powers to enforce this.
Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes. The planting of
broadleaved trees has greatly increased since
the 1980s (see graph above). Major
afforestation projects involving the DETR and
the Countryside Commission include the
creation of 12 community forests near major
cities. The Woodland Trust is a voluntary
body which protects existing woodland and
plants new trees for the future. It now owns
839 woods across Britain, and has planted well
over a million trees in the past ten years or so.
In Scotland, the Central Scotland Woodland
Trust is promoting a major tree-planting and
environmental improvement scheme.
In 1997 about 85,000 broadleaved and
deciduous trees were planted in a
new community woodland at
Oughtrington near Warrington, in the
north west of England. The land for the
tree-planting was bought by the Woodland
Trust with the help of a £91,000 grant
from the Countryside Commission. Local
people raised £20,000 towards the venture.
The new woodland will add to the three
million trees already planted in the Mersey
Community Forest.
362
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Hedgerows
Hedgerows are more than just field
boundaries. They are wildlife corridors
sheltering a wealth of plant, insect and animal
life. For example, three-quarters of Britain’s
native lowland mammals and birds, and half
its butterfly species, breed in hedges. The
survival of hedgerows is essential to the
promotion of biodiversity.
In recent years, the scale of hedgerow
removal has provoked wide concern. Between
1984 and 1993, for example, 67,800 km
(42,375 miles) were ‘grubbed out’ from the
countryside of England and Wales. Although
the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 were
introduced in June, to control the removal of
important hedgerows, the new Government
believes more should be done to conserve and
expand this valuable element of our natural
heritage. It has therefore formed a group,
including representatives from statutory
agencies, local authorities and the main
farming and conservation bodies, to review
how the Regulations might be strengthened to
provide greater protection for hedgerows.
The Coast
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The protection of the coastline
against erosion and flooding is administered
centrally by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office and The
Scottish Office. Operational responsibility lies
with local authorities and the EA (see p. 348).
The Coastal Forum, administered by the
DETR, promotes discussion among key
bodies in England with interests in the coast.
A similar forum exists in Wales, and the
Scottish Coastal Forum provides a national
focus, advice and guidance on coastal issues in
Scotland. In 1996, the Government published
Coastal Zone Management: Towards Best
Practice, which looks towards identifying the
best ways of securing more integrated and
sustainable management of the coast.
Certain stretches of undeveloped coast of .
particular beauty in England and Wales are
defined as Heritage Coast. Jointly with local
authorities, the countryside agencies have
designated 45 Heritage Coasts, protecting
1,530 km (956 miles), about 35 per cent of the
total length of coastline.
English Nature provides funds for groups
setting up voluntary marine nature reserves
and producing or implementing management
plans for England’s estuaries. So far, 13
reserves have been grant-aided and 29 estuary
management plans produced, covering more
than 85 per cent of England’s total estuarine
area. There are also 29 informal marine
consultation areas in Scotland. Statutory
bodies taking decisions that affect these areas
are asked to consult SNH. In addition, SNH
has established the Focus on Firths initiative
to co-ordinate management of the main
Scottish estuaries.
The National Trust, through its Enterprise
Neptune campaign, raises funds to acquire
and protect stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value. About
£24 million has been raised since 1965 and the
Trust now protects 904 km (565 miles) of
coastline in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The National Trust for Scotland also
owns large parts of the Scottish coastline and
protects others through conservation
agreements.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas
The Countryside Commission and the CCW
can designate National Parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), subject
to confirmation by the Secretaries of State for
the Environment, Transport and the Regions
and for Wales respectively.
Ten National Parks have been established
in England and Wales. Their aims are to
conserve and enhance the natural beauty,
wildlife and cultural heritage they contain,
and to promote opportunities for the
understanding and enjoyment by the public of
the areas they cover. They are ‘national’ in the
sense that they are of special value to the
nation as a whole. However, most of the land
remains in private hands. The Parks are each
administered by an independent National Park
Authority which, among other things:

• negotiates land management agreements
and encourages farmers to manage their
land in the traditional way;
• looks after footpaths and negotiates
agreements for public access;
• sets up information centres; and
• employs rangers.
The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads are also
administered by their own independent
authority and enjoy protection equivalent to
that of a National Park. Since 1994 the
planning policies that apply to the National
Parks have also applied to the New Forest area
in Hampshire.
A total of 41 AONBs have been designated,
covering around 20,400 sq km (7,900 sq miles)
in England and 830 sq km (320 sq miles) in
Wales. They comprise parts of the countryside
which lack extensive areas of open country
suitable for recreation and hence National
Park status, but which nevertheless have an
important landscape quality. Local authorities
are encouraged to give special attention to
AONBs in their planning and countryside
conservation work.
In Scotland, there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas, covering more
than 11,000 sq km (4,300 sq miles), where
certain kinds of development are subject to
consultation with SNH and, in the event of a
disagreement, with the Secretary of State for
Scotland. In addition, the Cairngorms and
Loch Lomond and the Trossachs are two
areas of outstanding natural importance in
Scotland. For the former, the Government has
established a Cairngorms Partnership; in the
latter case, the local authorities are considering
establishing a joint committee to manage the
area.
In Northern Ireland the Council for Nature
Conservation and the Countryside advises the
Government on the preservation of amenities
and the designation of areas of outstanding
natural beauty. In all, nine such areas have
been designated, covering over 2,800 sq km
(1,100 sq miles).
There are 17 forest parks in Great Britain,
covering nearly 3,000 sq km (1,150 sq miles)
which are administered by the Forestry
Commission. There are nine in Northern
Ireland, where they are administered by the
Forest Service of the Department of
Agriculture.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
Unitary, county and district councils in
England and Wales (see p. 80) are responsible
for keeping public rights of way signposted and
free from obstruction. Public paths are usually
maintained by these ‘highway authorities’,
which also supervise landowners’ duties to
repair stiles and gates. In Scotland, planning
authorities are responsible for asserting and
protecting rights of way. Subject to public
consultation, local authorities in Great Britain
can undertake legal procedures to create paths,
364
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
close paths no longer needed for public use,
and divert paths to meet the needs of either the
public or landowners. Farmers in England and
Wales are required by law to restore any public
paths damaged or erased by agricultural
operations. England has about 169,000 km
(106,000 miles) of rights of way and Wales has
about 40,000 km (24,000 miles).
The Countryside Commission is helping
authorities with the enormous task of bringing
all rights of way in England into good order,
and the Parish Path Partnership scheme,
introduced in 1992, is designed to stimulate
local involvement and improvement.
Meanwhile, the CCW is recording public
rights of way on a Geographical Information
System (GIS) computer database. Information
about path conditions is being collected for
communities throughout Wales through the
Community Path Survey. In Scotland a major
new ‘Paths for AH’ initiative has been started
by SNH to promote better access to
countryside close to towns and cities.
There are ten approved national trails open
in England, stretching about 2,800 km (1,740
miles), two in Wales, and three approved-
long-distance routes in Scotland, covering
about 550 km (345 miles). A new national trail
following the route of Hadrian’s Wall will be
ready in 2001, and proposals for the Cotswold
Way national trail have been submitted by the
Countryside Commission. A new Pennine
Bridleway, designed for horseriders and
mountain bikers, was approved in 1995. In
Wales, Glyndwr’s Way (a roughly circular
route in Powys), and in Scotland a new Great
Glen Way, are at an advanced stage of
planning.
Horse-riding and cycling in the countryside
are encouraged, for both health and
environmental reasons. Dozens of volunteers
are currently trying to identify ‘lost’ bridleways
in an effort to claim them back for riders as
legally defined rights of way. Meanwhile, the
National Cycle Network, a nationwide
construction project for the Millennium, is
being co-ordinated by the charity Sustrans
with the help of Lottery funds (see p. 47). One
of the aims of the Network, which should have
6,500 miles (10,400 km) of cycleway when
completed, is to popularise cycling as a viable
alternative to the car.
The 1996 UK Day Visits Survey
showed that:
• two-thirds of the population visited
the countryside during the course of
the year;
• of the 1,200 million day visits in 1996,
55 per cent were by car, a 5 per cent
decrease on the 1994 figure;
• walking was the single most popular
activity, with half the walks involving
a distance of over two miles; and
• each visitor spent on average £5 per
visit.
There is no automatic right of public access
to open country, although many landowners
allow it more or less freely. Local planning
authorities in England and Wales can secure
access by means of agreements with
landowners. If agreements cannot be reached,
authorities may acquire land or make orders
for public access. Similar powers cover
Scotland and Northern Ireland; in Northern
Ireland, the primary responsibility lies with
district councils. In Scotland, there is a
tradition of freedom to roam, based on
tolerance between landowners and those
seeking reasonable recreational access to the
hills.
Common land totals an estimated 550,000
hectares (1.4 million acres) in England and
Wales, but a legal right of public access exists
for only one-fifth of this area. Common land is
usually privately owned, but people other than
the owner may have rights over it, for
example, as pasture land. There is also a
widespread tradition of public enjoyment of
such land. Commons are protected by law and
cannot be built on or enclosed without
government consent in England and Wales.
There is no common land in Scotland or
Northern Ireland.
The Countryside Commission is hoping to
establish at least 250 new ‘millennium greens’
for local communities in England by the year
2000. By August 1997, 94 communities had
progressed to the second step towards creating
their own millennium green.
365
THE ENVIRONMENT
Voluntary Sector
Many voluntary organisations work to
preserve the amenities of the countryside,
including the National Trust, the Council for
the Protection of Rural England, the
Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales,
the Association for the Protection of Rural
Scotland and the Ulster Society for the
Preservation of the Countryside.
The Government assists both these and
other voluntary bodies covering the whole
spectrum of environmental activity, including
the preservation and appreciation of buildings
(see p. 368). For example, the Department of
the Environment, Transport and the Regions
makes grants through the Environmental
Action Fund, and The Scottish Office
Environment Department makes funds
available to organisations to help them carry
out conservation, improvement and education
work.
International Action
Britain’s international obligations to conserve
wildlife incHde the Berne Convention on the
conservation of European wildlife and natural
habitats, the Bonn Convention on the
conservation of migratory species, and EC
directives on the conservation of wild birds
and of natural habitats and wild fauna and
flora. The implementation of the habitats
directive, which was adopted into British
regulations in 1994, includes the designation
of protected sites called Special Areas of
Conservation (SACs). Together with Special
Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under the
EC wild birds directive, SACs will form an
EU-wide network of protected sites known as
Natura 2000. To date over 100 sites have been
identified as possible SACs, and some 74 sites
have been classified as SPAs. Britain is also
party to the Ramsar Convention on wetlands
of international importance, and has over 100
Ramsar sites.
Britain is a party to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which
strictly regulates trade in endangered species
by means of a permit system. In May 1997,
the new European Wildlife Trade Regulation
was launched, which will ban or control the
trade in more than 25,000 species of animals,
birds and plants.
The Convention on Biological Diversity
was signed by over 150 countries, including
Britain, at the 1992 Rio ‘earth summit’. It
required countries to develop national
strategies for the conservation and sustainable
use of biological diversity. Britain published
its biodiversity action plan in 1994; it
provides a strategy for conserving and
enhancing biodiversity over the next ten and
twenty years.
Follow-up action is now being carried
forward by Country Groups in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and a
Local Issues Group is providing guidance for
the development of Local Biodiversity Action
Plans. In Scotland, further guidance based on
the practical experience of four pilot local
authority areas will be issued in the autumn of
1997. The first progress report on the Action
Plans is due in 2000.
The Darwin Initiative forms part of the
measures announced by Britain at the first
‘earth summit’. It is intended to make British
experience, and financial support, available to
developing countries with important
biological resources, with the aim of assisting
the conservation and sustainable use of
species there. A committee of experts advises
the Government on the Initiative. Nearly 150
projects have been funded so far, including a
study of tall grassland habitats in Nepal; the
conservation of coral reef fish in Kenya and
Egypt; an inventory of the Mbaracayu Forest
Nature Reserve in Paraguay; and plant
biodiversity conservation training in Eastern
Europe.
A new species of bat has been found
breeding in Northern Ireland. Nathusius’s
Pipistrelle, which had previously been only
an occasional visitor to the British Isles,
was discovered by researchers working
with Queen’s University, Belfast. In May
1997, they found a nursery roost of these
rare bats, with a full complement of
females and juveniles, in buildings near
Antrim.
366
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Juildings and Monuments
Jsts of buildings of special historic or
rchitectural interest are compiled by the
jovernment, in England with the advice of
English Heritage. In Scotland and Wales,
)uildings are listed by Historic Scotland and
]ladw: Welsh Historic Monuments, executive
igencies of The Scottish and Welsh Offices
espectively. It is against the law to demolish,
:xtend or alter the character of any ‘listed’
luilding without prior consent from the local
ilanning authority or the appropriate
Secretary of State (or from Historic Scotland
n Scotland). The local planning authority can
ssue ‘building preservation notices’ to protect
or six months unlisted buildings that are at
isk, while the Government considers whether
hey should be listed. In Northern Ireland,
OOENI, advised by the Environment and
heritage Service and the Historic Buildings
Council, is responsible for the listing of
buildings.
In England, details of each listed building
ire contained in about 2,000 volumes (now
ivailable on a computerised database as well)
vhich can be inspected at the offices of the
Jloyal Commission on the Historical
Vlonuments of England in Swindon and
London. The lists for specific local authorities
ire also held by the local council planning
mthorities, where they are available for
:onsultation, and at some public libraries.
Ancient monuments are similarly protected
:hrough a system of‘scheduling’. English
Heritage, the government agency responsible
for the conservation of historic remains in
England, is currently engaged in a systematic
issessment of all archaeological sites in
England, in order to identify which of them
(out of some 600,000) should be afforded
statutory protection. Similar efforts are being
made to increase the number of listed
buildings and ancient and historic scheduled
monuments in Wales and in Northern Ireland,
where a resurvey of historic buildings began in
1997.
Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport, and Historic
Scotland. Historic Royal Palaces and the
Royal Parks Agency are the executive agencies
which carry out this function outside
Scotland.
English Heritage cares for 408 properties
on the Government’s behalf, advises the
Government on certain categories of
application for consent to alter or demolish
scheduled monuments and listed buildings,
and gives grants for the repair of ancient
monuments and historic buildings in England.
Most of its monuments are open to the public.
There were a record 11.3 million visitors to
English Heritage properties in 1997, and the
number of paying members rose by 13 per
cent, Core government funding for English
Heritage is £105 million in 1997-98.
In Scotland and Wales, Historic Scotland,
which cares for 330 monuments, and Cadw,
with 131, perform similar functions. An
Ancient Monuments Board and an Historic
Buildings Council advise the Secretaries of
State. In Northern Ireland, DOENI has 182
historic monuments in its care, managed by
the Environment and Heritage Service.
DOENI is also advised by a Historic Buildings
Council and a Historic Monuments Council.
Local planning authorities have designated
more than 8,600 ‘conservation areas’ of special

architectural or historic interest in England;
there are 478 in Wales, 601 in Scotland and 54
in Northern Ireland, designated by DOENI.
These areas receive additional protection
through the planning system, particularly over
the proposed demolition of unlisted buildings.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
works of art and other items of outstanding
interest which are of importance to the national
heritage. Government funding for 1997-98 is
£5 million. The Fund is also used for
distributing the heritage share of the proceeds
from the National Lottery (see p. 47). By
August 1997, £686 million had been awarded
to projects from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Among the voluntary organisations which
campaign for the preservation and
appreciation of buildings are:
• the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings;
• the Ancient Monuments Society;
• the Georgian Group;
• the Victorian Society;
• the Twentieth Century Society;
• the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland;
• the Ulster Architectural Heritage
Society;
• the Architectural Heritage Fund; and
• the Council for British Archaeology.
Although they are funded largely by
subscription and private donations, some of
these societies have statutory responsibilities,
in recognition of which they receive
government support.
The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), a charity with 2.4
million members, owns and protects well over
300 properties open to the public, in addition
to 272,600 hectares (673,300 acres) of land in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Scotland has its own National Trust, which
owns 40 historic buildings, including a
number of castles, and 74,800 hectares
(184,700 acres) of land.
The Civic Trust makes awards for
development and restoration work which
enhance surroundings. It undertakes urban
regeneration projects and acts as an umbrella
organisation for nearly 1,000 civic societies.
There are associate trusts in Scotland, Wales
and north-east England. In Northern Ireland,
there are currently 11 building preservation
trusts.
Industrial, Transport and Maritime Heritage
Britain was the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, and many
advances in manufacturing originated in
Britain. The resulting rich industrial heritage
includes such sites as the Ironbridge Gorge,
where Abraham Darby (1677-1717) first
smelted iron using coke instead of charcoal.
This has now been designated a World
Heritage Site (see below). Many other
museums devoted to the preservation of
industrial buildings and equipment have been
set up, such as the Newcastle Discovery
Museum and the Carrickfergus Gasworks
Museum.
Britain also pioneered railways, and has a
fine heritage of railway buildings and
structures. A large number of disused railway
lines have been bought by railway preservation
societies, and several railway museums have
been established, for example, the Steamtown
Railway Museum in Carnforth, Lancashire.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
recently awarded £25 million to secure the
structure, operation and environment of an
87-mile section of the Kennet and Avon
Canal, an important part of Britain’s inland
waterway heritage (see p. 314).
Reminders of Britain’s maritime past are
also preserved. Portsmouth is home to HMS
Victory (Admiral Nelson’s flagship), HMS
Warrior (the world’s first iron battleship), and
the remains of the Mary Rose, the world’s only
surviving 16th-century warship, raised from
the seabed in 1982. The Imperial War
Museum has opened the cruiser HMS Belfast
to the public on the river Thames in London.
Isambard Kingdom Brunei’s SS Great Britain,
the world’s first large screw-driven ship, is
preserved in Bristol. A voluntary body, the
Maritime Trust, has been established to
preserve vessels and other maritime items of
historic or technical interest. The Trust’s
368
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
vessels include the clipper Cutty Sark at
Greenwich, in London. In all, it is estimated
that some 400 historic ships are preserved in
Britain, mostly in private hands.
World Heritage Sites
So far, Britain has 14 sites in the World
Heritage List, which was established under
the World Heritage Convention to identify
and secure lasting protection for those parts of
the world heritage of outstanding universal
value. These sites are:
• Canterbury Cathedral, with St
Augustine’s Abbey and St Martin’s
Church, in Kent;
• Durham Cathedral and Castle;
• Studley Royal Gardens and Fountains
Abbey, in North Yorkshire;
• Ironbridge Gorge, with the world’s first
iron bridge and other early industrial
sites, in Shropshire;
• the prehistoric stone circles at
Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
• Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire;
• the city of Bath, in north-east Somerset;
• Hadrian’s Wall, the former Roman
frontier in northern England;
• the Tower of London;
• the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster,
also in London;
• the islands of St Kilda, in Scotland;
• Edinburgh Old and New Towns;
• the castles and town walls of King
Edward I, in north Wales; and
• the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway
Coast, in Northern Ireland.
A fifteenth site has been proposed to
UNESCO: Maritime Greenwich in London,
including the old Royal Observatory, the
National Maritime Museum, the Royal Naval
College and the town centre. In addition, Britain
has two natural sites in its overseas Dependent
Territories (see p. 121): Gough Island (part of
Tristan da Cunha) in the South Atlantic; and
Henderson Island in the South Pacific.

Economic trends in recent decades have altered traditional patterns and
locations of employment. Inner-city areas have suffered from the closure of
long-established industries, leaving problems of dereliction and
unemployment. Unemployment also affects farming and other industries in
the countryside. Government policy seeks to address these problems, as part of
a wider strategy for reducing inequalities in British society, using a range of
regeneration programmes to stimulate business, employment and physical
renewal in deprived urban and rural areas. Through the use of the statutory
system of land-use planning and development control it aims for sustainable
development, balancing demands for land from business, housing, transport,
farming and leisure, while protecting the environment.
A comprehensive review of regeneration policies throughout the country is in
progress. Legislation will establish a network of Regional Development
Agencies in England with considerable local autonomy to co-ordinate regional
economic and social development, which will be aided by an integrated
transport policy at national, regional and local levels. The main priorities for
planning are decentralisation, giving greater powers to the regions; creating a
more integrated approach to policy formulation; and improving efficiency in
the working of the planning system.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
The Government’s regeneration policies stand
alongside programmes for health, education,
social services and housing in its overall
strategy for reducing economic and social
inequalities. The Government Offices for the
Regions (GORs—see pp. 6 and 9) carry out
many local regeneration and development
functions, working in partnership with local
communities, including local government, to
maximise economic prosperity and quality of
life. The aim is to overcome the causes of local
and regional social and economic decline—
unemployment, bad housing, crime, poor
health and a degraded environment.
370
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
Policy is guided by five key principles:
integration, decentralisation, regeneration,
partnership and sustainability. The
Government plans to adopt a more coherent
and integrated approach to regional economic
development and planning, and to improve
regional accountability. Together with
devolution for Scotland and Wales (see pp.
21-9), the Government is to set up Regional
Development Agencies throughout England
and also a strategic authority for London. The
new Agencies will formulate local priorities, and
there will be greater local decision-making.
Some regeneration programmes will retain the
competitive element introduced by the last
Government. Existing partnerships between the
private and public sectors will be strengthened.
Sustainability will be a central focus, including a
strong commitment to a ‘green approach’.
The new Regional Development Agencies,
which are expected to be operational from
April 1999, will have several functions—
including promoting inward investment,
helping small businesses and co-ordinating
regional economic development and wider
regeneration. They will work closely with the
GORs (sharing for the most part the same
boundaries), local authorities and Training
and Enterprise Councils (see p. 175).
A major new strategy document for the
development of Northern Ireland up to
2025—Shaping Our Future—was released in
June 1997. Following extensive consultation, a
Regional Strategic Framework will be
published in 1998, taking into account the
need for a coherent and integrated approach
towards economic, social, environmental and
community development.
REGENERATION
A Single Regeneration Budget (SRB), brings
together 20 previous programmes. Several of
the more important ones are described below.
Urban issues in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland are being tackled by Programme for
Partnership, the Programme for the Valleys
and the Making Belfast Work initiative
respectively, as well as by various other
government programmes (see pp. 374-7).
Another set of programmes and policies are
directed at addressing the needs of rural areas.
The National Millennium Exhibition will
take place at Greenwich in London from
December 1999 on a 320-hectare (800-
acre) derelict site on the banks of the River
Thames, with funding from government,
the National Lottery (see p. 47) and
private sponsorship. Education and
technology for the future will be key
features of the exhibits. Current plans also
include the development, on adjacent land,
of 5,000 homes, a business district, and
industrial and retail areas. Seven of the
most deprived boroughs in Britain
surround the exhibition area. Between 10
and 12 million paying visitors are expected
to attend the Exhibition, which will last at
least 12 months. The Exhibition’s
centrepiece will be a 320m-wide, 50m-high
Millennium Dome, designed by the
Richard Rogers Partnership. Parks, lakes
and riverside walks will be a permanent
legacy. Projects and events celebrating the
new millennium will take place in many
other parts of Britain (see p. 47).
Single Regeneration Budget
The Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions has overall
responsibility for the SRB, which came into
operation in 1994 and has a budget of over
£1,300 million for 1997-98. The aim is to
promote flexible and locally responsive forms of
regeneration. The main programmes funded by
the SRB are administered by the GORs. The
SRB Challenge Fund supports bids for local
regeneration initiatives. The first two bidding
rounds were for schemes starting in 1995 and
1996; further schemes, commencing in 1997,
were given approval in the third round. A fourth
bidding round was launched in March 1997,
with supplementary guidance for the round
published in July. In total, some £1,700 million
will be available for new regeneration projects
during the three years to 1999-2000. These, it is
hoped, will create or safeguard 650,000 jobs,
support over 90,000 new businesses, complete or
improve 250,000 homes and support over 40,000
voluntary or community groups: On average,
every £1 of Challenge Fund money is estimated
to attract £2.50 of private investment.
371
THE ENVIRONMENT
The Urban Forum, a national body, brings
together voluntary organisations engaged in
urban policy and regeneration. Its aims are to
act as a communication channel between the
voluntary sector and the Government; develop
new ideas; and encourage local communities
and voluntary groups to engage in
regeneration partnerships.
City Challenge
Under the City Challenge initiative, local
authorities were invited, in partnership with
the private and voluntary sectors, local
communities and government agencies, to
submit plans for regenerating key urban
neighbourhoods by tackling problems of
physical decay, lack of economic opportunity
and poor quality of life. There have been two
rounds of the City Challenge competition,
with 31 successful partnerships each receiving
government funding of £37.5 million over five
years. In the six-year period to 1997—98, when
the initiative will end, £1,162 million of City
Challenge money is expected to attract over
£4,700 million of private sector investment.
In addition, it is forecast that these
partnerships will improve over 98,000
dwellings, create or preserve over 147,000
jobs, create or improve over 3.3 million sq
metres of business or commercial floor space
and assist over 8,000 new business start-ups.
Many principles of the City Challenge
initiative have been taken forward in the SRB
Challenge Fund programme.
Urban Development Corporations
Twelve urban development corporations
(UDCs) were set up in England to reverse
large-scale urban decline. The first two,
London Docklands and Merseyside, started
operations in 1981. Ten others were
subsequently established: Birmingham
Heartlands, Black Country (West Midlands),
Bristol, Leeds, Central Manchester,
Plymouth, Sheffield, Trafford Park (Greater
Manchester), Teesside, and Tyne and Wear.
At their peak, the UDCs covered about 16,000
hectares (about 40,000 acres). The Bristol,
Leeds and Central Manchester development
corporations have been closed down; all the
other UDCs are scheduled to be wound up by
March 1998. Public expenditure on the
programme will amount to £3,900 million
over the lifetime of the UDCs, including
spending on the Docklands Light Railway (see
p. 313).
English Partnerships
The key objectives of English Partnerships, a
government agency, are to create job
opportunities, attract inward investment and
improve the environment, through the
reclamation and development of vacant,
derelict and contaminated land throughout
England. It works with other public bodies
and the private and voluntary sectors. English
Partnerships has negotiated the transfer of 56
non-operational coal sites from British Coal,
and has announced a ten-year package of
regeneration plans with the potential to
generate more than 50,000 jobs in coalfield
areas. In 1996-97 a total of 468 new projects
were approved, which English Partnerships 1
estimate to be creating 24,200 jobs, reclaiming
1,100 hectares (2,700 acres) and attracting
£630 million in private finance. The budget
for 1997-98 is about £300 million. Assistance
is available from the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF—see p. 199).
Compacts
Over 100 school/industry Compacts have
been introduced in England during the past 15
years (see p. 447). They aim to motivate young
people to achieve more at school and to
continue in further education and training
after age 16. Over 224,000 young people,
1,600 schools and 21,000 employers
participated in Compacts in 1995-96.
Regional Enterprise Grants
The DTFs Regional Enterprise Grant
programme has been supporting investment
and innovation projects in small firms in
certain designated areas. A total of £14.8
million was allocated to small businesses in
1996-97.

LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
Other Measures
The first of a network of City Technology
Colleges was opened near Birmingham in
1988; 15 are currently operating. Intended to
raise educational standards, the colleges have
been established jointly by government and
industry. Training programmes (see chapter
12) are also helping many people in the inner
cities. In addition, over 100 Employment
Service ‘outreach’ staff are based in, or
regularly visit, inner-city areas, where they
help unemployed people look for jobs and
encourage them to participate in employment
and training programmes. This activity
supplements normal Jobcentre services.
The Government encourages tourism as a
force for improving inner-city areas, and a
number of major projects which create a
cultural and artistic focus for inner-city
regeneration have been undertaken. Examples
include the development of the Royal
Armouries Museum at Clarence Dock in
Leeds, which opened in 1996 at a cost of over
£40 million, and the International Convention
Centre in Birmingham. The English Tourist
Board and regional tourist boards encourage
promotional activities in inner-city areas
through local initiatives bringing together
tourist boards, local authorities, the private
sector and other agencies.
Groundwork Trusts
Groundwork Trusts seek to alleviate
environmental problems arising from
dereliction and vandalism and to increase
public awareness of opportunities to change
and improve local environments. They work
in partnership with public bodies, the private
sector, other voluntary organisations and
individuals. Over 100 local authorities are
involved, including eight in London and 23
metropolitan districts. The Groundwork
Foundation is a national body providing the
Trusts with advice and support.
Housing Action Trusts
The six Housing Action Trusts (HATs) are
non-departmental public bodies charged with
the task of regenerating severely rundown
housing estates in north Hull, Liverpool,
Birmingham (Castle Vale estate) and the
London boroughs of Waltham Forest, Tower
Hamlets and Brent (Stonebridge estate). The
HATs manage 16,700 existing properties, and
have ten-year programmes in which to
complete their work. HATs’ integrated
approach to regeneration includes
programmes to provide homes, education,
training, employment and recreational
facilities for their 38,000 residents. Since 1991
the HATs have provided 1,406 new and 3,545
renovated homes, found training places for
over 4,000 residents and created or preserved
3,200 jobs, 83 per cent of which have been
filled by estate residents.
European Union Programmes
Rundown areas in Britain benefit from EU
Structural Funds (see p. 126). These come
mainly from the ERDF, which finances
infrastructure projects and support for
industry, among other things. Objectives for
the Funds include regenerating areas affected
by industrial decline and combating long-term
unemployment. The Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR) is responsible for co-ordinating
ERDF programmes in England. About £1,000
million from the ERDF has been allocated to
declining industrial (Objective 2) regions in
England during the period 1997-99. England
has also been allocated £200 million and £130
million under Objectives 1 and 5b (see p. 199)
for the same period. Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland also receive ERDF (£400
million, £180 million and £290 million
respectively in 1997-98) under Objectives 1, 2
and 5b. The EU Special Support Programme
for Peace and Reconciliation is allotting
Northern Ireland projects a total of £56.7
million during 1997-98 (see p. 377).
Rural Development
The British countryside continues to undergo
considerable change. Employment in
traditional sectors such as agriculture, mining
and rurally based defence establishments is in
decline and small firms are increasingly
important to the rural economy. The need
373
THE ENVIRONMENT
remains for more diverse employment
opportunities; the tourism industry, for
example, provides work openings for many
areas. Rapid technological change is giving
new chances for industry to overcome
problems of remoteness arising from a rural
location, though availability of advanced
telecommunications infrastructure is still far
from universal. Faxes, modems, the Internet
and other IT equipment now make it much
easier for people to work at home. Some rural
areas have been successful in recent years in
attracting high-technology industries. Other
areas, however, have fragile economies which
require diversity to become robust.
Low wages remain a characteristic of many
rural areas and the decline of local services
causes major problems for many people. The
movement of people into the countryside from
the towns has increased the demand for
housing and, with a major projected growth in
the number of households, this is likely to
continue.
The Rural Development Commission is the
government agency concerned with the
economic well-being of the people who live
and work in rural England. During 1997-98 it
expects to spend some £45 million. The bulk
of this money is targeted at 31 Rural
Development Areas (RDAs), which cover 35
per cent of the land area of England and 2.75
million people. Expenditure within the RDAs
is used to diversify the rural economy and
strengthen rural communities through
projects developed in partnership with the
private, public and voluntary sectors. The
Commission also supports the voluntary
sector and key services countrywide.
Nationally, the Commission has an important
role in advising and influencing government
and other organisations.
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
Wales
The Welsh Capital Challenge (WCC),
introduced in April 1997, is designed to
support an integrated approach to capital
expenditure which promotes economic,
environmental and social development, and
which benefits disadvantaged urban and rural
areas in Wales. In 1997—98 the WCC awarded
£20 million for projects commencing in that
year and an additional £12 million for forward
commitments, generating over £27 million of
private sector investment. In the longer term
this assistance is expected to stimulate further
investment of nearly £80 million by the
private sector and create an additional 1,800
jobs.
The Strategic Development Scheme (SDS)
is designed to support local authority
strategies and projects for economic,
environmental and social development, and
gives particular backing to comprehensive
local regeneration plans based on local
partnerships involving the voluntary and
private sectors. Over a threfe-year period, from
1997-98, the SDS is in the process of
transferring to the control of local authorities,
until some £38 million is at their disposal.
The delegated funding for 1997-98 is £11.6
million. Ministers are due to announce
arrangements for the 1998—99 WCC and SDS
shortly after their review of all economic grant
schemes administered by the Welsh Office,
local authorities, development agencies, and
other bodies.
The Programme for the Valleys for
1993-98 built on previous programmes for the
south Wales valleys and introduced new
initiatives for social, economic and
environmental regeneration. Its objective was
to create jobs; improve training, education and
transport; enhance the quality of the
environment; widen the quality and choice of
housing; and improve the health of local
people. In 1997 the Government announced
proposals for creating job opportunities in the
Valleys through the development of industrial
villages—new small and medium-sized high-
technology companies supplying larger
factories near the M4 motorway in Wales.
As part of its economic and environmental
development activities, the Welsh
Development Agency (WDA; see p. 31),
together with local authorities and the private
sector, is working to regenerate and revitalise
towns and cities throughout Wales. Attracting
inward investment is a key priority. In urban
areas, through infrastructure and
environmental improvement schemes during
the last three years, it estimates that it has
374
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
brought in £268 million of private sector
investment. Urban Investment Grant
encourages private sector developments on
derelict and rundown sites in urban areas; the
1997-98 budget is £6.8 million. Other capital
development programmes have also played a
vital role in the expansion of the economy. For
example, the property development
programme provides readily available
industrial premises, both for local businesses
and inward investment projects.
Development is also encouraged by the
Land Authority for Wales, a statutory body
with powers to make land available for urban
progress, employment and social housing in
circumstances where the private sector would
find this difficult on its own. It is a self¬
financing land trading body which ploughs
back its profits for future investment.
The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation
was set up in 1987 to promote renewal in part
of south Cardiff, once the city’s commercial
centre. Government support for the
Corporation will be £53 million in 1997—98.
The Corporation’s regeneration strategy
includes a barrage project, which will create a
large freshwater lake within Cardiff Bay and
12 km (7 miles) of waterside frontage; a 400-
hectare (990-acre) bird reserve is to be
provided nearby to help compensate for the
loss of the Cardiff Bay habitat. Work on the
barrage is scheduled for completion in
December 1998; the bird reserve should be
ready before then. The regeneration targets
are for the creation of 29,000 new jobs in the
Cardiff Bay area, 5,900 new homes and over
£1,500 million of private investment.
The Development Board for Rural Wales
builds industrial and commercial premises,
provides a range of services to business and
promotes rural Wales abroad as a suitable
location for inward investment. In 1997-98 it
has a government budget of £20 million.
The 1997 White Paper A Voice for Wales,
which set out the Government’s plans for a
Welsh Assembly, contained proposals to
create a new ‘economic powerhouse’ agency
for Wales in advance of the establishment of
an Assembly. A transfer of the functions and
responsibilities of the Land Authority for
Wales and the Development Board for Rural
Wales to the WDA would form the nucleus of
the powerhouse. The intention is that the
expanded WDA should cover urban and rural
Wales; offer a range of services to business;
provide the land, sites and premises needed by
new and expanding businesses; and act as a
single point of contact for inward investors.
Scotland
Programme for Partnership, the current urban
regeneration policy framework, was
introduced in 1996. Under Programme for
Partnership, council-wide partnerships have
been formed in areas where there is significant
deprivation to develop broad regeneration
strategies. Each of these partnerships
comprises the local council, Scottish Homes
(see p. 385), the Local Enterprise Company
(see p. 175), other relevant agencies, and
representatives from the private sector, the
community and the voluntary sector. The
partnerships have in turn developed proposals
for Priority Partnership Areas (PPAs) and
Regeneration Programmes (RPs). A PPA is a
comprehensive regeneration initiative, lasting
up to ten years. An RP is a connected series of
regeneration proposals, backed by an overview
of an area’s needs, and lasts for up to five years.
Programme for Partnership builds on the
experience gained from four partnerships.1 Set
up in 1988, three of these are still operational,
led by the Scottish Office and involving
Scottish Enterprise (see p. 197), Scottish
Homes, local authorities, the private sector
and local communities. Their objectives
include plans to better the quality and tenure
mix of housing available to local people;
improve employment prospects by providing
more opportunities for training and further
education; and tackle social and environmental
problems on housing estates.
Progress has been made by each
Partnership in implementing its individual
strategy. That at Whitfield met its objectives
early, and the Scottish Office withdrew from
it in May 1995. However, the remaining
partners have pledged to carry forward and
sustain the regeneration process. The Scottish
Office will withdraw from the three remaining
1 Whitfield (Dundee), Castlemilk (Glasgow), Wester Hailes
(Edinburgh) and Fergustie Park (Paisley).
375
THE ENVIRONMENT
partnerships, after about ten years, during
1997-2000. As the progress made in these
areas must be protected, forward planning
groups have been set up to consider how this
can be done.
Local Enterprise Companies (LECs—see
p. 175), working under contract to Scottish
Enterprise, have substantial budgets and a
range of powers and functions to improve the
environment and encourage business and
employment in their areas. Responsibility for
derelict land reclamation also rests with
Scottish Enterprise, LECs and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise. They may acquire and
reclaim land either by agreement or
compulsorily; they seek to work more closely
with the private sector to bring land back into
use.
Many employers and business organisations
participate in Education Business Partnerships
in Scotland. The Training and Employment
Grants scheme is designed to increase access to
employment opportunities for young and long¬
term unemployed people.
A Partnership Fund, established in 1996,
supports rural partnerships of government
departments and agencies, private sector bodies
and voluntary groups with responsibilities in
rural areas. A National Rural Partnership has
been established to encourage the formation of
such local associations and to advise on
spending priorities for the Partnership Fund.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland (DOENI) leads an urban
regeneration drive through its Urban
Regeneration Group (URG). The URG has a
budget of about £52 million for 1997—98 and
aims to improve economic, social and
environmental conditions, its main focus of
activity being deprived and rundown areas. It
operates either with other government and public
sector bodies or through grants to the private
sector, including community and voluntary
groups. It also works with the International Fund
for Ireland (IFI) and implements parts of several
EU programmes; these sources provide
additional financial assistance.
The URG plans to spend £10.8 million in
1997-98 through Urban Development Grant,
Comprehensive Development Schemes and
Environmental Improvement Works. The first
is Northern Ireland’s principal urban
regeneration measure. Its objective is the
economic and physical renovation of inner-
city areas of Belfast and Londonderry, by
encouraging private enterprise and investment
in property development, leading to job
creation and improvement of the
environment. Since 1983, £66 million of
Urban Development Grant is estimated to
have generated £240 million of private sector
investment in Belfast, while in Londonderry
grant worth £27 million has brought in some
£71 million of private funding. Projected
Urban Development Grant expenditure for
the two cities in 1997—98 is £5.4 million.
The Community Economic Regeneration
Scheme (CERS), launched in 1989 to focus on
Belfast and Londonderry and larger towns,
and the Community Regeneration and
Improvement Special programme (CRISP),
launched in 1990, for small towns, are
designed to provide facilities such as
workshops and commercial outlets, and help
to boost local employment in areas where the
private sector is reluctant to invest. Both
schemes are funded by the DOENI with the IFI
(see p. 19). Some 16 CERS and 49 CRISP
schemes have been implemented with some £30
million of URG funds and about £41 million
from the IFI. Planned URG expenditure in
1997-98 is £3 million, which should be
matched or perhaps exceeded by the IFI.
In Belfast the Laganside Development
Corporation is charged with regenerating the
once derelict area around Belfast docks and
the city’s waterfront. Its annual DOENI grant
is about £7.6 million. The estimated
investment in Laganside since 1989 has been
about £100 million, in addition to the
Corporation’s own expenditure. Recent events
include the opening of the Waterfront Concert
Hall/Conference Centre, owned by Belfast
City Council. The Making Belfast Work
initiative (MBW) aims to strengthen and more
precisely target community, private and public!
sector efforts to tackle the problems of the
city’s most disadvantaged areas—by
increasing employability and improving the
quality of life. By March 1997 the MBW had
received some £200 million; planned spending
376
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
in 1997-98 is £20.7 million. Belfast also has a
Partnership Board, with public, private, trade
union and voluntary sector interests, to
promote a long-term vision of, and policies
for, urban renewal. The work of the DOENPs
Belfast Development Office and of the MBW
are to be merged into a Belfast Regeneration
Office.
The Londonderry Regeneration Initiative
(LRI) addresses dereliction, social deprivation
and economic difficulties. By March 1997
some £23 million had been allocated to the
LRI, with estimated spending in 1997-98 of
£2.7 million. Londonderry also has a
Partnership Board.
EU programmes implemented through the
URG include the Special Support Programme
for Peace and Reconciliation, whose sub-
programmes seek to promote urban
regeneration and to improve the social and
physical environment, develop derelict sites,
enhance areas where sectarian conflict has
been marked, and provide amenities
supported by local communities and new
employment opportunities in areas of greatest
need. Under sub-programme 6, a District
Partnership to harness the energies and talents
of local groups has been established in each
district council area of Northern Ireland. The
Physical and Social Environment sub-
programme 2 targets need at community level.
The Urban Community Initiative in Belfast
and Londonderry seeks solutions to socio¬
economic problems. Its Belfast sub-
programme especially targets Shankhill and
Upper Springfield; that for Londonderry
focuses on the Creggan estate, the Fountain
area and the Bogside/Brandywell districts.
Public Sector Land
The Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR) promotes
the sale and development of vacant and under¬
used public sector land in England.
Information is being assembled on potential
key sites and, where there are no firm plans to
market or develop them, action will be taken
to promote their sale. Under the ‘Public
Request to Order Disposal’ scheme, members
of the public are encouraged to ask the
Government to instruct public bodies to
dispose of vacant or under-used land on the
open market. In 1994 the rules governing the
way local authorities can spend the proceeds of
asset sales were altered to encourage the sale of
surplus land.
PLANNING
Direct responsibility for land-use planning in
Great Britain lies with local authorities. The
Secretaries of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions, Wales and
Scotland have overall responsibility for the
operation of the system. The DETR brings
together the major responsibilities for land-use
planning, housing and construction,
countryside policy and environmental
protection, and transport in England. The
Welsh and Scottish Offices have broadly
equivalent responsibilities. In Northern
Ireland, the DOENI, through the Planning
Service Agency, is in charge of planning
matters, liaising with the district councils.
In England, the DETR provides national
and regional guidance on planning, while
strategic planning is the responsibility of the
county councils and unitary district
authorities. In Scotland, the Scottish Office
issues National Planning Policy Guidelines
and Planning Advice Notes. At present in
England, most district councils are responsible
for local plans and development control. In
London and the metropolitan counties, and in
some non-metropolitan unitary areas, districts
prepare unitary development plans and are
responsible for development control. In Wales
and Scotland, planning responsibilities rest
with the new unitary authorities and council
areas (see p. 80).
Development Plans
Development plans have a central role in
shaping patterns of progress in an area, as
planning decisions must be made in
accordance with the development scheme
unless ‘material considerations’ indicate
otherwise. In England and Wales, the
preparation of a district-wide development
plan is mandatory. The Government is
considering further measures to speed up plan
adoption.
377
THE ENVIRONMENT
The present system in England comprises
structure, local and unitary development
plans. Structure plans set out broad policies
for the development and use of land, which
are adopted by county councils and some
unitary councils. In some cases planning
arrangements for local authorities require
structure planning to be carried out over an
area wider than that of an individual authority.
In these circumstances, unitary authorities are
given structure plan responsibility for their
own area so that they can work jointly with
neighbouring authorities to maintain a joint
scheme covering their combined areas. Local
plans are prepared in general conformity with
the adopted structure plan, and provide
detailed guidance for development; these are
adopted by most district councils and National
Park authorities. Unitary development plans,
setting out both strategic and detailed land-
use and development policies, are adopted by
metropolitan districts, London boroughs and
some non-metropolitan unitary authorities.
County and unitary councils also draw up
local plans for minerals and waste issues, for
which they are the development control
authority.
In Wales, the new unitary authorities have
taken over responsibility for plan preparation
and will be drawing up unitary development
plans for their areas. It is intended to have
these plans in place by the year 2000. In
Scotland, where unitary development plans
are not a feature of the system, the new
councils have also undertaken responsibility
for plan preparation; in some cases, structure
plans will be taken forward by a number of
councils working together. Under Northern
Ireland’s single-tier system, plans are prepared
by the DOENI.
Members of the public are encouraged to
participate in the formulation of plan policies
and proposals. They can formally object and,
in the case of local and unitary development
plans, make their case in public to an
independent inspector (reporter in Scotland).
When devising plans, the authorities must
take account of any national or regional
guidance issued by the Government; regional
guidance exists only in England.
An important element of the Government’s
strategy for sustainable development (see
chapter 21) is for full use to be made of urban
land in existing towns and cities, while having
regard to the quality of the urban
environment, in order to avoid the need to
develop ‘greenfield’ sites and to reduce
transport demands. In 1996 the previous
Government announced new planning
guidance aimed at revitalising town centres in
England. It encouraged a plan-led approach to
promoting development in town centres,
emphasised the importance of a coherent town
centre parking strategy in maintaining urban
vitality, and required a clearer assessment of
out-of-town retail proposals that could have
an impact on the viability of town centres.
When putting forward out-of-town retail
proposals, developers are expected to
demonstrate that they have first thoroughly
examined more central sites. While broadly
similar guidance for Scotland also came out in
1996, the then Government issued for
consultation in March 1997 draft revised
guidance directed at clarifying the policy to
secure more consistent interpretation of the
original principles. The finalised guidance
emphasises government commitment to town
centres.
Green Belts
Green Belts are areas of land meant to be left
open and free from inappropriate
development. The aims are to check the
sprawl of large built-up areas; safeguard
surrounding countryside from encroachment;
prevent neighbouring towns from merging;
preserve the special character of historic
towns; and assist in urban regeneration by
encouraging the re-use of derelict and other
urban land.
Green Belts have been established around
major cities and conurbations, including
London, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Merseyside, Greater Manchester and the
West Midlands, as well as several smaller
towns. Some 1.5 million hectares (3.8 million
acres) are designated as Green Belt in England
and 155,000 hectares (380,000 acres) in
Scotland. The Government attaches great
importance to the protection of Green Belts,
which have been a cornerstone of the planning
system for over 40 years. Planning guidance
378
LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
in Green Belts in England was revised in 1995
o strengthen the strict controls over
levelopment and to secure greater benefits for
he environment. Guidance on Green Belts in
,Vales was introduced in 1996.
development Control
Vlost development requires specific planning
jermission. Applications are dealt with in the
ight of development plans and other relevant
banning considerations, including national
md regional guidance. Currently, about
150,000 applications for planning permission
ire received by district councils in England
;ach year, of which some 88 per cent are
ipproved. The Government is keen to speed
jp the planning process, and local authorities
in Great Britain have been set the target of
deciding 80 per cent of applications within
sight weeks. In Scotland, planning authorities
have been set a target of determining at least
50 per cent of applications within two calendar
months. However, an increased target of 85
per cent has been set for minor business and
industry, and other minor development
applications. This target rises to 90 per cent
for householder applications within the same
two-month deadline.
Local planning authorities in England and
Wales have a duty to publicise planning
applications in their areas. Methods
commonly used include site notices,
newspaper advertising and notifying
neighbours. In Scotland applicants are
required to notify owners, occupiers and, in
some cases, lessees of neighbouring land and
buildings when an application is submitted to
the planning authority. Newspaper advertising
is required for certain types of development.
Applicants have a right of appeal to the
relevant Secretary of State if a local authority
refuses planning permission, grants it with
conditions attached, or fails to decide an
application within eight weeks2 (or whatever
longer period is agreed with the applicant).
The majority of appeals are decided on the
basis of written submissions. However, either
party has the right to be heard by an inspector
(reporter in Scotland) at a public local inquiry
or at a hearing. A local inquiry is usually held
for more complicated or controversial
applications. In Northern Ireland, neighbour
notification and newspaper advertising are
carried out by the DOENI Planning Service
Agency. Appeals are determined by the
Planning Appeals Commission, which is also
responsible for holding public local inquiries.
The Secretaries of State can decide that a
planning application should be referred to
them for decision. They generally only use
this power to ‘call in’ proposals which raise
planning issues of national or regional
importance. In such circumstances, applicants
and local planning authorities have the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the
Secretary of State, and a public inquiry will
normally be held. Examples of major
proposals considered at public inquiry include
a fifth terminal at London’s Heathrow Airport
and the proposed superquarry at Lingerabay
on Harris (Outer Hebrides). In Northern
Ireland, major planning applications can be
referred to a public inquiry in certain
circumstances.
The Scottish Office has launched a 1997
Quality Awards Scheme which will highlight
excellence in the planning service.
Environmental Impact Assessment
Planning applications for certain types of
development must be accompanied by an
environmental statement. This should
describe the likely adverse environmental
effects and measures to minimise them.
In the next 20 years some 4 million houses
and flats may have to be built in England
to accommodate people in need of decent
housing. The Government has stressed
that the countryside should not normally
be used for constructing houses for needy
urban dwellers; these people should be
housed in towns and cities in accordance
with overall plans for sustainable urban
development. Any additional new housing
in rural areas ought to be in keeping with
the traditional character of the countryside
and not be prejudicial to the environment.
2 Two calendar months in Scotland.
THE ENVIRONMENT
Statements are available to the public and
statutory bodies such as the Countryside
Commission and English Nature (see pp.
359-60). Planning authorities must consider
the environmental statement, and any
representations received on it, before granting
planning permission.
Architectural Standards and the Built
Environment
The Government emphasises the importance
of good design and architectural quality, both
in individual buildings and in the built
environment as a whole. The appearance of
new developments, and their relationship to
their surroundings, are issues that should be
addressed through the style of individual
buildings and through the urban pattern.
While local planning authorities are expected
to reject designs which are out of scale or
character with their surroundings, the
Government’s view is that they should not
seek to control the detailed composition of
buildings unless the sensitive character of
their location justifies it, nor should they seek
arbitrarily to impose a particular architectural
taste or look. Guidance on architectural
competitions has been updated by the DETR
and the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport. The Royal Fine Art Commissions for
England and Scotland advise government
departments, local planning authorities and
other public bodies on questions of quality,
public amenity and artistic importance.
The new Architects Registration Board,
together with the architects’ professional
bodies—the Royal Institute of British
Architects, the Royal Incorporation of
Architects in Scotland and the Royal Society
of Ulster Architects—exercises control over
standards in architectural training and
encourages high standards in the profession.
The Royal Town Planning Institute carries
out similar functions for the planning

In all, 181,100 new dwellings were constructed in Great Britain in 1996,
compared with 189,900 in 1995. Owner-occupation has increased from 50 per
cent in 1971 to 67 per cent at the end of 1996. The public, charitable and private
sectors all build housing for sale or rent, with about four-fifths of new
dwellings being constructed by the private sector for sale to owner-occupiers.
Local authorities, housing associations and the private sector provide low-cost
housing for rent or sale. Supporting home ownership and ensuring an adequate
provision of social and private rented housing are key government objectives.
The release of receipts from the sale of council houses will provide additional
resources for building and refurbishing homes to meet need. Further measures
to tackle homelessness are being taken.
Government Policies
The Secretary of State for the Environment,
Transport and the Regions in England and
the Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland are responsible for
formulating housing policy and supervising
the housing programme. The Government is
working towards stability in the housing
market. Building societies, banks and other
providers of mortgages are encouraged to
offer flexible mortgages for home owners, and
there will also be greater protection for
consumers against the sale of unfair mortgage
packages.
Measures are planned to prevent the
problem of‘gazumping’: this refers to a
situation in which the vendor of a property
breaks an agreement with a would-be
purchaser and accepts a higher purchase price
from someone else, the original would-be
purchaser having already incurred legal,
survey and other costs. Gazumping does not
occur in Scotland, which operates a system of
sealed bids for buying properties.
Rented Housing
The Government supports partnership
between the public sector, registered social
landlords (RSLs) and the private sector as
providers of good quality ‘social housing’—
housing provided at rents affordable to people
on low incomes, usually substantially below
market rents. Social rented housing is usually
owned either by local authorities or by RSLs,
and accounts for over a fifth of all homes. Set-
aside receipts from the sale of council housing
stock by local authorities are to be re-invested
381
THE ENVIRONMENT
gradually in building new houses and
rehabilitating existing properties.
Schemes to utilise private finance to improve
the public housing stock and provide greater
choice of housing will be encouraged; however,
such schemes will only go ahead with the
consent of the tenants concerned. Greater
protection will be given to tenants of private
rented houses in multiple occupation (HMOs).
The Government will publish an approved code
of practice setting out the amenity and fire safety
standards required in HMOs and bring into
effect a new duty on HMO landlords to keep
their properties fit for the number of occupants.
The Government also intends to introduce a
national mandatory licensing system for HMOs.
A new form of tenure, ‘commonhold’, will be
introduced in England and Wales, enabling
leaseholders of flats to own their homes
individually and the common parts of the
buildings containing their homes collectively.
Commonhold and other similar tenure systems
have been working successfully in Australia and
other countries for many years; they overcome
many of the problems associated with the
leasehold system. Additionally, the Government
intends to make it easier for leaseholders of flats
to buy their freehold.
Homelessness
Local authorities have a duty to secure
accommodation for families and vulnerable
individuals who are homeless through no fault of
their own. The problem of homeless people
living rough on the streets, often without any
family support, is being tackled in central
London and other areas through the Rough
Sleepers Initiative (see p. 388).
Home Ownership
The number of owner-occupied dwellings in
Great Britain amounted to 16 million at the end
of 1996, compared with 15.9 million in 1995.
Mortgage Loans
Most people buy their homes with a mortgage
loan, using the property as security. These are
obtained through building societies, banks or
Tenure in Great Britain, 1996
Housing

other financial institutions such as specialist
mortgage lenders. There are three main types of
mortgage—repayment (a straightforward loan),
endowment (a loan combined with life
insurance) and the new PEP mortgages (loans
combined with investment earnings).
Additionally, some companies grant loans for
house purchase to their employees. The amount
that lenders are prepared to advance to a would-
be house purchaser is generally calculated as a
multiple of his or her annual income, typically
up to two-and-a-half or three times earnings,
and the term of the loan is approximately 25
years. Owner-occupiers can claim tax relief on
interest payments on the first £30,000 of their
mortgages on their main home (see p. 163).
In the recession in the early 1990s, many
homeowners saw a fall in the value of their
homes, and some have had trouble keeping up
with mortgage payments. The Government is
encouraging the mortgage lending industry to
develop flexible mortgages which allow
borrowers to pay more than their normal
monthly payments and then make lower
payments, or else take a payment holiday, during
periods of financial pressure. This arrangement
can be particularly helpful to self-employed
people and others whose income tends to
fluctuate, and it can help prevent temporary gaps
in mortgage payments being treated as arrears.

Right to Buy and Low-Cost Ownership
With a few exceptions, in England and Wales
public tenants with secure tenancies of at least
two years’ standing are entitled to buy their
house or flat at a discount dependent upon the
length of the tenancy. Similar provisions apply
in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Nearly 2.2
million council, housing association and New
Town development corporation houses have
been sold into owner-occupation in Great
Britain. Sales are continuing at a rate of about
55,000 a year.
Other schemes which aim to increase low-
cost home ownership include shared
ownership schemes' and discounted sales of
empty properties owned by local authorities.
In addition, £60 million is being made
available to local authority tenants in England
in 1997-98 under the Cash Incentive Scheme,
under which tenants of social housing are
given cash help to buy in the private sector.
Over 5,000 local authority tenants a year are
receiving this assistance, thereby opening up
new lettings for those in greatest need.
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home
ownership scheme which allows purchasers to
buy a home for 70 per cent of its value, the
balance being secured as a charge on the
property. Scottish Homes operates a scheme
to encourage private developers to build for
owner-occupation in areas they would not
normally consider; in 1997-98 some £1.33
million will be devoted to the scheme. A
shared ownership scheme in Northern Ireland
is administered by the Northern Ireland Co-
ownership Housing Association.
Rented Sector
Local authorities work with RSLs and the
private sector to increase the supply of low-
cost housing without necessarily providing it
1 These involve the homeowner buying a share of a property from a
registered social landlord (RSI.) and paying rent for the
remainder.

themselves. RSLs are the main supplier of
new social housing. Rents on new private
sector lettings in Great Britain were
deregulated (freed from controls) in 1988,
with the aim of stimulating the private rented
sector, which had been declining for most of
this century.
Privately Rented Housing
Around 10 per cent of households rent from a
private landlord, and the Government wants
to see a healthy private rented sector. Assured
and assured-shorthold tenancies enable
landlords to charge a reasonable market rent
and recover possession of their property when
they need to. Assured and short assured
tenancies in Scotland are broadly similar. The
Housing Act 1996 has introduced measures to
encourage small landlords in England and
Wales to let property, by reducing paperwork
for letting on an assured shorthold tenancy

and by speeding up action on rent arrears. A
‘Rent a Room’ scheme enables homeowners to
let rooms to lodgers without having to pay tax
on rents up to a level of about £80 a week.
Housing investment trusts, set up to own
residential property for rent, benefit from tax
provisions designed to encourage institutional
investment in the private rented sector.
In Northern Ireland the private rented
sector accounts for approximately 4 per cent
of total housing stock; only a third of this is
subject to statutory control on rents. Rent
levels of controlled properties are linked to
those of the Northern Ireland Housing
Executive. Shorthold tenancies and assured
tenancies are available.
Social Housing
Social rented housing is usually owned either
by local authorities or by RSLs. It accounts
for over a fifth of all homes.

English Nature has a project
with the Zoo Federation and
Forest Enterprise to save and
re-establish it. Removal of
rhododendron plants has already
allowed it to expand its
single colony, and a small number
of spiders have been imported
from Denmark to gain experience
of rearing them in captivity.
If successful, captive rearing of
native spiders should start soon
with a probable first release date
into the wild in about 2003.
Eurotunnel has taken a leading role

Folkestone in Kent, is designated
as one of special scientific interest
(SSSI). Sensitive land management
has allowed plants and insects to
flourish on the previously poorly
maintained site, and Eurotunnel’s
financial contribution has been
recognised by a 1997 SSSI Award

The North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty
is characterised by large expanses of heather moorland,
such as Blanchland Moor (below).
Northumberland County Council helps to protect
the natural and industrial heritage of this area and promotes sustainable tourism.
In 1997, the unusual combination of a warm, dry May and a wet June
created ideal conditions for the heather to flower,
and it proved to be a particularly spectacular year.
HOUSING
Public Housing
Most social housing in Great Britain is
provided by local housing authorities—the
structure of local authorities in England,
Wales and Scotland is outlined on pp. 80-1.
Public housing is also provided by Scottish
Homes, which currently has a stock of about
29,000 houses. It is, however, in the process of
transferring its houses to alternative landlords
such as housing associations. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive is responsible for
the supply and management of public housing
there.
Public housing authorities in Great Britain
own about 4.5 million houses and flats; the
Northern Ireland Housing Executive has some
142,000 homes. Some local authorities no
longer have any housing stock, having
transferred all of it to housing associations.
Other authorities have transferred part of their
stock. By August 1997, 57 authorities had
transferred their stock, involving 250,000
properties and raising over £4,000 million in
private finance.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
modernising their housing stock from central
government grants, their own resources and
from loans from the Public Works Loan Board
(an independent statutory body) and private
sector financial organisations. They must
maintain housing revenue accounts on a ‘ring-
fenced’ basis to keep them separate from other
council funds. The Government grants
English and Welsh local authorities Housing
Revenue Account Subsidy, worth around
£3,900 million in 1997-98. In Scotland,
Housing Support Grant of about £15 million
is available in 1997-98 for those authorities
which are in deficit on their housing revenue
accounts.
Local authorities in England have been
allocated nearly £900 million in 1997-98
through the Housing Investment Programme.
Welsh authorities have been allocated £35
million. In Scotland, local authorities have
received net capital allocations amounting to
£172 million for investment in council homes.
The Northern Ireland Housing Executive’s
capital programme is financed mainly by
borrowing from government and receipts from
house sales; in 1997-98 borrowing will total
£53 million. Revenue expenditure is funded
from rental income and by a government
grant, which in 1997-98 is about £143 million.
Registered Social Landlords (RSLs)
RSLs, which are non-profit-making, are the
main suppliers of new low-cost housing for
rent and for sale to those on low incomes and
in the greatest housing need. Some provide
supported housing to meet the special needs of
those with, for example, learning difficulties
(mental handicap), drug and alcohol problems,
young people at risk and frail elderly people.
RSLs own, manage and maintain 1,091,000
homes in England, including 140,000 units of
sheltered accommodation (see p. 415) and
60,000 of supported housing.
In Great Britain new housing schemes
carried out by RSLs may qualify for Social
Housing Grant if the social landlord
concerned is one of about 2,230 registered
with the Housing Corporation (in England),
Scottish Homes or, in Wales, Tai Cymru.
These three organisations are statutory bodies
which regulate and pay grant to RSLs in their
respective parts of Great Britain. Broadly
similar assistance is available to RSLs in
Northern Ireland. The Housing Corporation’s
programme has provision for around £690
million in grants in 1997-98. Housing
Corporation funding will make possible an
additional 35,000 lettings for rent or shared
ownership in 1997—98.
For 1997-98, expenditure on Scottish
Homes’ development funding programme,
which includes grants to private developers and
landlords, is £208 million, while the target for
the amount of private finance attracted is £130
million. Tai Cymru is managing a net capital
programme of £60 million in 1997-98, with a
target of making 2,900 new homes available.
Government provision to the housing
association movement in Wales was £601
million between 1992-93 and 1996-97. Private
sector finance generated over the same period
reached £362 million.
Northern Ireland’s registered housing
associations are expected to start 1,450 units of
accommodation in 1997-98. They now have a
stock of about 17,150 units for rent. The
385
THE ENVIRONMENT
budget for building for rent is £43 million in
1997- 98, which, with an additional £19
million of private finance, will provide a
further 400 units of rented accommodation.
Government plans allow for total funding of
£284 million over the period 1993-94 to
1998- 99.
Tenants’ Rights
Local authority tenants in England, Scotland
and Wales have security of tenure and other
statutory rights, which are set out in the
Council Tenant’s Charter, In addition to the
right to buy (see p. 383), these include the
right to have certain urgent repairs done
quickly at no cost to themselves and the right
to be paid for improvements made when they
move home. Tenants must be kept closely
involved in the process of letting tenders to
manage council estates. They also have the
right to take over the running of their estates
through tenant management organisations
(TMOs). Over 140 TMOs are operational and
about 100 more are in the process of
development.
In England the rights which RSLs are
required to give their residents will, from early
1998, be set out in the rights standard of the
Housing Corporation’s regulatory standards,
and will be explained in a series of residents’
charters. The standard covers equal
opportunities, occupancy agreements,
information, consultation, participation and
influence, complaints, and redress. In Wales,
the rights of housing association tenants are
protected through the Tenants’ Guarantee,
issued by Tai Cymru, which covers matters
such as tenancy terms, principles for setting
rent levels, equal opportunities, information
and consultation. Similar non-statutory
guidance, based on arrangements agreed
between Scottish Homes and the Scottish
Federation of Housing Associations, has been
implemented in Scotland. In Northern
Ireland, the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland has issued a Tenants’
Guarantee, similar to the English and Welsh
versions, for tenants of registered housing
associations.
The Housing Association Tenants’
Ombudsman Service in England, under the
auspices of the Housing Corporation, allows
independent investigation of tenants’
complaints against their housing association,
giving them a right similar to that for council
tenants through the local government
ombudsman (see p. 84). Similar schemes have
been launched in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, and a scheme is due to be launched in
Wales in 1998.
Housing for Older People
Sheltered housing provides specialised
facilities for elderly people, such as common
and laundry rooms, alarm systems and
resident or non-resident warden support.
Increasing emphasis is being placed on
schemes to help them continue to live in their
own homes by, for example, adapting their
present homes to meet particular needs. In
England, government-funded home
improvement agencies help the elderly, people
with disabilities and those on low incomes to
carry out repairs and improvements to their
properties. Some £4.5 million of government
assistance will go to support 143 home
improvement agencies in 1997—98. Care and
Repair Ltd is the national co-ordinating and
monitoring body. Parallel arrangements apply
in Wales, where £976,000 of government
funding has been allotted to 243 home
improvement agencies in 1997—98, including
Care and Repair Cymru, the national body.
Corresponding provision is made for Scotland
under the Care and Repair scheme co¬
ordinated by Scottish Homes, which expects
to cover 600 homes in 1997-98 involving
capital expenditure of £610,000.
Rural Housing
Where there is a clear need for low-cost
housing in rural areas, local authorities can
permit housing in localities where development
would not normally be allowed, so long as the
new housing can be reserved to meet that need.
The Housing Corporation also funds a special
rural programme to build houses in villages
with a population of 3,000 or below; between
1989-90 and 1996-97 it approved funding from
this for the building of 13,500 such homes.
386
HOUSING
Tai Cymru has a major role in rural
housing provision, with about a quarter of its
programme devoted to rural areas. The Welsh
Office also supports low-cost schemes for
rural housing. In Scotland, considerable
progress is being made through a range of
initiatives as part of the Scottish Homes Rural
Strategy. Scottish Homes has invested £411
million in countryside areas between 1989-90
and 1996-97, providing 13,000 homes. In
1997-98 it will spend £40 million in rural
areas, making 900 homes available. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive operates
a rural strategy, involving action both in
public housing (new building and
improvements) and, through the house
renovation grant scheme, in private housing.
Improving Existing Housing
In urban areas of Britain, slum clearance and
redevelopment used to be major features of
housing policy, but there has been a trend in
recent years towards the modernisation and
conversion of sub-standard homes in order to
help maintain existing communities. Housing
conditions have improved considerably, but
problems remain in some areas where there are
concentrations of dwellings requiring
substantial repairs. In some cases, however,
clearance may still be the most satisfactory
course of action. To help overcome objections
to clearance, local authorities can pay a new
discretionary relocation grant to those displaced
by clearance to enable them to buy at least a
part share in a new home in the same area.
Social Housing
Run-down estates are being improved through
the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge
Fund, which encourages local partnerships in
England to tackle social and economic
problems, including housing improvements. A
£380 million Estate Renewal Challenge Fund
is being made available over three years to
help renovate poor-quality estates by speeding
their transfer to housing associations and other
new landlords. In all, 20 local authorities are
receiving finance to improve the condition of
41,000 homes.
In Wales, Estate Partnership funding is
used to combat the problem of run-down
estates; £10.6 million of central government
support has been allocated for this purpose in
1997-98, to supplement local authority and
private sector contributions. The
Government’s policy on urban regeneration in
Scotland is also based on the partnership
approach. In the Urban Partnerships in
Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paisley (see
p. 375), 3,180 new houses have been built and
another 5,510 refurbished.
Private Housing
The Government offers assistance through
house renovation grants to owners of private
housing who are on low incomes and unable to
afford necessary repairs and improvements.
Specific help is available to disabled people
needing adaptations to their homes. Grants
provide up to 100 per cent support for
essential repairs and improvements to the
poorest homeowners. In all, 529,700 grants
have been made in England since 1991,
totalling £2,563 million. In Wales some 64,000
grants were completed between April 1991
and March 1997, at a cost of £861 million. In
addition, some 32,000 minor works assistance
grants were completed at a cost of £26.5
million.
Scottish local authorities award grants for
improvement and repair. Scottish Homes also
has the power to provide grants to complement
the role of local authorities in private house
renewal. In Northern Ireland, funding is
allocated through the house renovation grants
scheme, administered by the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive, on a similar basis to that in
England and Wales. In isolated rural areas,
financial assistance to replace dwellings which
cannot be restored is also on offer under this
scheme. Legislation is being considered to
apply to Northern Ireland the principles of the
grants provisions of the Housing Grants,
Construction and Regeneration Act 1996.
Homelessness
Many people to whom local authorities owe a
housing duty have some form of
387
THE ENVIRONMENT
accommodation, even though it is often
temporary, overcrowded or otherwise
unsatisfactory. Those entitled to rehousing are
found accommodation by local authorities.
Local authorities have a legal duty to secure
accommodation for households which are
eligible for assistance and accepted as
unintentionally homeless and in priority need.
The latter category includes pregnant women,
people with dependent children, and those
who are vulnerable due to old age, mental or
physical handicap or other special reasons.
Legal provisions, which came into force in
England and Wales in 1997, reformed the law
on homelessness and the allocation of council
housing. The aim was to ensure fairer access
to long-term social housing by creating a
single route to such accommodation—the
local authority housing register—while
ensuring a safety net for families and
vulnerable people who lose their home
through no fault of their own. In Scotland, a
new code of guidance on homelessness was
issued in 1997, to which by law local
authorities must have regard in applying the
homelessness legislation in the Housing
(Scotland) Act 1997. Northern Ireland policy
on homelessness is under review and will take
account of any changes to policies or
legislation in England and Wales.
The Rough Sleepers Initiative was
established in 1990 in central London, where
the problem of people sleeping rough on the
streets was especially acute; it has a
government grant of £73 million for 1996-97
to 1998-99. So far the scheme has provided
about 1,150 places in short-term hostels
including places for clients with drink
problems, and at least 3,300 permanent and
970 leased places in ‘move-on’

accommodation. In addition, 40 beds in
permanent high-care accommodation for
people with mental ill health and a winter
shelter programme with approximately 400
beds each winter have been provided. The
Initiative has been extended to other areas in
England. In Bristol, 150 new permanent
homes, 24 beds in high-care accommodation,
40 hostel places, a winter shelter and
additional outreach and resettlement have
been provided. A voluntary sector count, held
in November 1996, found that 286 people
were sleeping rough in central London,
compared with estimates of over 1,000 people
before the Rough Sleepers Initiative began.
The Department of Health operates the
Homeless Mentally 111 Initiative to supply
accommodation and psychiatric care for
mentally ill people who have been sleeping
rough in central London and Bristol. It also
funds projects designed to ensure that
homeless people have access to health services.
A Scottish Rough Sleepers Initiative has been
introduced, inviting bids for expenditure in
the second half of 1997 and the following two
years. A total amount of £16 million over the
three years has been allocated. In addition, a
further £2 million has been allocated to tackle I
the problem of empty properties in Scotland
with a view to increasing the supply of
housing available to those in need.
The Government is providing £8 million
in 1997-98 to voluntary groups helping single
homeless people in England; grants of
£600,000 for 1997-98 are being made to
voluntary organisations tackling homelessness
in Scotland, and £623,000 in Wales. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive is

providing £367,000 to voluntary groups
involved with homelessness there.
Housing Advice
Under the Housing Act 1996, local authorities
have a duty to secure the provision of advice
to prevent homelessness. As well as housing
associations, other voluntary sector bodies
have a role to play in housing matters. Such
groups undertake a number of roles, for
example advising people about their rights
under housing law or encouraging energy
efficiency in the home. The Government
allocates grants to assist the work of such
bodies. In England the largest project
currently funded is the Homelessness Advice

Service, with £2 million in 1997-98; in
Scotland, aid worth £1.4 million in 1997-98 is
being given to about 25 voluntary bodies,

Service, for work on homelessness and other
housing matters. In Wales, £500,000 is being
provided to support national tenant
organisations and other bodies involved in
housing management education and training.
In Northern Ireland, the Government is
providing about £208,000 to the Housing
Rights Service, a voluntary organisation which
offers advice on all aspects of housing, and
£188,000 to the Northern Ireland Tenants
Action Project, which promotes the
participation of tenants in the management of
their homes.

Since taking office in May 1997, the Government has launched a new public
health strategy, setting goals for improving the overall health of the nation
which recognise the impact that poverty, poor housing, unemployment and a
polluted environment have on health. It has also announced reforms to reduce
the administrative costs of running the National Health Service (NHS), and has
commissioned a new hospital building programme. Three White Papers are to
be issued: two in late 1997, setting out a framework for the future of the NHS
and outlining the Government’s strategy for reducing smoking; and a third in
summer 1998, on the public health strategy.
The National Health Service (NHS) provides
a full range of medical services, available to all
residents, regardless of their income. Local
authority personal social services and
voluntary organisations provide help and
advice to the most vulnerable members of the
community—elderly, physically disabled and
mentally ill people, those with learning
disabilities, and children in need of care.
Central government is directly responsible
for the NHS, which is administered by a range
of health authorities and health boards
throughout Britain. The Secretary of State for
Health in England and the Secretaries of State
for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are
responsible for all aspects of the health
services in their respective territories. The
Department of Health is responsible for
national strategic planning in England, and
within that department, the NHS Executive—
with its eight regional offices—is responsible
for developing and implementing policies for
the provision of high quality health services.
The Scottish Office Department of Health,
the Welsh Office and the Department of
Health and Social Services in Northern
Ireland have similar responsibilities.
There are 100 health authorities in England
and 5 in Wales, 15 health boards in Scotland
and 4 health and social services boards in
Northern Ireland, all of which are responsible
for identifying the healthcare needs of the
people living in their area. They secure
hospital and community health services and
arrange for the provision of services by
doctors, dentists, pharmacists and opticians, as
well as administering their contracts. The
health authorities and boards co-operate
closely with local authorities responsible for
social work, environmental health, education
and other services. There are community
health councils (local health councils in
390
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Scotland and area health and social services
xmncils in Northern Ireland) covering all
?arts of the country, representing local
jpinion on the services provided.
Personal social services are administered by
ocal authorities but central government is
-esponsible for establishing national policies,
issuing guidance and overseeing standards,
foint finance and planning between health and
local authorities aims to prevent overlapping
af services and to encourage the development
af community services.
Major Policy Developments
PUBLIC HEALTH
The Existing Approach
The White Paper The Health of the Nation,
published by the previous administration in
1992, laid out a strategy for improving health
in England. It set targets for improvements in
the following areas:
• coronary heart disease and stroke (major
single causes of premature death in
England);
• cancers (now the biggest cause of death
across all ages);
• accidents (the commonest cause of death
in those under 30);
• mental illness (a leading cause of ill-
health and also a cause of many suicides);
and
• HIV/AIDS and sexual health.
Targets were set for reducing death rates,
ill-health, and behaviour that poses a risk to
health. In most areas there has been steady
progress towards the targets but in a few
cases—such as teenage smoking, obesity and
excess alcohol consumption in women—
figures are on the increase. Strategies have also
been developed for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland which reflect the health
variations in the different parts of Britain.
Central activity in England has included,
for example, interdepartmental taskforces on
| accident prevention, smoking, the workplace
and physical activity. At local level, agencies,
such as the NHS, local authorities, voluntary
organisations and the private sector, have been
encouraged to form ‘health alliances’. Good
practice in this kind of collaborative working
has been rewarded through the Health
Alliance Award scheme. Progress towards the
Health of the Nation targets has been
monitored regularly and formally reviewed,
and periodic progress reports published.
Similar initiatives have been taken in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Proposals for a New Public Health
Strategy
In July 1997 the Government outlined its
plans for a wide-reaching public health
strategy to tackle the underlying causes of ill
health. It proposes to set new goals for
improving the overall health of the nation by
recognising the impact that poverty, poor
housing, unemployment and a polluted
environment can have on health. Persistent
inequalities in health exist between different
occupational and ethnic groups, between
geographical areas and between men and
women in Britain. There is evidence that
people who live in disadvantaged
circumstances have more illness, greater
distress, and shorter lives than those who are
more affluent. The Government has said that
it hopes that by tackling the wider influences
on health it can have an impact on health
inequalities. Immediate action includes plans
to improve food safety (see chapter 18), to
discourage smoking (see p. 408), and to find
out more about the effects of air pollutants
commonly found in the home (see chapter 21).
The new Government considers there are
lessons to be learnt from the existing approach:
that it has been sensible to concentrate on the
biggest killers and causes of avoidable ill health.
It intends to continue to work towards the
existing targets, though some may need to be
modified. However, it thinks that the Health of
the Nation policy ignored health inequalities
and did little to promote collaboration across
government. It also failed to consider
population groups separately—children, the
working-age population, elderly people. By
focusing on disease and services, the policy cast
the burden back onto the NHS, and the
policy’s emphasis on lifestyle issues cast too
much responsibility back onto the individual.
391
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Government’s new approach to health
is marked by the appointment of a Minister
for Public Health, one of whose roles will be to
ensure that policies across government can be
evaluated for their potential impact on
people’s health: an agenda which challenges
every department of government.
The Government has stated that it intends
to produce a coherent strategy with clear
targets to guide action at local level, involving
health and local authorities as well as
voluntary organisations and community
groups, the private sector and individuals. It
plans to develop the health promoting roles of
the local authority departments dealing with
social services, education, housing, recreation,
public transport, traffic, environmental health
and consumer protection. A consultation
paper on the new strategy for England will be
published in late 1997. Similar action is being
taken in other parts of Britain.
The Government has commissioned an
independent review of the latest available
information on inequalities in health and
expectation of life in England. The review will
identify the priority areas in which the
Government needs to develop policy, and will
publish a report in 1998.
REFORMS IN MANAGEMENT
The Present System
Management reforms introduced under the
NHS and Community Care Act 1990 created a
form of competition in the running of the
NHS—the so-called ‘internal market’. This
was done by making a division between
purchasers and providers of health care.
Under this system:
Health authorities/health boards and some
general practitioners (GPs—see below) have
become purchasers, responsible for assessing
local health care needs and choosing between
rival providers to give patients the best
available service. Each health authority/health
board is now funded to buy health care for its
local residents through arranging contracts
with hospitals and other health service units in
either the public or the private sector.
Hospitals and other health service units (for
example, ambulance services and community
health services) have become providers.
Hospitals, which are now directly funded for
the number of patients they treat, have
become self-governing NHS Trusts,
independent of local health authority control
but remaining within the NHS. They are
accountable to the relevant health department,
and derive their income largely through
contracts to provide the services that health
authorities/health boards and GP fundholders
(see below) wish to buy.
Since 1990 GPs from larger medical
practices have been able to apply to join the
GP fundholding scheme, under which they
receive an annual budget directly from the
health authority/health board, enabling them
to choose between hospitals and consultants to
buy certain non-urgent hospital services for
their patients. More recently all GPs have
been able, if they wish, to hold a budget to buy i
community-based services, such as those of
district nurses, from NHS Trusts.
By April 1997 all NfiS hospitals in Britain j
(other than in the Scottish Islands) had
become Trusts, and over 50 per cent of
GPs—serving about 60 per cent of the
population—had become fundholders.
Broadly similar changes were introduced
under separate legislation in Northern Ireland,
where health and personal social services are
provided on an integrated basis by health and
social services boards.
The New Government’s Proposed
Reforms
Abolishing the Internal Market
In May 1997 the new Government announced
its decision to replace the ‘internal market’, in
which GP fundholders and health
authorities/health boards buy services from
NHS Trusts. It will set out its proposals for
replacing the internal market in a White Paper
in late 1997. The Government considers that
the excessive administrative costs of buying
care, with each transaction the subject of a
separate invoice, have undermined the
provision of care, and that the market system i
has distorted clinical priorities.
The Government considers that the
internal market has led to a two-tier health
service in which fundholding practices and
392
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
their patients enjoy unfair financial advantages
over non-fundholding practices, allowing
hospitals to give preference to fundholder
patients at the expense of other patients with
greater clinical need.
To address this problem, the Government
has announced measures aimed at ensuring
equality in waiting lists by giving priority to
patients solely on the basis of clinical need.
From April 1998—when current contracts run
out—all health authorities and their GPs will
have to establish common waiting-time
standards for all patients living in their area.
From the same date NHS Trusts will not be
allowed to offer preferential admission to the
patients of GP fundholders, and fundholders
will not be able to press for faster treatment
except on clinical or social grounds.
NHS Efficiency Task Force
In England the Government has begun to cut
the NHS administration budget—by £100
million in the current financial year—and has
redirected the funds into patient care, starting
with screening for women at risk of breast
cancer (see p. 410) and new intensive care
facilities for children (see p. 400). In June 1997
it set up a task force as part of its campaign to
redirect funds towards patient care. The task
force will explore more effective and efficient
ways of delivering patient care across the NHS
within the next 12 months.
Areas to be examined include, among others:
• the £500 million which health authorities
and Trusts spend each year with the
private sector, with consideration being
given to whether some of this could be
better spent with the NHS;
• the scope to bring forward plans to
dispose of land and buildings worth
£1,200 million over a five-year period;
• better use of clinically effective
techniques;
• the scope for further reductions in the
prices paid for utilities, such as water,
electricity and gas; and
• controlling growth in the NHS drugs
budget.
Health Action Zones
The Government is considering proposals for
targeting a small number of areas where it .
believes the health of local people could be
improved by better integrated arrangements
for treatment and care. The areas would be
designated ‘Health Action Zones’. Within
these zones, health authorities, NHS Trusts,
GPs, nurses, health visitors, midwives,
pharmacists, dentists, opticians and all others
involved in delivering NHS services at local
level, would be brought together to develop a
health strategy in partnership with local
authorities, community groups, the voluntary
sector, and local businesses. Working closely
with the Department of Health, the
participants would explore mechanisms for
breaking through current organisational
boundaries to tackle inequalities, and
delivering better services and better health
care, building upon and encouraging co¬
operation across the NHS. Funding for the
zones would be met from existing resources. A
similar initiative to encourage local health care
partnerships has been launched in Scotland.
Further details on the future framework of the
NHS will be set out in the White Paper to be
published in late 1997.
Review of London’s Health Services
A review of health services in London was
announced in June 1997. This will establish
the current state of services in the capital and
will review health authority and Trust plans,
including plans for capital investment, to
ensure that all residents have ready access to
high quality healthcare. The review will also
take account of the Government’s new
strategy to improve public health through
better health promotion and prevention (see
p. 391). It will report by autumn 1997. The
programme of hospital closures in London
carried out under the previous government
will be suspended during the period of the
review.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Health in England 1996
The 1996 Health in England report' was
published in May 1997. This was the second
in a series of annual studies monitoring
trends in the health-related knowledge,
attitudes and behaviour of adults in England.
Some of its findings show:
• 31 per cent of men and 29 per cent of
women were current cigarette smokers.
The average number of cigarettes
smoked each day was 12.9 for women
and 15.3 for men—no change from
1995. Almost two-thirds of current
smokers would like to give up smoking.
As in 1995, smokers aged 25 to 44 and
those who smoked 10 cigarettes or more
a day were most likely to want to quit.
• Alcohol consumption for both men
and women was higher in the 16 to 24
age group than in any other age group,
average consumption being 22.4 units
a week for men and 14.4 for women.
• 25 per cent of respondents were
classed as sedentary, that is, they took
part less than once a week in 30
minutes or more of exercise of
moderate intensity. Lack of time was
the most common reason given by
people when asked what stopped them
exercising more.
• 38 per cent of adults aged 16 to 74
reported eating bread; fruit, vegetables
or salad; and potatoes, rice or pasta
every day (important constituents in a
healthy diet). When asked about their
attitudes to diet, 32 per cent said they
were confused about ‘what is supposed
to be healthy and what isn’t’. Older
men were the most likely to say they
were confused.
- »
• 32 per cent of respondents aged 16 to
54 said they had at some time used
drugs which were not prescribed by a
doctor; 14 per cent had done so in the
past year and 9 per cent in the past
month. Drug use was most likely to be
reported by those aged 19 to 21. i
Seventy-four per cent of men and 50
per cent of women in this group said
they had at some time tried a drug. Of
the people who reported using a drug
in the past month, 18 per cent said
they intended to stop in the next
month. Ten per cent said they did not
see the need ever to stop taking drugs.
• Over a third of men and over a quarter |
of women aged 16 to 24 reported
having more than one sexual partner
in the 12 months before the interview,
compared with 6 per cent of men and
3 per cent of women in the 45 to 54
age group. When asked whether they
would use a condom with a new
partner, 67 per cent of women and 58
per cent of men said that they would
always do so, while 17 per cent of
women and 31 per cent of men said it
would ‘depend’. Only 1 per cent of
people said that they would never use
a condom. These findings do not
differ significantly from those
recorded in 1995.
• The proportion of people who thought
a suntan was important decreased *
slightly between 1965 and 1996, from
28 per cent to 25 per cent. The
prevalence of sunburn decreased with
age from 41 per cent of those aged 16
to 24 to only 8 per cent of those aged
65 to 74.

iDMINISTRATION
Expenditure
'he Health Programme is funded mainly by
entral government and consists of:
» NHS Hospital and Community Health
Services (HCHS), providing all hospital
care and a wide range of community
services;
i> NHS Family Health Services (FHS),
providing general medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and some ophthalmic
services, and covering the cost of
medicines prescribed by GPs;
* Central Health and Miscellaneous
Services (CHMS), providing services
most effectively administered centrally,
such as welfare food (which includes free
milk and vitamins to families with
children under five, and pregnant
women, on Income Support) and support
to the voluntary sector; and
» the administrative costs of the health
departments.
The Personal Social Services Programme

people, carers and people from ethnic
minorities, as well as those looking after
people with mental illness, physical or
learning disabilities, or suffering from the
effects of HIV/AIDS or the misuse of alcohol
or drugs. In Scotland central government
grants to voluntary organisations in social
welfare amounted, in 1996-97, to almost £9
million. In Northern Ireland the Department
of Health and Social Services spent £6.4
million in support of a wide range of voluntary
activity during 1996-97.
Health authorities/boards and local
authorities also make grants to local
organisations.
Finance
About 82 per cent of the cost of the health
service is paid for through general taxation.
The rest is met from:
• the NHS element of National Insurance
contributions (see chapter 25), paid by
employed people, their employers, and
self-employed people (12.2 per cent);
• charges towards the cost of certain items
such as drugs prescribed by family
395
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
doctors, and general dental treatment
(2.3 per cent);
• capital refunds to NHS Trusts (2.5 per
cent); and
• other receipts, including land sales and
the proceeds of income generation
schemes (0.9 per cent).
Health authorities may raise funds from
voluntary sources. Certain hospitals
increase revenue by taking private patients,
who pay the full cost of their
accommodation and treatment.
In 1996-97 an estimated 85 per cent of
medical prescription items were supplied free.
Prescription charges are not paid by:
• children under 16 years (or young people
under 19 who are in full-time education);
• pregnant women and women who have
had a baby in the past year;
• people aged 60 and over;
• patients with certain medical conditions;
• war and armed forces disablement
pensioners (for prescriptions which relate
to the disability for which they receive a
war pension); and
• people in families who are receiving
Income Support, income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance or Disability
Working Allowance (see chapter 25); and
people or families with low incomes.
Over 480 million prescriptions, worth
almost £4,000 million, are dispensed each year
in England and Wales.
There are proportional charges for most
types of NHS dental treatment, including
examinations. However, the following people
are entitled to free treatment: women who
begin a course of treatment while pregnant or
within 12 months of having a baby, children
up to 18, full-time students under 19; and
those who receive, or whose partners receive,
Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support or
Disability Working Allowance. Others on low
incomes may be entitled to free treatment or
to help with charges.
Since 1989 the availability of free NHS
sight tests has been restricted to children, full¬
time students under the age of 19, people in
A government report on prescription fraud
published in June 1997 has revealed that
between £70 million and £100 million in
England and Wales is lost each year
through prescription charge evasion and
some £15 million through theft and
forgery. The Government has announced
a number of measures to tackle this. These
include developing proposals for a new
criminal offence of evading prescription
charges; rewarding pharmacies for
detecting stolen or counterfeited
prescription forms; and greater use of
information technology to improve
investigation and detection of fraud by
NHS contractors.
families receiving Income Support, income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance or Disability
Working Allowance, and those at particular
risk of eye disease. Following a report by the
Royal National Institute for the Blind, which
suggested that since 1989 people have been
having their eyes tested less often, the
Government has announced that it will be
reviewing the current arrangements.
Family practitioners (doctors, dentists,
optometrists and community pharmacists) are ii
self-employed (or, in the case of pharmacists, jj|
employed by a pharmacy company) and have 'j
contracts with the NHS. GPs are paid by a
system of fees and allowances designed to
reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. Dentists providing treatment in
their own surgeries are paid by a combination
of set-rate fees for treating children,
continuing care payments for adults registered f
with the practice, and a prescribed scale of
fees for individual treatments. Community
pharmacists dispense from their own or their
company’s premises and are refunded the cost
of the items supplied, together with
professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service receive
approved fees for each sight test carried out.
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly 1 million
people. Staff costs account for approximately ^
70 per cent of current spending on hospitals '
and community health services. Figures for

to 6,642;
I the number of professional and technical
staff in England rose by 29 per cent to

was 27 per cent to 12,594;
i the number of nursing and midwifery

This reflects the growth in bursaried
students under the Project 2000 nurse
training scheme—see p. 412. (Project
2000 trainees have full student status and
are not NHS employees.) The change
masks an underlying trend of an increase
of 3 per cent in the number of qualified
nursing and midwifery staff since 1985.
In Scotland during the same period the
number of nursing and midwifery staff
rose by 2.7 per cent to 52,416—an
increase of 7.1 per cent since 1985;

maintenance and works staff fell from
183,400 to 102,400, while in Scotland
they fell from 29,015 to 14,106—the
sharp fall reflecting the continuing effect
of competitive tendering (see chapter 7,
p. 83). Many of these jobs are now
carried out by the private sector.
Openness in the NHS
The Code of Practice on Openness in the
M4S came into force in 1995. Designed to
nake NHS organisations more accountable
md provide greater public access to
information, the Code applies to NHS Trusts,
health authorities/boards and local health
practitioners such as GPs, dentists and
pharmacists. It sets out the information that
MHS Trusts and health
mthorities/health boards should publish or
otherwise make available.
The NHS Code contains, among other
things:
• information about what services are
provided, the targets and standards set
and results achieved, and the costs and
effectiveness of the service;
• details of important proposals on health
policies or proposed changes in the way
the services are delivered; and
• information about how people can have
access to their own personal health
records.
NHS Complaints System
Complaints about all NHS-funded services
are dealt with in a similar fashion at two
distinct levels.The procedures aim to resolve
complaints speedily at a local level; where
complainants are dissatisfied with the response
at local level, a new system of review by an
independent panel is an option. Patients can
refer complaints to the Health Service
Commissioner (see below) if they are
dissatisfied with the response from the NHS.
Health Service Commissioners
Health Service Commissioners (one each for
England, Scotland and Wales) are responsible
for investigating complaints directly from
members of the public about health service
bodies. The three posts are at present held by
one person (with a staff of about 250), who is
also Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman—see p. 70). As
Health Service Commissioner, he or she
reports annually to Parliament. In Northern
Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints has
a similar role.
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered hardship as a result of:
• a failure in a service provided by a health
service body;
• a failure to provide a service which the
patient was entitled to receive; or
maladministration by an NHS
authority—that is, something that the
397
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
NHS authority failed to do or did in the
wrong way.
Complaints must be sent to the
Commissioner in writing, and the health
service body concerned should first have been
given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
Legislation passed in 1996 extended the
Health Service Commissioner’s jurisdiction to
include complaints against all family health
service practitioners and their staff, and about
the exercise of clinical judgment.
In 1996-97 the Commissioner received a
record 2,219 complaints about the NHS—24
per cent more than the previous year. He
completed 238 investigations.
Patient’s Charters
Patient’s Charters set out the rights of patients
and the standards of service they can expect to
receive from the NHS. The responsibility for
implementing the Patient’s Charters rests with
all parts of the NHS, English regional offices
(see p. 390), and purchasers and providers of
services (see p. 392).
The original Patient’s Charter in England
came into force in 1992 and an expanded
version was issued in 1995, covering dental,
optical and pharmaceutical services and the
hospital environment. In England subsequent
leaflets have set out how the Patient’s Charter
applies to specific services. These are:
maternity services (published in 1994); a blood
donor’s charter (1995); services for children
and young people (1996), and mental health
services (1997).
In England the Patient’s Charter sets
national charter standards, which are not legal
rights but specific standards of service that the
NHS aims to provide. These cover respect for
the individual patient; waiting times for
ambulances, clinical assessment in Accident
and Emergency departments and
appointments in out-patient clinics; and
cancellation of operations. Separate but
similar Patient’s Charters have been developed
for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
All health authorities in England and health
boards and NHS Trusts in Scotland have also
produced local charters, with statements of the
standards of service patients can expect to
receive. GP practices are encouraged to
produce their own charters, setting out the
standards of service they offer their patients.
Planned Changes
The new Government sees the existing
Charter as simplistic, concentrating too much
on the easily measurable. It considers that it
fails to give proper weight to the quality of
clinical care and patients’ own experiences of
how well the service has been delivered. The
existing Patient’s Charter will remain in place
for the time being, but the Government
intends to make changes to its current
provisions. In particular from October 1997 it
plans to introduce in England a new national
standard on immediate assessment in Accident
and Emergency departments of hospitals to
ensure that patients are properly assessed, and
treated according to clinical priority.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The Family Health Services are those given to
patients by doctors (GPs), dentists, opticians
and pharmacists of their own choice. They
remain the first point of contact most people
have with the NHS. Every year there are
about 250 million consultations with GPs and
about 6 million people visit a pharmacy every
day. Often those who visit their GP or dentist
need no clinical treatment but healthy lifestyle
counselling and preventive health care advice
instead. The last decade has seen continued
growth of the Family Health Services in line
with longstanding government policy to build
up and extend these services in order to
improve health and relieve pressure on the far
more costly secondary care sector (that is,
hospital and specialist services).
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case
of illness, give advice and may prescribe a
suitable course of treatment or refer a patient
to the more specialised services and hospital
consultants. About four-fifths of GPs in
Britain work in partnerships or group
practices. Primary healthcare teams also
include health visitors and district nurses,
midwives, and sometimes social workers and
other professional staff employed by the
health authorities. Most GPs in Great Britain
and about half in Northern Ireland work in
398
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
health centres. As well as providing medical
and nursing services, health centres may also
have facilities for health education, family
planning, speech therapy, chiropody,
assessment of hearing, physiotherapy and
remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical
and ophthalmic services, hospital out-patient
and supporting social work services may also
be provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary health care staff in recent years. For
example, between 1986 and 1996 the number
of GPs in England rose by 9 per cent (to
29,000); and average patient list size fell by 8
per cent (to just under 1,900). During the
same period, however, the number of GP
trainees fell by 21 per cent.
Special funds have been earmarked by the
Government for improving the quality of
primary health care in some inner city areas.
Planned Improvements in Primary Care
In recent years GPs have gained powers on
behalf of their patients in a changed
relationship with consultants. The new
Government acknowledges that the GP
fundholding schemes have produced benefits
in terms of improved patient care and is keen
to work in partnership with them to build
better services. It intends to retain the lead
role for primary care but remove the
disadvantages that have come from the present
system. Details of the Government’s plans for
primary care will be set out in the White Paper
on the future of the NHS to be published in
late 1997.
Primary Care Pilot Schemes
The NHS (Primary Care) Act, passed in
March 1997, has introduced greater flexibility
in the delivery of primary health care services
for patients. It enables GPs, dentists, NHS
Trusts and NHS employees to work with
health authorities and health boards to develop
new ways of delivering primary care under
local contracts.
In July 1997 the Government announced
plans to set up a number of pilot schemes under
the NHS (Primary Care) Act. Two types of
scheme are proposed, both to be sited in areas
which experience high levels of illness and where
there are often problems in recruiting GPs:
• The first type of scheme will enable
NHS Trusts or GP practices to employ
GPs on a salaried basis. (At present GPs
are employed on individual contracts.)
This is designed to give patients in areas
of high health risk access to a flexible
family doctor service on their doorstep.
• The second type of scheme will create
primary health care ‘one-stop shops’,
where GPs, community nurses and other
professionals work as a single team in the
community offering a range of services
from eye tests to lay counselling.
The Government has received over 500
proposals from health professionals interested
in taking part in the projects. About 200 of the
applications are expected to be chosen to
become pilot schemes in April 1998. Proposals
for pioneering schemes to improve primary
care dentistry will be announced shortly and
the first schemes are expected to come into
operation from October 1998.
Pilot Schemes for GP Locality Commissioning
From April 1998 the Government will run
about 20 pilot schemes throughout England
which will test new approaches to securing
high-quality health services for all patients in
their areas. The pilot schemes will bring
together GPs and other primary care
professionals, in partnership with their health
authority, to explore how each can best play
their part in developing a local health strategy
and putting it into practice together with local
NHS Trusts and the wider community.
Reflecting the Government’s commitment to
local flexibility, the schemes will be chosen to
cover a range of areas and approaches.
Midwives, Health Visitors and District
Nurses
Midwives provide care and support to women
throughout pregnancy, birth and the postnatal
period (up to 28 days after the baby is born).
Midwives work in both hospital and
community settings.
399
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Under a number of pilot schemes in
England and Scotland, district nurses and
health visitors are able to prescribe from a
limited list of drugs and medical appliances.
These schemes, based in GP practices, are
intended to reduce significantly the time
patients have to wait for relief of their
symptoms. Nurse prescribing will be extended
throughout the country from April 1998.
Health visitors are responsible for the
preventive care and health promotion of
families, particularly those with young
children. They have a public health role,
identifying local health needs and working
closely with GPs, district nurses and other
professions. District nurses give skilled
nursing care to people at home or elsewhere
outside hospital; they also play an important
role in health promotion and education.
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
District general hospitals offer a broad range
of clinical specialities, supported by a range of
other services such as anaesthetics, pathology
and radiology. Almost all have facilities for the
admission of emergency patients, either
through Accident and Emergency
departments or as direct referrals from GPs.
Treatments are provided for in-patients, day
cases, out-patients and patients who attend
wards for treatment such as dialysis. Some
hospitals also provide specialist services which
cover more than one region or district. These
are known in England as supra-regional or
supra-district services covering, for example,
heart and liver transplants, and craniofacial
services and rare eye and bone cancers. (In
Scotland similar services are contracted for
centrally.) There are also specialist hospitals
such as the world-famous Hospital for Sick
Children at Great Ormond Street, Moorfields
Eye Hospital, and the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery, all in London.
These hospitals combine specialist treatment
facilities with the training of medical and other
students, and international research.
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were
built in the 19th century; some trace their
origins to much earlier charitable
foundations. Much has been done to improve
and extend existing hospital buildings and
many new hospitals have been or are being
opened. Recent policy has been to provide a
balanced hospital service centred around a
district general hospital, complemented as
necessary by smaller, locally based hospitals
and facilities.
Private Finance Initiative
The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) was
launched in 1992 to promote partnership
between the public and private sectors on a
commercial basis (see chapter 11). In the
health service it involves the use of private
finance in NHS capital projects for the design,
construction and operation of buildings and
support services. The new Government has
stated that it is determined to make the PFI
work, and in May 1997 introduced legislation
designed to reinvigorate the system by
clarifying powers of NHS Trusts to sign PFI
agreements. Following a review of major PFI
acute hospital building schemes in England, in
July 1997 it announced a major new hospital
building programme. Under this, 14 major
acute hospital schemes in England—with a
capital value of around £ 1,300 million—have
been approved to proceed. Two major PFI
schemes in Wales worth around £15 million
and 13 worth £646 million in Scotland are also
proceeding. The hospitals will be designed,
built, maintained and owned by the private
sector, which will lease the completed facilities
back to the NHS. Clinical services will
continue to be provided by NHS staff, and the
NHS will remain in control of the key
planning and clinical decisions.
The Government is currently reviewing the
PFFs procurement process and also its
application and will report its findings at the
beginning of 1998.
Mobile Intensive Care Service for
Children
In July 1997 the Government announced
plans to improve paediatric intensive care
(PIC) services in England. These include the
development of a 24-hour retrieval service, to
ensure that critically ill children needing
transfer to a PIC unit are accompanied by
400
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
doctors and nurses trained in paediatric
intensive care. The Government has provided
funding of £5 million for 1997-98 to assist in
improving PIC services in England.
Greater Accountability for NHS Trusts
Each NHS Trust (see p. 392) is run by a board
of executive and non-executive directors.
Trusts are free to employ their own staff and
set their own rates of pay, although staff
transferring to Trust employment retain their
existing terms and conditions of service.
Trusts are also free to carry out research and
provide facilities for medical education and
other forms of training. They may treat
private patients to generate income provided
this does not interfere with NHS obligations.
In June 1997 the new Government
announced that it would in future require all
Trust board meetings to be open to the public.
It has also taken measures to make boards
more representative of the local communities
they serve, by ensuring that appointments
procedures include representatives of ordinary
NHS users, patients and carers.
Organ Transplantation
The United Kingdom Transplant Support
Service Authority (a Special Health Authority
of the NHS), provides a 24-hour support
service to all transplant units in Britain for the
matching and allocation of organs for
transplant. During 1996, 1,683 kidney
transplants were performed. A similar service
exists for corneas and, in 1996, over 2,600
were transplanted. .
There are eight designated heart transplant
centres in England, and one in Scotland.
Programmes for lung and combined heart and
lung transplantation are in progress and in
1996, 291 heart, 117 lung, and 53 heart/lung
transplants were performed. The world’s first
combined heart, lungs and liver transplant
operation was carried out at Papworth in 1987.
There are six designated liver transplant units
in England and one in Scotland. In 1996, over
600 liver transplants were performed.
A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their willingness to
become organ donors in the event of their
death. The NHS Organ Donor Register, a
computer database of those willing to be organ
donors, was launched in 1994. By June 1997 it
contained over 4 million names.
Commercial dealing in organs for
transplantation is illegal.
Blood Transfusion Services
Blood transfusion services are run by the
National Blood Authority in England, the
Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service,
the Welsh Blood Service and the Northern
Ireland Blood Transfusion Agency. Britain is
self-sufficient in blood and blood products.
In England alone around 2.4 million
donations are given each year by voluntary
unpaid donors and separated into many
different life-saving products for patients. Red
cells, platelets and other products with a
limited ‘shelf life’ are prepared at blood
centres. The production of plasma products is
undertaken at the Bio Products Laboratory in
Elstree (Hertfordshire) and the Protein
Fractionation Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the four national bodies co-ordinates
programmes for donor recruitment, retention
and education, and donor sessions are organised
regionally, in towns, villages and workplaces.
Donors are normally aged between 18 (17 in
Scotland) and 65. Blood centres are responsible
for blood collection, screening, processing and
supplying hospital blood banks. They also
provide wide-ranging laboratory, clinical,
research, teaching and advisory services and
facilities. These are subject to nationally co¬
ordinated quality audit programmes.
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free
of charge for cases of sudden illness or collapse,
for accidents and for doctors’ urgent calls.
Rapid response services, in which paramedics
use cars and motorcycles to reach emergency
cases, have been introduced in a number of
areas, particularly London and other major
cities with areas of high traffic density.
Helicopter ambulances serve many parts of
England and an integrated air ambulance
service is available throughout Scotland.
401
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Non-emergency patient transport services
are available free of charge to NHS patients
considered by their doctor (or dentist or
midwife) to be medically unfit to travel by
other means. The principle applied is that each
patient should be able to reach hospital in a
reasonable time and in reasonable comfort,
without detriment to his or her medical
condition. In many areas the ambulance service
organises volunteer drivers to provide a
hospital car service for non-urgent patients.
Patients who are on, or dependants of people
on, Income Support or Disability Working
Allowance are eligible for reimbursement of
costs of travelling to hospital. People on low
incomes may also be eligible.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation services are available for
elderly, young, and mentally ill people, and
for those with physical or learning disabilities
who need such help to resume life in the
community. These services are offered in
hospitals, centres in the community and in
people’s own homes through co-ordinated
work by a range of professionals.
Medical services may provide free artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical
supports, wheelchairs, and other appliances.
Following assessment, very severely physically
disabled patients may be provided with
environmental control equipment which
enables them to operate devices such as alarm
bells, radios and televisions, telephones, and
heating appliances. Nursing equipment may
be provided on loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of
facilities to help patients in the transition from
hospital to their own homes. These include the
provision of equipment; help with cleaning,
shopping and cooking; care from domestic help
workers; and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers.
Voluntary organisations also provide services,
complementing the work of the statutory
agencies and widening the range of services.
Hospices
Hospice or palliative care is a special type of
care for people whose illness may no longer be
curable; it enables them to achieve the best
possible quality of life during the final stages.
The care may be provided in a variety of
settings: at home (with support from specially
trained staff), in a hospice or palliative care
unit, in hospital or at a hospice day centre.
Hospice or palliative care focuses on
controlling pain and other distressing
symptoms and providing psychological
support to patients, their families and friends,
both during the patient’s illness and into
bereavement.
Palliative care was first developed in Britain
in 1967 by the voluntary hospices and
continues to be provided by them in many
areas, but is now also provided within NHS
palliative care units, hospitals and community
services.
Hospices and palliative care services mostly
help people with cancer, although patients
with other life-threatening illnesses are also
cared for. There are also several hospices
providing respite care for children from birth
to 16 years of age.
The National Council for Hospices and
Specialist Palliative Care Services is an
umbrella organisation which brings together
both voluntary and health service providers in
order to provide a co-ordinated view of the
service and work; it covers England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. Its Scottish counterpart
is the Scottish Partnership Agency for
Palliative and Cancer Care.
Private Medical Treatment
Some NHS hospitals share expensive
equipment with private hospitals, and NHS
patients are sometimes treated (at public
expense) in the private sector where it is
considered that this will represent value for
money. The scale of private practice in
relation to the NHS is, however, relatively
small.
It has been estimated that about three-
quarters of those receiving acute treatment
in private hospitals or NHS hospital pay
beds are funded by health insurance
schemes, which make provision for private
health care in return for annual
subscriptions. Over 3 million people
subscribe to such schemes, about half of
402
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
them within group schemes, some arranged
by firms on behalf of employees.
Subscriptions often cover more than one
person (for example, members of a family);
about 11 per cent of the population in
Britain is covered by private medical
insurance. A survey carried out in 1994
showed that 36 per cent of households with
an annual gross income of £26,000 or more
had private medical insurance, compared
with only 3 per cent of those with an annual
gross income of less than £8,000. Those on
higher incomes were also more likely to have
the majority of the costs of their private
medical insurance met by their employer.
In July 1997 the Government announced
that it would abolish the tax relief given for
premiums on private health insurance paid
by people aged 60 and over. In 1996-97
approximately 550,000 people aged over 60
received this tax relief at the cost of some
£110 million.
Many overseas patients come to Britain
for treatment in private hospitals and
clinics, and Harley Street in London is an
internationally recognised centre for medical
consultancy.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided under
the NHS to safeguard the health of pregnant
women and of mothers with young children.
Services include free dental treatment; health
education; and vaccination and immunisation
of children against certain infectious diseases
(see p. 409).
A woman is entitled to care throughout her
pregnancy, the birth and the postnatal period.
Care may be provided by a midwife, a
community-based GP, a hospital-based
obstetrician, or a combination of these. The
birth may take place in a hospital maternity
unit, a midwife/GP-led unit, or at home.
After the birth, a midwife will visit until the
baby is at least ten days old and after that a
health visitor’s services are available.
Throughout her pregnancy and for the first
year of her baby’s life, a woman is entitled to
free prescriptions and dental care.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance is provided for pre-school
children in clinics run by the community
health trusts, and increasingly by GPs. This
enables doctors, deptists and health visitors to
oversee the physical and mental health and
development of pre-school children.
Information on preventive services is given
and in some clinics welfare foods are
distributed. The school health service offers
health care and advice for schoolchildren,
including medical and dental inspection and
treatment where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or emotional
problems. In recent years special efforts have
been made to improve co-operation between
the community-based child health services
and local authority education and social
services for children. This is particularly
important in the prevention of child abuse and
for the health and welfare of children in care
(see p. 418).
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
Britain in 1978, as a result of the technique of
in vitro fertilisation. This opened up new
horizons for helping with problems of
infertility and for the science of embryology.
The social, ethical and legal implications
were examined by a committee of inquiry
under Baroness Warnock (1984) and led
eventually to the passage of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, one
of the most comprehensive pieces of
legislation on assisted reproduction and
embryo research in the world.
The Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA), set up under the 1990 Act,
licenses and controls centres providing certain
infertility treatments, undertaking human
embryo research or storing gametes or
embryos. The HFEA maintains a code of
practice giving guidance to licensed centres
and reports annually to Parliament.
The law prohibits surrogacy arrangements
made on a commercial basis and prohibits any
advertising concerning surrogacy. An
independent review of aspects of surrogacy
law was set up in June 1997. Its terms of
reference are to consider whether payments,
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
including expenses, to surrogate mothers
should continue to be allowed and, if so, on
what basis; to examine whether there is a case
for regulating surrogacy arrangements
through a recognised body; and, in the light of
the above, to advise whether changes are
needed to the present legislation.
Ethical Issues
The Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing
was set up in 1996 to consider the ethical,
social and scientific aspects of genetic testing.
In November of the same year the Committee
issued for consultation a draft code of practice
on genetic testing supplied to the public; the
document was published in September 1997.
The establishment of a Human Genetic
Advisory Commission was announced in 1996,
and met for the first time in February 1997.
The Commission will take a broad view of
developments in human genetics and foster
public confidence in its application.
Family Planning
Free family planning advice and treatment is
available from GPs or from family planning
clinics. Clinics are also able to provide
condoms and other contraceptives free of
charge. The Government’s public health
strategy aims to ensure the provision of
effective family planning services for those
who want them.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, a
time limit of 24 weeks applies to the largest
category of abortion—risk to the physical or
mental health of the pregnant woman—and
also to abortion because of a similar risk to any
existing children of her family. There are three
categories in which no time limit applies: to
prevent grave permanent injury to the physical
or mental health of the woman; where there is a
substantial risk of serious foetal handicap; or
where continuing the pregnancy would involve
a risk to the life of the pregnant woman greater
than if the pregnancy were terminated. The
Act does not apply in Northern Ireland.
In 1996:
• the number of legal abortions in England
and Wales rose by 8.3 per cent to 177,225
compared with 163,638 in 1995;
• abortions on women resident in England
and Wales increased by 13,333 to
167,648, an increase of 8.6 per cent
compared with 1995;
• abortions carried out under the NHS
increased by 12,570 (11.5 per cent) to
121,512, while non-NHS abortions also
increased: by 1,017 (1.9 per cent) to
55,713; and
• abortions for non-resident women rose
by 254 to 9,577, an increase of 2.7 per
cent. These abortions represented 5.4 per
cent of all abortions carried out in
England and Wales.
Drug Misuse
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines, is a serious social and
health problem, and the new Government is
making the fight against such misuse a
priority. It is reviewing current anti-drugs
work and will be drawing up a new drugs
strategy for England. (See chapter 8 for details
of the present drugs strategy, including the
work of Drug Action Teams). A separate drug
and alcohol strategy for Wales was launched in
1996. It involves a drug and alcohol unit (see
below), an advisory committee on drug and
alcohol misuse, and five drug and alcohol
action teams, one in each Welsh health
authority area.
Research on various aspects of drug misuse
is funded by several government departments.
The Government is advised on matters
relating to drug misuse and connected social
problems by the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs (in Scotland the Scottish
Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse).
Prevention
Government national mass media publicity
campaigns have been run since 1985 to
persuade young people not to take drugs,
and to advise parents, teachers and other
404
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
professionals on how to recognise and
combat the problem. Since 1991-92 the
focus has changed to give greater emphasis
to locally based campaigns and includes
work on solvent misuse. A £5 million-a-year
publicity campaign, which aims to increase
public awareness of the risks of drug-taking,
was launched in 1995 and will run until
1998.
The Home Office Drugs Prevention
Initiative provides funding for local drugs
prevention teams in 12 areas in England.
The teams aim to show what local
communities working together can do to
tackle problems associated with drugs
misuse. The 1997-98 budget for the
Initiative is some £2 million and funding
will continue until March 1999. At present
over 70 local projects are being
implemented. They are aimed at young
people (including some projects within the
criminal justice system designed to confront
the links between drugs and crime); at
parents; and at whole communities. The
Initiative is underpinned by an extensive
programme of research and the findings will
be made widely available to enable people at
all levels to take action within the
community against drug misuse.
In Wales the Welsh drug and alcohol unit
has prepared a drug prevention action plan,
and a prevention campaign was launched in
1997.
The Government makes funds available
through local education authorities in England
and Wales to provide in-service training for
teachers involved in drug-prevention work in
schools. As part of the National Curriculum in
England and Wales (see chapter 26), children
in primary and secondary schools receive
education on the dangers of drug misuse. A
circular on drug prevention and schools,
containing guidance to help schools provide
effective drug education programmes, was
issued in 1995.
Separate measures have been introduced in
Scotland to discourage drug misuse through
publicity campaigns and action in the
education service and the community. Some
£3 million has been made available to the
Scotland Against Drugs Campaign, launched
in 1996. This initiative aims to deliver a
fundamental change in attitudes to drugs and
personal responsibility, closely involving both
the business community and the media.
National Drugs Helpline
A national drugs and solvents telephone
helpline provides a 24-hour free confidential
advice, counselling and information service
throughout Britain to anyone concerned about
the health implications of drugs or solvent
misuse. The telephone number is 0800 77 66 00.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
Treatment for drug dependence includes:
residential detoxification and rehabilitation;
community drug dependency services; needle
and syringe exchange schemes to combat the
spread of HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne
infections; advice and counselling; and after¬
care and support services. Facilities are
provided by both statutory and independent
agencies.
A task force set up to review the
effectiveness of treatment services for drug
misusers in England reported in May 1996. It
recommended that:
• services which are a first point of contact
for drug misusers should offer basic
health checks;
• the process of ‘shared care’ with
appropriate support for GPs should be
made available as widely as possible;
• steps should be taken to ensure drug
misusers who inject or are at risk of
injecting have better access to Hepatitis B
vaccinations; and
• counselling and support services should
be recognised as core components of drug
treatment and not as subsidiary to other
treatments.
The total amount available to health
authorities in England for drug treatment
services in 1997-98 is over £37 million. In
addition, a grant is payable each year to local
authorities to enable them to support
voluntary organisations providing services to
drug and alcohol misusers. In Scotland, £9.8
million is being made available in 1997-98 for
405
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the support of drug misuse and drug-related
HIV/AIDS services.
An increasing number of GPs treat drug
misusers, but only a limited number of doctors
are licensed to prescribe certain controlled
drugs to them, such as heroin and cocaine.
However, any doctor may prescribe methadone
as a substitute drug for drug misusers. All
doctors must notify the authorities of any
patient they consider to be addicted to certain
controlled drugs, and guidelines on good
medical practice in the treatment of drug
misuse have been issued to doctors.
Other Services
A number of non-statutory agencies work with,
and complement, health service provision.
Advice and rehabilitation services, including
residential facilities, for example, are provided
by many voluntary organisations. Support in
the community is provided by the probation
service and local social services departments
(social work departments in Scotland).
Solvent Misuse
Government policy aims to prevent solvent
misuse through educating young people,
parents and professionals about the dangers
and signs of misuse, and, where practicable,
restricting the sales of solvent-based liquefied
gas and aerosol products to young people.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it
is an offence to supply such substances to
children under 18 if the supplier knows or has
reason to believe they are to be used to induce
intoxication. In Scotland proceedings can be
taken under the common law.
The Department of Health funds a
hospital-based unit in London to collect and
publish annual mortality statistics associated
with solvent misuse. The statistics for 1995
show the number of deaths having risen to 68,
an increase over the 58 deaths in 1994, which
had been the lowest since 1981.
Alcohol Misuse
Alcohol is consumed by over 90 per cent of
the adult population. In 1994, 27 per cent of
men and 13 per cent of women in England and
Wales were drinking above the then
recommended sensible limits (21 units a week
for men and 14 units for women). In England
alone, this is the equivalent of around 9
million adults. Between 8.8 and 14.8 million
working days each year are lost through
alcohol-related absence. The most widely
accepted estimate of the cost of alcohol misuse
in England and Wales is £2,700 million a year.
The Government seeks to tackle alcohol-
related problems through a co-ordinated
programme of action across government
departments, and involving health and local
authorities, the independent sector, employers
and the alcohol industry.
Concern over alcohol misuse by young
people was heightened following the
appearance on the market from mid-1995 of a
range of new alcoholic drinks known as
‘alcopops’. After examining the measures
needed to prevent or inhibit the inappropriate
marketing, promotion and sale of alcoholic
drinks to those aged under 18, in July 1997 the
Government set out the action it expected the
alcohol industry to take in order to tackle the
problem over the coming year.
Part of the funds allocated to the Health
Education Authority (see p. 410) are for
promoting the sensible drinking message in
England, and equivalent bodies are similarly
funded in other parts of Britain. In Scotland,
pilot projects have been launched at local level
to tackle underage drinking.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the
NHS include in-patient and out-patient
services in general and psychiatric hospitals
and specialised alcoholism treatment units.
Primary care teams (GPs, community
psychiatric nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing treatment
and rehabilitation in hostels, day centres and
advisory services also play an important role.
The development of services to help
problem drinkers and their families is being
taken forward within the framework of
community care. Local authorities are required
to identify the need for alcohol misuse services
in their area, and to list the services provided
in their community care plans (see p. 414).
They are then responsible for arranging for the
needs of individuals with alcohol problems to
406
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
be assessed, and for buying an appropriate
course of care.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. In
England the voluntary agency Alcohol
Concern plays a prominent role in improving
services for problem drinkers and their
families; increasing public awareness of alcohol
misuse and harm-free drinking; and improving
training for professional and voluntary
workers.
Between 1990-91 and 1997-98 a total
government contribution of £9 million was ..
allocated to Alcohol Concern for improving
and extending the network of care, advisory
and counselling services. In addition, a grant of
£2.5 million is being paid to local authorities
during 1997-98 to help voluntary agencies
improve and extend provision for alcohol and
drug misusers in England. The Scottish
Council on Alcohol undertakes similar work in
Scotland. Research and surveys on various
aspects of alcohol misuse are funded by several
government departments.
Smoking
Cigarette smoking is the greatest single cause
of preventable illness and death in Britain. It is
associated with around 120,000 premature
deaths a year and costs the NHS an estimated
£610 million a year for the treatment of
related diseases (for example, heart disease,
lung cancer and bronchitis). In Scotland alone,
for example, over 10,600 people die each year
as a result of their smoking—that is, one in six
of all deaths in Scotland. The largest increase
in smoking rates is seen in teenagers and
especially girls (see p. 408). Studies of
smoking in pregnancy shows a relationship
between maternal smoking and the risk of
sudden infant deaths as well as low birth
weight in infants.
Education on the harmful effects of smoking
is included in the National Curriculum for all
pupils in publicly maintained schools in
England and Wales. A new three-year anti¬
smoking campaign for teenagers was launched
in July 1996, with extensive magazine
advertising. In response, over 175,000 young
people applied for an information pack about
smoking and adopting a positive alternative
lifestyle. In Scotland the Health Education
Board for Scotland (see p. 410) operates a free
telephone helpline, ‘Smokeline’, which has
received almost 318,300 calls since 1992. The
Board is spending some £610,000 on smoking
initiatives in 1997-98. Its telephone number is
0800 84 84 84.
The Government also supports the work of
the voluntary organisation Action on Smoking
and Health (ASH), whose services include a
workplace consultancy, offering advice and
help to employers in formulating anti-smoking
policies.
The Tobacco Control Alliance, founded in
1994 and supported by over 40 organisations,
calls for a concerted effort to eliminate tobacco
use in Britain, to create an environment where
children are relieved of the pressure to start
smoking, and to encourage and help smokers
to stop.
Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Controls
All tobacco advertising is banned on television,
and cigarette advertisements are banned on
radio. At present other forms of advertising and
promotion of tobacco products are regulated by
two voluntary agreements between the
Government and the tobacco industry.
The first agreement bans tobacco advertising
in cinemas and in young women’s magazines. It
prohibits outdoor poster advertising within 200
metres of schools; places an upper limit on
poster advertising expenditure; and bans all
permanent shopfront advertising. It also
requires that government health warnings
appear on all tobacco advertising, alerting the
consumer to the risks associated with smoking.
The second voluntary agreement, on sports
sponsorship by tobacco firms, covers levels of
spending, restrictions on sponsorship of events
chiefly for spectators under 18 years, and
controls over the siting of advertising at
televised events.
The health warnings which appear on
packets of tobacco products are governed by law
and not by voluntary agreement. Packets of
cigarettes and rolling tobacco must carry one of
six specified health warnings (for example,
‘smoking causes cancer’). All tobacco products
must also carry the warning ‘tobacco seriously
damages health’.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Smoking among Secondary School
Children 1996
The preliminary results of a government
survey of smoking among children in
England and Scotland aged 11 to 15 were
published in July 1997. This was the latest
in a series of national surveys carried out
every two years since 1982.
• In England in 1996 13 per cent of
secondary school children aged 11 to
15 were regular smokers (that is,
smoking at least one cigarette a week),
compared with 10 per cent in 1986.
Throughout the 1990s girls have been
more likely to smoke than boys, and in
1996 11 per cent of boys and 15 per
cent of girls were regular smokers.
• In Scotland 14 per cent of 12 to 15
year-olds were smokers in 1996
compared with 12 per cent in 1986.
Up to 1996 the overall prevalence of
smoking among boys in Scotland was
lower than among girls, and had
remained at about the same level since
the mid-1980s. The overall increase in
1996 was mainly due to the rise in the
proportion of boys who were smokers,
from 11 per cent in 1994 to 14 per cent
in 1996.
• Very few children are smokers when
they start secondary school, but, by
the time they are 15, about three out
of every ten in England and Scotland
smoke at least one cigarette a week.
Legislative Proposals
The Government is to publish a White Paper in
late 1997 setting out its strategy for reducing
smoking, and therefore reducing smoking-
related disease and death, using every possible
lever of government—changes in the law,
taxation, education and publicity. As an
essential first step, it intends to introduce
legislation to ban tobacco advertising altogether.
As one immediate measure aimed at
reducing tobacco consumption, the
Government is to raise the tax payable on
cigarettes by 5 per cent in real terms from
December 1997.
AIDS
Up to the end of June 1997 a total of 14,431
cases of AIDS had been reported in Britain, of
whom 9,937 (69 per cent) were homosexual or
bisexual males. The total number of
recognised HIV infections was 29,599, of
whom 24,942 (85 per cent) were male. The
majority—17,489 (59 per cent)—were
homosexual or bisexual males, but 5,804 (20
per cent) were heterosexual non-injecting
drug users.
The latest report of the monitoring
programme in England and Wales2 (published
in December 1996) confirms that HIV
infection is found throughout England and
Wales among those groups at greatest risk, but
rates are much higher in London than
elsewhere. Transmission is still occurring in
some homosexual/bisexual men, and injecting
drug users are still taking part in high-risk
behaviour, with younger users and women in
particular sharing injecting equipment.
Prevalence in pregnant women in London has
remained relatively high at one in 556. The
results of this monitoring are used to plan
services, inform policy and develop
HIV/AIDS projections.
Government Strategy
Key elements of the Government’s strategy
include:
• encouraging appropriate behaviour
change by increased targeting of sections
of the population at particular risk,
including homosexual and bisexual men
and drug misusers;
• sustaining and improving general public
awareness;
• continuing to make HIV testing facilities
more widely known, and encouraging
health authorities to commission
additional accessible HIV testing sites;
and
• continued funding for the voluntary
sector.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
A concerted approach is being maintained,
spanning government, the NHS, local
authorities and the voluntary sector (including
women’s groups, religious communities and
organisations working with ethnic minorities).
In England NHS funding for HIV/AIDS
treatment and care amounted to £199.6
million in 1997-98, and local authority
funding amounted to £13.7 million. In
Scotland £9.6 million has been made available
to health boards for HIV/AIDS treatment and
care in 1997-98. Details of Britain’s
contribution to international co-operation on
AIDS are given in chapter 9.
Voluntary Organisations
Voluntary agencies concerned with
HIV/AIDS include the Terrence Higgins
Trust, London Lighthouse, Body Positive and
the National AIDS Trust. Both London
Lighthouse and the Mildmay Mission
Hospital, in London, provide hospice care and
community support. The Government
distributes grants on a yearly basis, taking into
account developing health priorities and the
ability of voluntary bodies to raise funds from
other sources for HIV/AIDS work.
Infectious Diseases
Health authorities/health boards carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis, whooping
cough and haemophilus influenzae type B
infection (‘Hib’). Immunisation is voluntary,
but parents are encouraged to protect their
children. The proportion of children being
vaccinated has been increasing since 1978. GPs
who achieve targets of 70 and 90 per cent uptake
of child immunisation receive special payments.
By September 1996 immunisation uptake
in Britain was 96 per cent for diphtheria,
tetanus and polio, 95 per cent for Hib (a
major cause of meningitis in children under
five years), 94 per cent for whooping cough,
and 92 per cent for measles, mumps and
rubella for children by their second birthday.
The incidence of such childhood diseases is
at its lowest ever level. Since the introduction
of the Hib vaccine in 1992, Hib meningitis
has been almost completely eliminated in
young children.
Health authorities/boards have a key
responsibility for prevention and control of
outbreaks of infectious disease, liaising closely
with colleagues in environmental health
departments of local authorities. They are
assisted by the Public Health Laboratory
Service, which aims to protect the population
from infection through the detection,
diagnosis, surveillance, prevention and control
of communicable diseases in England and
Wales. Similar facilities are provided in
Scotland by the Scottish Centre for Infection
and Environmental Health and, in Northern
Ireland, by the Department of Health and
Social Services, the Northern Ireland Public
Health Laboratory and other hospital
microbiology laboratories.
In response to the worldwide resurgence of
TB (tuberculosis) in recent years, a working
group was set up in 1994 to consider policies
for TB control. The group issued two reports
in 1996: the first spelt out the essential
elements of a successful local control and
prevention policy; the second recommended
strategies for identifying, treating and
preventing TB in homeless people, a group at
particular risk.
Cancer Care
Care and treatment of cancer forms an
enormous part of the NHS’s work,
consuming nearly 7 per cent of its total
budget. A framework for the future
development of cancer services was
announced in 1995. This recommended that
services should be organised at three levels,
with primary care seen as the initial focus of
care; cancer units created in many local
hospitals of a sufficient size to support a
multidisciplinary team with the expertise and
facilities to treat commoner cancers; and
cancer centres situated in larger hospitals to
treat less common cancers and to support
smaller cancer units by providing services not
available in all local hospitals. Health
authorities/health boards are now planning to
implement the changes recommended.
The new Government is committed to
improving the provision and availability of
409
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
high-quality cancer services and is directing
savings achieved from cuts in the cost of the
NHS internal market (see p. 392) into patient
care. As a first step, £10 million has been
made available for breast cancer services to
speed up access to diagnosis, reduce waiting
times for treatment and support networks of
specialist breast cancer teams.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer is recognised as a major health
problem in Britain. In England and Wales
some 13,000 women die from it each year and
1 in 12 women in England (1 in 10 in
Scotland) will develop it. Britain was the first
country in the European Union to introduce a
nationwide breast screening programme,
under which women aged between 50 and 64
are invited for mammography (breast X-ray)
every three years by computerised call and
recall systems. In 1995-96:
• 76 per cent of women in England (74 per
cent in Scotland) aged 50 to 64 invited
for screening were screened;
• over one million women of all ages were
screened within the programme;
• 5,569 cases of cancer were diagnosed
among women screened in England (522
cases in Scotland).
The nationwide cervical screening
programme aims to reduce death from cancer
of the cervix by inviting women aged between
20 and 64 (20 and 60 in Scotland) to take a
free smear test at least every five years. Health
authorities must ensure that the results of a
smear test are returned from the laboratory to
the patient within a month.
Special payments are made to GPs who
achieve targets of 50 and 80 per cent for the
uptake of smear tests. The Government
estimates that almost all GPs now earn bonus
payments for meeting cervical screening targets.
In Scotland over 83 per cent of eligible women
have been screened over the last five years.
Deaths from cervical cancer in England
and Wales have fallen since the programme
began, dropping from 1,942 in 1988 to 1,369
in 1994, and in Scotland from 191 in 1988 to
138 in 1996.
Health Education
Responsibility for health education in Britain
lies with four separate health education
authorities, which work alongside the national
health departments. All four authorities are
part of the NHS. They are the Health
Education Authority; Health Promotion
Wales; The Health Education Board for
Scotland; and the Health Promotion Agency
for Northern Ireland. All have broadly similar
responsibilities. Their aims are:
• to provide information and advice about
health directly to members of the public;
• to support other organisations and health
professionals who provide health
education to members of the public; and !
• to advise the Government on health
education.
In addition, the Health Education
Authority has the major executive
responsibility for public education in Britain
about AIDS. It also assists in the provision of
training for HIV/AIDS workers, and provides
a national centre of information and advice on
health education. Major campaigns carried out
by the health education authorities include
those focusing on coronary heart disease,
cancer, smoking and alcohol misuse.
Almost all NHS health authorities/health
boards have their own health education service,
which works closely with health professionals,
health visitors, community groups, local
employers and others to determine the most
suitable local programmes. Increased resources
in the health service are being directed towards
health education and preventive measures.
GPs receive special payments for health
promotion programmes.
Healthier Eating
.
There has been growing public awareness in
recent years of the importance of a healthy
diet. Medical research has shown that a diet
which is low in fats, especially saturates, and
rich in fruits, vegetables and starchy foods !
contributes to good health and can reduce the
risk of certain serious illnesses, such as
coronary heart disease and stroke.
410
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
The Health of the Nation White Paper
followed the recommendations of the
Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food
and Nutrition Policy (COMA) that people
should reduce their average intakes of total fat
and saturated fatty acids and avoid obesity in
order to reduce cardiovascular disease. It
contained dietary targets for reducing these
two nutrients and for reducing adult obesity,
and the Nutrition Task Force was established
in 1992 to devise a programme to achieve
them. The programme was implemented
through a number of project teams in
information and education, catering, the NHS
and the food chain. The Task Force published
its final report in April 1996 and its
programme was devolved to the wider
community and to those considered best
placed to ensure progress towards the targets.
In July 1996 the Scottish Diet Action
Group published an action plan designed to
d deliver, over 10 years, the changes
recommended in a 1993 working party report
on the improvements required in the Scottish
diet. The plan highlights the steps that the
food industry and other interests can take
voluntarily to improve the Scottish diet. The
Food and Nutrition Strategy Group is
developing a plan for Northern Ireland.
Nutritional labelling indicating the energy,
fat, protein and carbohydrate content of food
is being encouraged on a voluntary basis. The
major supermarket chains and most food
manufacturers have already introduced
voluntary labelling schemes. Nutrition
labelling is compulsory on products for which
a nutritional claim is made. The food industry
is exploring ways of making the labelling
information easier to understand.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health provides public health
protection through control of: physical
environment; atmospheric pollution and noise;
contaminated land, food and water; unfit
housing; health and safety; communicable
diseases; and statutory nuisances. In Britain
no single government department is
responsible for environmental health as a
whole, although the Department of Health
advises other government departments on the
health implications of their policies. The role
of central government departments includes
the formulation of policy, drafting and
processing of legislation on environmental
health services, provision of guidance on the
legislation, and, in some areas, enforcement.
Environmental health services are mainly
operated at local level through regional and
district local government units.
Professionally trained environmental health
officers are mainly employed by local
authority councils. They are concerned with
inspection, health education and regulation.
The Institute for Environment and Health,
established by the Medical Research Council,
is concerned mainly with research and
management of research into the hazards to
which people may be exposed through the
environment. In Scotland the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health
provides surveillance and advisory services on
environmental health matters.
The Department of Health, Welsh Office
and Scottish Office have established the
national Focus for Work on response to
chemical incidents and surveillance of health
effects of environmental chemicals. Located in
Cardiff, the Focus is concerned with co¬
ordinating expert advice to health
professionals at the time of incidents, and
providing support to the NHS on emergency
planning, surveillance and training issues.
Safety of Food
Under the Food Safety Act 1990 it is illegal
to supply food that is unfit for human
consumption or falsely or misleadingly
labelled. Treatments or processes must not
make food harmful to health. Places where
food or drink is prepared, handled, stored or
sold must comply with hygiene provisions.
Local authorities enforce food law and
environmental health officers may take away
for examination, samples of food on sale for
human consumption. In addition to general
regulations laying down hygiene
requirements, there are specific regulations
for milk and milk products, meat and meat
products, eggs, fish products and shellfish,
covering labelling, composition, additives
and contaminants.
411
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
See chapter 18 for details of the
Government’s plans to set up an independent
Food Standards Agency.
CJD and Public Health
In 1996 the Government announced the
identification of a new variant of CJD
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), an extremely rare
spongiform encephalopathy in humans. The
government Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee (SEAC) concluded that
the most likely explanation, in the absence of
any credible alternative, is that these cases are
linked to exposure to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) before the introduction of the
ban on specified bovine offals in 1989.
While there remains no unequivocal
scientific evidence that CJD is linked to BSE,
the Government is providing additional
funding for research into CJD and BSE,
including for that carried out at the national
CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, which
monitors the incidence of the disease.
See chapter 18 for details of government
measures to control the spread of BSE.
SAFETY OF MEDICINES
Only medicines that have been granted a
marketing authorisation issued by the
European Medicines Evaluation Agency
(EMEA) or the Medicines Control Agency
(MCA) may be sold or supplied to the public.
Marketing authorisations are issued following
scientific assessment on the basis of safety,
quality and efficacy.
A number of committees provide
independent advice to the Medicines Control
Agency and the EMEA, for example the
Committee on Safety of Medicines in Britain.
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists in
the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for undergraduate
teaching; the NHS provides hospital and
community facilities for training. Full
registration as a doctor requires five or six
years’ training in a medical school and hospital,
and the community, with a further year’s
experience in a hospital. For a dentist, five
years’ training at a dental school is required.
An extensive review of specialist medical
training was carried out in 1992-93 and
its recommendations are now being
implemented. The Government considers that
the introduction of a new specialist registrar
grade, which reduces from three to two the
number of specialist training grades, will, in
future mean that doctors will increasingly
complete their training at an earlier age. The
changes, together with other policies to
increase consultant numbers and reduce junior
doctors’ hours, are expected to increase the
amount of service provided to NHS patients
by consultants.
The regulating body for the medical
profession is the General Medical Council
and, for dentists, the General Dental Council.
The main professional associations are the
British Medical Association and the British
Dental Association.
Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors
There are two routes to registration as a nurse
or midwife: either through a higher education
diploma or through a degree course.
Nursing students undertake the pre¬
registration Diploma in Higher Education
(Project 2000) programme, which emphasises
health promotion as well care of the sick and
enables students to work either in hospitals or
in the community. The programme lasts three
years and consists of periods of college study
combined with practical experience in hospital
and in the community.
Midwifery education programmes for
registered general/adult nurses take 18
months, but the direct entry programme lasts
three years.
Health visitors are registered general/adult
nurses who have completed a programme in
health visiting. By 1998 all programmes will
be at degree rather than at diploma level.
District nurses are registered general/adult
nurses who provide care for clients in the
community. As with health visitors, all
community nursing programmes will be at
412
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
degree rather than at diploma level from
October 1998. In Northern Ireland health
visitors, district nurses and schools nurses,
community psychiatric, community mental
handicap and occupational health nurses
undertake a one-year diploma course.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions. Four National Boards—for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland—are responsible for ensuring that the
education and training policies of the Council
are carried out. The main professional
associations are the Royal College of Nursing
and the Royal College of Midwives.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists.
Registration requires three or four years’
training in a school of pharmacy, followed by
one year’s practical experience in a
community or hospital pharmacy approved
for training by the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain or the
Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland
(regulatory bodies for the profession).
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight; training for the former takes four years,
including a year of practical experience under
supervision. Dispensing opticians take a two-
year full-time course with a year’s practical
experience, or follow a part-time day-release
course while employed with an optician.
Other Health Professions
Chiropodists, dieticians, medical laboratory
scientific officers, occupational therapists,
orthoptists, physiotherapists and radiographers,
and most recently, orthotists and prosthetists
may, after graduating, apply for state
registration. Each profession has its own board
under the general supervision of the Council
for Professions Supplementary to Medicine.
An application to create a further board for arts
therapists was approved in March 1997. State
registration is mandatory for employment in
the NHS and local authorities.
Dental therapists and dental hygienists are
almost exclusively recruited from certified
dental nurses who have taken at least one
year’s training. Dental therapists then take a
two-to-three-year training course and dental
hygienists take a two-year training course;
both carry out specified dental work under the
supervision of a registered dentist.
National and Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs and SVQs—see pp.
448-9) have been developed for health care
support workers, ambulance personnel,
operating department practitioners,
physiological measurement technicians and
administrative and clerical staff.
Complementary Medicine
Complementary medicine (or complementary
therapies) can cover a range of therapies and
practices, the best known being osteopathy,
chiropractic, homoeopathy, acupuncture and
herbalism.
Complementary medicine, with the
exception of homoeopathy, is usually available
only outside the NHS and is not commonly
included in private health insurance schemes.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European Economic
Area (EEA—see p. 126) have special health
arrangements under which EEA nationals
resident in a member state are entitled to
receive emergency treatment, either free or at
a reduced cost, during visits to other EEA
countries. Treatment is provided, in most
cases, on production of a valid Form El 11,
which in Britain, people should obtain from a
post office before travelling. There are also
arrangements for people who go to another
EEA country specifically for medical care, or
who require continuing treatment for a pre¬
existing condition. Unless covered by the
413
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
El 11 arrangements, visitors to Britain are
generally expected to pay for routine, non¬
emergency treatment, or if the purpose of
their visit is to seek specific medical treatment.
In addition to the EEA health arrangements,
Britain has a number of separate bilateral
agreements with certain other countries,
including Australia and New Zealand.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services help elderly people,
disabled people, children and young people,
people with mental illness or learning
disabilities, their families and carers. Major
services include skilled residential and day
care, help for people confined to their homes,
and the various forms of social work. The
statutory services are provided by local
government social services authorities in
England and Wales, social work departments
in Scotland, and health and social services
boards in Northern Ireland. Alongside these
providers are the many and varied
contributions made by independent private
and voluntary services. Much of the care given
to elderly and disabled people is provided by
families and self-help groups. Ther,e are an
estimated 7 million informal carers in Britain,
at least 1.5 million of whom provide over 20
hours of care a week. Carers who provide (or
intend to provide) substantial care on a regular
basis have the right, on request, to an
assessment of their own needs.
Demand for personal social services is
rising because of the increasing number of
elderly people, who, along with disabled and
mentally ill people, and those with learning
disabilities, have the opportunity to lead more
normal lives in the community, if they are
given suitable support and facilities.
In response to the piecemeal way
regulation in social services has developed, in
1995 the then Government launched a wide-
ranging review of the regulation and
inspection of children’s and adults’ personal
social services. The review issued its
report—the Burgner Report—in October
1996. It recommended that:
• local authority responsibility for
inspecting care homes should be removed
from the social services department and
placed elsewhere;
• local authority provision should be
subject to the same registration and
enforcement rules as voluntary and
private sector provision;
• regulation should be extended to include
small children’s homes and domiciliary
care; and
• all inspection reports should be available
to the public.
Management Reforms
Reforms in community care provision, which
came into force between 1991 and 1993,
established a new financial and managerial
framework intended to enable vulnerable groups
in the community to live as independently as
possible in their own homes for as long as they
are able and wish to do so, and to give them a
greater say in how they live and how the services
they need should be provided.
Local authorities increasingly act as
enablers and commissioners of services, as
well as the actual providers, after assessing
their populations’ needs for social care. They
are now responsible for funding and
arranging social care in the community for
people who require public support. This
includes the provision of home helps or home
care assistants to support people in their own
homes, and making arrangements for
residential and nursing home care for those
no longer able to remain in their own homes.
Local authorities’ community care
charters, first published in 1996, give local
people more information about the services
and standards they can expect under the
community care reforms.
Elderly People
Older people represent the fastest growing
section of the community. The proportion of
the population aged 75 and over has risen
from 4.7 per cent 25 years ago to 7.1 per cent
in 1996. The number of elderly people in the
population is expected to grow less quickly in
the next decade than it has in the previous
decade.
414
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
Services for elderly people are designed to
help them live at home whenever possible.
These services may include advice and help
given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in, night
attendants and laundry services as well as day
centres, lunch clubs and recreational facilities.
Adaptations to the home can overcome a
person’s difficulties in moving about, and a
wide range of equipment is available for people
with difficulties affecting their hearing or
eyesight. Alarm systems have been developed
to help elderly people obtain assistance in an
emergency. In some areas ‘good neighbour’ and
visiting services are arranged by the local
authority or a voluntary organisation. Elderly
people who live in residential care homes or
nursing homes are subject to charging with a
means test. Those who cannot afford to pay
have their costs met by the State. Local
authorities in England, Scotland and Wales
may also levy charges for domiciliary services.
The most marked trend in residential care
provision over recent years has been the
continuing increase in the number of places
provided in the private and voluntary sector
and the corresponding fall in the number
provided in local authorities’ own homes.
As part of their responsibility for social
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people (‘sheltered
accommodation’); some of these developments
have resident wardens. Housing associations
and private builders also build such
accommodation.
Many local authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for elderly people within
their areas.
Disabled People
Britain has an estimated 6 million adults with
one or more disabilities, of whom around
400,000 (7 per cent) live in communal
establishments. Over the past ten years there
has been increasing emphasis on rehabilitation
and on the provision of day, domiciliary and
respite support services to enable disabled
people to live independently in the
community wherever possible.
Local social services departments help with
social rehabilitation and adjustment to
disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and to
publicise services. These may include advice
on personal and social problems arising from
disability, as well as on occupational,
educational, social and recreational facilities,
either at day centres or elsewhere. Other
services provided may include adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs,
stairlifts and ground-floor toilets), the delivery
of cooked meals, and help with personal care
at home. In cases of greatest need, help may be
given with installing a telephone or a
television. Local authorities and voluntary
organisations may provide severely disabled
people with residential accommodation or
temporary facilities to allow their carers relief
from their duties. Special housing may be
available for those able to look after
themselves.
Some authorities provide free or subsidised
travel for disabled people on public transport,
and they are encouraged to provide special
means of access to public buildings.
The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is
designed to tackle discrimination against
disabled people in Britain by providing them
with a more accessible environment. The Act:
• provides a right for disabled people not
to be discriminated against in
employment and places a duty on
employers with 20 or more staff to
consider reasonable adjustments to the
terms on which they offer employment
where these would help to overcome the
practical effects of a disability;
• provides a right of access to goods and
services which will make it unlawful to
refuse to serve a disabled person and may
require service providers to make
reasonable adjustments to their services
to make them more accessible. The
provisions requiring ‘reasonable
adjustments’ have yet to be
implemented; and
• has established the National Disability
Council to advise the Government on
eliminating discrimination against
disabled people.
The new Government has transferred
responsibility for disability issues from the
415
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Department of Social Security to the
Department for Education and Employment.
This is intended to signal a move away from
treating disabled people merely as recipients
of benefits towards a culture which will value
their wide role in society as people willing and
able to take advantage of education, training
and employment opportunities.
People with Learning Disabilities
(Mental Handicap)
The Government’s policy is to encourage the
development of local services for people with
learning disabilities and their families through
co-operation between health authorities, local
authorities, education and training services,
and voluntary and other organisations.
Local authority social services departments
are the leading statutory agency for planning
and arranging services for people with
learning disabilities. They provide or arrange
short-term care, support for families in their
own homes, residential accommodation and
support for various types of activities outside
the home. The main aims are to ensure that as
far as possible people with learning disabilities
can lead full lives in their communities and are
admitted to hospital only when it is necessary
on health grounds. People with learning
disabilities form the largest group for local
authority-funded day centre places and the
second largest group in residential care.
The NHS provides for the primary health
care needs of people with learning disabilities
as it does for the general population. It also
provides specialist services when the ordinary
NHS services cannot meet health care needs.
Residential care is provided for those with
severe or profound disabilities whose needs
can only effectively be met by the NHS.
Mentally 111 People
Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental illnesses should have access to all
the services they need as locally as possible.
The cornerstone of community care policy for
mentally ill people is the Care Programme
Approach. Under this, each patient in contact
with the specialist services should receive an
assessment and a care plan, have a key worker
appointed to keep in touch with him or her,
and be given regular reviews. The Care
Programme Approach is subject to audit,
enabling health authorities to identify any
problems with the quality of its
implementation.
While the total number of places for mentally
ill people in the large hospitals has continued to
fall, this has been matched by increasing
provision of alternative places in smaller NHS
hospitals, local authority accommodation and
private and voluntary sector homes.
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care and
after care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social centres
and residential care. Social workers help
patients and their families with problems
caused by mental illness. In some cases they
can apply for a mentally disordered person to
be compulsorily admitted to and detained in
hospital. In England and Wales the Mental
Health Act Commission (in Scotland the
Mental Welfare Commission and in Northern
Ireland the Mental Health Commission)
provide important safeguards for patients to
ensure that the law is used appropriately.
A grant of £61.3 million for 1997—98 to
local authorities in England (£18 million in
Scotland) is designed to encourage them to
increase the level of social care available to
mentally ill patients, including those with
dementia who need specialist psychiatric care
in the community.
Supervision registers for discharged
patients most at risk are maintained by the
providers of services for mentally ill people
and allow hospital staff to keep track of them.
For details of the Government’s homeless
mentally ill initiative, see chapter 23.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with those suffering from mental
illness (such as MIND and SANE), or
learning disabilities (such as MENCAP), and
they play an important role in providing
services for both groups of people.
Help to Families
Local authorities must safeguard the welfare
of any child in need, and promote the
416
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
upbringing of such children by their families,
by providing a range and level of services
appropriate to those children’s needs. These
services can include advice, guidance,
counselling, help in the home, or family
centres and can be provided for the family of
the child in need or any member of the family,
if this will safeguard the child’s welfare. Local
authorities can provide these services directly
or arrange for them to be provided by, for
example, a voluntary organisation. Local
authorities are also required to publicise the
help available to families in need. Many local
authorities or specialist voluntary
organisations run refuges for women, often
with young children, whose home conditions
have become intolerable, through, for
example, domestic violence. The refuges
provide short-term accommodation and
support while attempts are made to relieve the
women’s problems.
Day Care for Children
Day care facilities for children under five are
provided by local authorities, voluntary agencies
and privately. In allocating places in their day
nurseries and other facilities, local authorities
give priority to children with special social,
learning or health needs. Local authorities also
register and inspect childminders, private day
nurseries and playgroups in their areas and
provide support and advice services.
Day care figures for England up to the end
of March 1996 show:
• 5,700 day nurseries with 178,000 places—
an increase of 6 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively over 1995.
• 103,000 registered childminders, providing
376,000 places—an increase of 6 per cent
and 1 per cent respectively over 1995.
• There was a small fall in playgroup
provision, with under 17,000 playgroups
providing just under 400,000 places—
equivalent to one place at a weekly session
for each child aged 2 to 4.
• There was a considerable increase in
facilities for younger school age children:
places at out of school clubs increased by
57 per cent (to 70,000) and those at holiday
schemes by 7 per cent (to 205,000).
The Government has begun work on a
comprehensive review of the provision of
education and care for children aged under five.
National Strategy for Childcare
In July 1997 the new Government announced
plans to develop an integrated childcare
system to match the requirements of the
modern labour market and help parents,
especially women, to balance family and
working life. See chapter 6, p. 44, for details of
out-of-school childcare facilities for children
over age 5.
Child Protection
Cases of child abuse are the joint concern of a
number of different agencies and professions.
Area child protection committees provide
forums for discussion and co-ordination and
draw up policies and procedures for handling
cases. The Government’s central initiative on
child abuse has provided funding for a variety of
projects, including training for health visitors,
school nurses, and local authority social services
staff. In Scotland the Government provides
support for child protection training at the
University of Dundee and through a grant
scheme for local authorities.
The number of children and young people
on child protection registers in England show
that by the end of March 1996:
• There were about 32,000 children on
registers, a decrease of 7 per cent
compared with 1995.
• About 28,000 names were added to the
register during the year, a decrease of 7
per cent since 1995; and about 30,000
names were removed from the register,
an increase of 1 per cent compared with
the previous year.
• About 40 per cent of registrations related
to those considered at risk of physical
injury. Those considered at risk of
neglect accounted for 33 per cent; those
considered at risk of sexual abuse, for 22
per cent. Boys accounted for 54 per cent
of those registered under ‘physical
injury’; girls accounted for 61 per cent of
those registered under ‘sexual abuse’.
417
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Children in Care
Local government authorities must provide
accommodation for children who have no
parent or guardian, who have been abandoned,
or whose parents are unable to provide for
them.
In England and Wales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if
he or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed to
moral danger, beyond the control of parents,
or not attending school. The court can commit
children to the care of a local authority under a
care order. Certain preconditions have to be
satisfied to justify an order. These are that the
children are suffering or are likely to suffer
significant harm because of a lack of
reasonable parental care or because they are
beyond parental control. However, an order is
made only if the court is also satisfied that this
will positively contribute to the children’s
well-being and be in their best interests. In
court proceedings children are entitled to
separate legal representation and the right to
have a guardian to protect their interests. All
courts have to treat the welfare of children as
the paramount consideration when reaching
any decision about their upbringing. The law
requires that wherever possible children
should remain at home with their families.
Parents of children in care retain their
parental responsibilities but act as far as
possible as partners with the authority. Local
authorities are required to prepare a child for
leaving their care and to continue to advise
him or her up to the age of 21; they are also
required to have a complaints procedure with
an independent element to cover children in
their care.
Recent concerns over standards of care in
certain local authority children’s homes
prompted a number of official inquiries
between 1992 and 1993; their
recommendations are now being
implemented.
In Scotland children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection
may be brought before a children’s hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker, but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment
while under supervision. Supervision
requirements are reviewed at least once a year
until ended by a children’s hearing.
In Northern Ireland the juvenile court
may place children who are in need of care,
protection or control into the care of a fit
person (including a health and social services
board or trust), or may make them subject to
a supervision order.
Fostering and Children’s Homes
Local authorities have a duty to ensure that
the welfare of children being looked after
away from home is properly safeguarded as
regards their health, education, contact with
their families and general quality of life.
Local authorities are required to produce a
plan for the future of each child in their care.
When appropriate, children in care are
placed with foster parents, who receive
payments to cover the child’s living costs.
Alternatively, the child may be placed in
residential care. Children’s homes are
provided for a range of purposes and may
also be registered as schools. They may be
run by local authorities, voluntary or private
organisations and are subject to formal
inspections.
Adoption
Local authority social services departments
are required by law to provide an adoption
service, either directly or by arrangement
with approved voluntary adoption societies.
Agencies may offer adoptive parents an
allowance in certain circumstances if this
would help to find a family for a child. Under
adoption law it is illegal to receive an
unrelated child for adoption through an
unapproved third party. The Registrars-
General keep confidential registers of
adopted children.
Adopted people may be given details of
their original birth record on reaching the age
of 18 (or 16 if adopted in Scotland), and
counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
enables adopted adults and their birth
parents to be given a safe and confidential
way of making contact if that is the wish of
both parties. A person’s details are entered
only if they wish to be contacted. In Scotland
a similar service is provided through
BirthLink.
The number of children, healthy babies in
particular, who are available for adoption is
far exceeded by those people wishing to
adopt. In recent years fewer than 7,000
children have been adopted annually. Of
those, about half are adopted by one legal
parent and a new partner, following marriage
or remarriage.
The Government intends to introduce
new adoption legislation as soon as
parliamentary time allows.
Finance
In 1994-95 nearly 50 per cent of local
authorities’ spending on personal social
services was on elderly people (see pie chart).
The biggest single item of expenditure was
residential care for older people, which
accounted for 25 per cent of all gross personal
social services spending.
During the same period the greater part of
local authorities’ spending on children’s
services involved the provision of community
homes, fostering and field social work.
Social Services Staff
The effective working of the social services
depends largely on professionally qualified
social workers. Training programmes leading
to a Diploma in Social Work (DipSW) are
provided by partnerships between universities
and colleges of higher and further education
and employing agencies. The Central Council
for Education and Training in Social Work
(CCETSW) is the statutory body responsible
for promoting and regulating social work
training. The range of qualifications available
include National Vocational Qualifications
(NVQs and, in Scotland, SVQs), the DipSW
and two further awards—the Post Qualifying
Award in Social Work and the Advanced
Award in Social Work. The range of
qualifications is relevant for staff working in
all sectors, including those in residential, day
and domiciliary care service.
Professional social workers (including those
in the NHS) are employed mainly by the
social services departments of local authorities
(local authority social work departments in
Scotland and Health and Social Services
Trusts in Northern Ireland). There is also a
growing independent sector.
Each of the four countries of Britain has a
personal social services training strategy whose
objectives include increasing the supply of
qualified social workers, and improving the
quality of both qualifying training and the
training of the existing workforce.

Social security is the Government’s largest expenditure programme. Planned
spending in 1997-98 is almost one-third of public expenditure (see p. 159). The
Government elected in May 1997 has stated its commitment to a far-reaching
overhaul of the social security system. This is based on the key objectives of
promoting incentives to work, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and
strengthening community and family life. Measures already being taken
include a wide-ranging review of pensions, a Bill at present before Parliament
to modernise the way in which social security is delivered, and the Welfare-to-
Work programme to help young people, the long-term unemployed and lone
mothers back into work.
As the largest single area of government
spending, social security amounts to about 30
per cent of all public expenditure, compared
with 13.5 per cent in 1949-50, the first full
year after the introduction of the Welfare
State (see p. x).
There are many reasons for this growth,
not least the increasing number and range of
benefits, as social security has expanded to
cover both a wider range of contingencies and
the changing shape and expectations of
society. The system of ‘safety net’ benefits is
now far more comprehensive than when the
Welfare State began. Medical advances have
increased life expectancy. Between 1951 and
1995 the proportion of the population over
pension age rose from around 13.5 per cent to
18.5 per cent. People who become disabled are
now leading long and active lives. Fifty years
ago, they might not have survived the onset of
their disability. These and other factors have
meant that both the numbers receiving
benefits and the amounts that they receive
have increased far beyond what was expected
when the Welfare State was conceived.
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need by providing income during
421
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from disablement.
There are four broad categories of social
security benefit:
• contributory benefits, where
entitlement depends on a satisfactory
record of payment of contributions to the
National Insurance Fund,1 from which
benefits are paid;
• income-related benefits, available to
people whose income falls below a certain
level, depending on their family
circumstances. These benefits take
account of capital, as well as income;
• Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 427),
which has both contributory and income-
related components; and
• other benefits, which depend on
qualifying conditions such as disability or
family needs.
Contributory benefits account for about
one half of programme expenditure; income-
related benefits for almost a third; and other
non-contributory benefits for about a sixth-
General taxation provides over half the
income for the social security programme,
with employers’ National Insurance
contributions around a quarter and employees’
National Insurance contributions about a fifth.
Appeals about claims for benefits are decided
by independent tribunals.
ADMINISTRATION
Administration in Great Britain is handled by
five separate executive agencies of the
Department of Social Security, together
employing a total of around 94,000 staff:
• the Benefits Agency administers and
delivers the majority of benefits;
• the Child Support Agency assesses and
collects maintenance payments for
children (see p. 428);
1 The National Insurance Fund is a statutory fund into which all
National Insurance contributions payable by employers,
employees and self-employed people are paid and from which
expenditure on contributory benefits is met.
• the Contributions Agency handles
National Insurance contributions;
• the Information Technology Services
Agency computerises the administration
of social security; and
• the War Pensions Agency delivers
services to war pensioners.
The Housing and Council Tax Benefit
schemes are administered by local authorities,
which recover most of the cost from the
Government.
In Northern Ireland, National Insurance
contributions and social security benefits are
administered by the Social Security Agency.
The Housing Benefit scheme is administered
by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
and the Rate Collection Agency; council tax
does not apply in Northern Ireland, where
domestic ‘rates’ are still collected.
Advice about Benefits
The Department of Social Security produces a
range of leaflets and posters providing general
information on entitlement and liability.
These are available in English and a number
of other languages. The Benefit Enquiry Line
is a confidential telephone service offering
general advice to people with disabilities and

Proposed Legislative Changes
The Social Security Bill at present before
Parliament is designed to modernise the way
social security is delivered. It aims to overhaul
complex legal arrangements that have grown
up piecemeal over the years and to create a
streamlined and integrated service.
Its provisions include, among others:
• creating a simpler process for deciding
claims and appeals for all social security
benefits, and increasing accountability for
the administration of the appeals process;
• introducing changes in the National
Insurance scheme to ensure that
employers, employees, and the self-
employed do not avoid payment;
• simplifying the award and review of Social
Fund budgeting loans (see p. 429); and
422
SOCIAL SECURITY
• simplifying administrative details by
ensuring that certain taxes on benefits
and expenses are dealt with in the same
way by the tax and National Insurance
systems.
Counter-fraud Measures
A range of measures is being introduced to
improve the prevention and detection of fraud
in the social security system:
• The Social Security Administration
(Fraud) Act, passed in March 1997,
includes powers to deal with landlord and
Housing Benefit fraud. The Act, among
other measures:
- creates a new offence of obtaining
benefit by false representation;
- permits certain government
departments to share information with
each other;
- allows local authorities to share
information with each other and with
government departments;
- permits local authorities to require
certain landlords to provide
information about their residential
properties;
- enables local authority investigators to
gain entry to business premises and to
examine business records;
- makes preparations to stop fraudulent
landlords and claimants getting benefit
re-directed from one property to
another;
- introduces financial penalties as an
alternative to prosecution for those
who defraud the system; and
- enables the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate
(see below) to inspect and report on
local authorities’ administration of
Housing Benefit and Council Fax
Benefit.
• The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate was
established in April 1997 to examine and
report on standards of counter-fraud and
security performance in the
administration of all social security
benefits.
• A government-funded pilot scheme was
launched in July 1997 to investigate
organised benefit fraud in London which
involves more than one local authority.
The scheme, which is concentrating on
fraud involving organised gangs,
landlords and managing agents, will run
until March 1999 when its success will be
evaluated.
• Phonelines have been established to
provide members of the public with a
means of reporting suspected benefit
fraud and avoidance of tax and
contributions payments.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as Retirement Pension, Incapacity
Benefit, contributory Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Maternity Allowance and Widow’s Benefit, is
dependent upon the payment of contributions.
There are five classes of contributions. The
rates given below are effective from April
1997 to April 1998:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. Employees with earnings
below £62 a week do not pay Class 1
contributions. Contributions on earnings
of £62 a week and over are at the rate of 2
per cent of the first £62 of total earnings
and 10 per cent of the balance, up to the
upper earnings limit of £465 a week.
Employers’ contributions are subject to the
same threshold. On earnings above the
threshold, contributions rise in stages from
3 per cent of total earnings up to a
maximum of 10 per cent when earnings are
£210 or more a week; there is no upper
earnings limit. The contribution is lower if
the employer operates a ‘contracted-out’
occupational pension scheme (see p. 426).
• Class 1A—paid by employers who
provide their employees with fuel and/or
a car for private use. A Class 1A
contribution is payable on the cash
equivalent of the benefit provided.
• Class 2—paid by self-employed people.
Class 2 contributions are at a flat rate of
£6.15 a week. The self-employed may
423
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
claim exemption from Class 2 contributions
if their profits are expected to be below
£3,480 for the 1997-98 tax year. Self-
employed people are not eligible for
unemployment and industrial injuries
benefits.
• Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Contributions are
at a flat rate of £6.05 a week.
• Class 4-—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower limit
(£7,010 a year), and up to a set upper
limit (£24,180 a year) in addition to their
Class 2 contribution. Class 4
contributions are payable at the rate of 6
per cent.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions but the employer continues to
be liable. Self-employed people over
pensionable age do not pay contributions.

BENEFITS
For most contributory benefits there are two
conditions. First, before benefit can be paid at
all, a certain number of contributions must
have been paid. Second, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless contributions have been
paid or credited to a specific level over a set
period. A reduced rate of benefit is payable
dependent on the level of contributions paid
or credited. For example, a great many of
those receiving retirement pensions and
widows benefits receive a percentage-based
rate of benefit. Benefits are increased annually
in line with percentage increases in retail
prices. The main benefits (payable weekly) are
summarised on pp.424-33. Rates given are
those effective from April 1997 until April
1998.
Retirement
A state Retirement Pension is a taxable
weekly benefit payable, if the contribution
conditions have been met, to women at the age 1
of 60 and men at the age of 65. The Sex
Discrimination Act 1986 protects employees
of both sexes in a particular occupation from
being required to retire at different ages. This, 3
however, has not affected the payment of the
state retirement pension at different ages for
men and women.
Legislation was introduced in 1995 to
equalise the state pension age for men and
women at 65. The change will be phased in
over ten years, starting from April 2010.
Women born before 6 April 1950 will not be
affected; their pension age will remain at 60.
The new pension age of 65 will apply to
women born on or after 6 April 1955. Pension
age for women born between these dates will
move up gradually from 60 to 65.
The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of £62.45 for a single
person and £99.80 for a married couple,
together with an additional earnings-related
pension (sometimes called ‘SERFS’—state
earnings-related pension). Pensioners may
have unlimited earnings without affecting
their pensions. Those who have put off their
retirement during the five years after state
pension age may earn extra pension.

'1 Figures are for beneficiaries at any one time.
h Figures refer to the number of pensions and in payment, and not to the number of recipients.
A non-contributory retirement pension of
£37.35 a week is payable to people aged 80 or
over who have lived in Britain for at least 10
years since reaching the age of 60, and who
have not qualified for a contributory pension.
People whose pensions do not give them
enough to live on may be entitled to Income
Support (see p. 427). Over 10.6 million people
in Great Britain received a basic state pension
in 1996.
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded for
people whose opportunities to work are
limited while they are looking after a child or a
sick or disabled person. Men and women may
receive the same basic pension, provided they
have paid full-rate National Insurance
contributions when working. From April 1999
the earnings-related pension scheme will be
based on a lifetime’s revalued earnings instead
of on the best 20 years. It will eventually be
calculated as 20 per cent rather than 25 per
cent of earnings, to be phased in over ten years
from 1999. The pensions of people retiring
this century will be unaffected.
As part of its plan to improve the income of
women in retirement, the new Government is
to introduce a Bill to enable the courts to
divide pension rights between divorcing
couples. The arrangements are expected to be
in force by 2000.
425
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their employees
from the state scheme for the additional
earnings-related pension and provide their
own occupational pension instead. Their
pension must be at least as good as the state
additional pension. Joining an employer’s
contracted-out scheme is voluntary:
employers are not free to contract out
employees from the earnings-related pension
scheme without the employees’ consent. The
State remains responsible for the basic
pension.
Occupational pension schemes have 9.2
million members. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
pensionable age, who are unable or who do
not want to transfer their pension rights, are
now offered some protection against inflation.
Workers leaving a scheme have the right to a
fair transfer value. The trustees or managers
of pension schemes have to provide full
information about their schemes.
Increasing numbers of pensioners receive
income from occupational pensions and
investment income. Around two-thirds of all
pensioners now receive an occupational
pension worth, on average, £80.80 a week,
while more than three-quarters have some
form of income from their investments,
receiving an average of £38.40 a week.
As an alternative to their employers’
scheme or the state additional earnings-
related pension scheme, people are entitled to
choose a personal pension available from a
bank, building society, insurance company or
other financial institution. In 1994-95, 5.6
million people contracted out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme and took out
personal pensions. Legislation passed in 1995
requires occupational schemes to provide
equal treatment between men and women and
to make personal pensions more flexible and
attractive to a broader age-range.
A Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints about maladministration of
pension schemes and adjudicates on disputes
of fact or law. A pensions registry helps people
trace lost benefits. A new regulatory authority
for occupational pensions came into force in
April 1997 (see chapter 16).
Pensions Review
In July 1997 the new Government announced
a wide-ranging review of pensions. It
considers that the failure over the last 20 years
to develop an adequate pensions strategy has
resulted in widening inequalities among
pensioners. Its long-term objective is to ensure
that everyone has the opportunity to build up
an adequate pension to guarantee security in
retirement.
The review will look at the central areas of
insecurity for elderly people including all
aspects of the basic pension and its value, and
second pensions including SERFS (see p.
424). The Government intends to retain the
basic state pension as the foundation of
pension provision and SERFS for those who
wish to remain in it. It will aim to achieve a
broad-based agreement for the long-term
future of pensions.
It has also said that it wants to support and
strengthen the framework for occupational
pensions. It will develop its proposals for
stakeholder pensions, offering secure, flexible
and value-for-money second pensions for
those who cannot join an employer’s
occupational pension scheme, whose pay is
low or intermittent, and for whom personal
pensions are usually unsuitable. Proposals will
also be developed for citizenship pensions for
carers who are unable to contribute to
pensions in their own right.
As part of the review, the Government has
commissioned a report on the state of pension
provision in Britain and likely future trends. It
is also setting up a working group to look at
how improvements can be made to raising
awareness of pension issues.
The Government intends to publish an
initial framework for change in the first part of
1998.
Unemployment
Welfare-to-Work Programme
See chapter 12 for details of the Government’s
Welfare-to-Work programme, which offers
opportunities to work for all people of working
age who have, in its opinion, been left to
depend on benefit for too long. This includes
426
SOCIAL SECURITY
oung people, the long-term unemployed,
one parents and people who are disabled or
m Incapacity Benefit who want training or
vork.
obseeker’s Allowance
obseeker’s Allowance (JSA) is a benefit for
icople needing financial support because of
inemployment. To get JSA, claimants must
)e actively looking for work, and be capable
)f, and available for, work. They must
lormally be aged at least 18 years and under
oension age; and have paid enough National
insurance contributions or have income and
iavings below a certain level. All claimants are
ilso required to have a valid Jobseeker’s
\greement, which sets out a plan of action to
seek work. Benefit is paid at rates determined
3y family circumstances on a basis similar to
Income Support (see below). JSA can be
either contribution-based or income-based.
• Contribution-based JSA: those who have
paid enough National Insurance
contributions are entitled to a personal
JSA for up to six months, regardless of
any savings or partner’s income.
• Income-based JSA: those on a low income
are entitled to an income-based JSA,
payable for as long as the jobseeker
requires support and continues to satisfy
the qualifying conditions. The amount a
claimant receives comprises an age-
related personal allowance, allowances for
dependent children, premium payments
for those with children or special needs,
and mortgage interest payments.
Back to Work Bonus
To enhance incentives to take up or keep part-
time work, and encourage people to move off
benefit and into employment, recipients of
JSA and people aged under 60 who receive
Income Support can benefit from a Back to
Work Bonus. People who have been
unemployed for three months or more and are
working part-time may keep the first £5 of
their earnings (£10 for couples, £15 for lone
parents, disabled people and some people in
special occupations) in any week in which they
work while receiving benefit. An amount
equal to half of any earnings above that level
counts towards the build-up of a bonus
amount. When the unemployed person moves
off benefit and into work, he or she will be
able to claim a tax-free lump sum of up to
£1,000. The part-time (up to 24 hours a week)
earnings of a partner can also contribute
towards building up a Back to Work Bonus,
which can be paid if the couple leave benefit as
a result of the partner moving into work.
The new Government is to evaluate the
effectiveness of the Back to Work Bonus in
contributing to its Welfare-to-Work objectives.
Income Support
Income Support is payable to certain people
aged 16 or over who are not required to be
available for work, and whose income is below
certain set levels. They include lone parents,
pensioners, carers and long-term sick and
disabled people. Income Support is made up
of: a personal allowance based on age and on
whether the claimant is single, a lone parent or
has a partner; age-related allowances for
dependent children and additional sums
known as premiums; and housing costs. From
this total amount other income, including
some other social security benefits, is
deducted.
The Income Support scheme sets a limit to
the amount of capital a person may have and
still remain entitled to claim it. People with
savings or capital worth more than £8,000 are
ineligible; savings between £3,000 and £8,000
will reduce the amount received. People living
permanently in residential care or a nursing
home with savings over £16,000 are ineligible;
and savings between £10,000 and £16,000 will
affect the amount received.
The new Government has stated that it is
concerned that up to one million pensioners
currently fail to claim the income support to
which they are entitled and is commissioning
research into the reasons for this.
Earnings Top-up
While Family Credit (see p. 429) helps people
with dependent children to be better off in
427
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
work, there has been no similar provision for
single people and couples without children. In
1996 a new benefit—Earnings Top-up—was
introduced on a pilot basis to test whether
topping up wages for workers without
dependent children helps them get jobs and
stay in work. The new benefit is being tested
at two different levels, with different rates for
couples and single people. It is available in
eight pilot areas and is the first social security
benefit to be introduced on a pilot basis. An
intensive research and evaluation programme
has already begun.
Families
Most pregnant working women receive
Statutory Maternity Pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18
weeks to any woman who has been working
for the same employer for 26 weeks and who
earns on average at least £62 a week. She will
receive 90 per cent of her average weekly
earnings for the first 6 weeks and a lower rate
of £55.70 a week for the remaining 12 weeks.
Women who are not eligible for Statutory
Maternity Pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, or have recently changed jobs
or given up their job, may qualify for a weekly
Maternity Allowance, which is payable for
up to 18 weeks. This amounts to £55.70 a
week for employees and £48.35 a week for the
self-employed and those not in work. All
pregnant employees have the right to take 14
weeks’ maternity leave.
A payment of £100 from the Social Fund
(see p. 429) may be made if the mother or her
partner receive Income Support, income-
related Jobseeker’s Allowance, Family Credit
or Disability Working Allowance. It is also
available if a woman adopts a baby.
The main social security benefit for
children is Child Benefit. This is a tax-free,
non-contributory payment of £11.05 a week
for the eldest qualifying child of a couple, and
£9.00 for each other child. A higher rate of
£17.05 is payable for the eldest qualifying
child of a person bringing up a child on their
own, whether they are the child’s parent or
not. Child Benefit is payable for children up to
the age of 16, and for those up to 19 who
continue in full-time non-advanced education.
It is generally not payable to people whose
entry to Britain is subject to immigration
control.
A person claiming Child Benefit for an
orphaned child they have taken into their
family may be entitled to Guardian’s
Allowance. This is a tax-free non¬
contributory benefit of £11.20 a week,
reduced to £9.90 a week if a higher rate of
Child Benefit is in payment. In certain
circumstances Guardian’s Allowance can be
paid when only one parent is dead.
At the end of 1996 Child Benefit was paid
for 12,790,000 children, an increase on the
previous year of 60,000.
Child Support Agency
An estimated 1 million lone parents in Britain
bring up 1.7 million children in households
without work. The Child Support Agency
(CSA), set up in 1993, has now virtually
replaced the court system for obtaining basic
child maintenance. The CSA is responsible
for assessing child maintenance and, where
requested by either parent, collecting and
enforcing child maintenance payments and fori
tracing absent parents.
If any person is living with and caring for a
child, and one, or both, of the child’s parents
are living elsewhere in Britain, he or she may
apply to have child support maintenance
assessed and collected by the CSA. If that
person or their present partner claims Income
Support, income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Family Credit or Disability
Working Allowance, they may be required to
apply for child support maintenance if asked
to do so by the CSA.
Assessments for child support maintenanct
are made using a formula which takes into
account each parent’s income and which
makes allowance for essential outgoings.
Legislation passed in 1995 introduced a
system of departures from the formula
assessment of child support to allow the
amount of maintenance payable to be varied ii
a small proportion of cases. A child
maintenance bonus worth up to £1,000 may
be payable to parents with care who have bee
in receipt of Income Support or income-base
SOCIAL SECURITY
Jobseeker’s Allowance and in receipt of child
maintenance when they leave benefit for
work.
In Northern Ireland the child support
maintenance scheme is operated by the
Northern Ireland Child Support Agency,
established at the same time as the CSA.
The Government intends to review all
aspects of the CSA to ensure that maintenance
is assessed and collected as quickly as possible.
Childcare Costs
At present families claiming Family Credit,
Disability Working Allowance, Housing
Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, and who
pay for childcare for children aged under 11,
can have up to £60 a week in formal childcare
costs offset against their earnings when their
benefit entitlement is worked out. In July
1997 the Government announced measures
designed to make it easier for lone parents
and breadwinners with disabled partners to
return to work: from April 1998 the disregard
for childcare costs will be increased from a
maximum of £60 to £100 a week, where
there are more than two or more children in
the family, and the maximum eligible age will
be increased from 11 to 12.
As part of its Welfare-to-Work
programme (see chapter 12), the Government
is implementing a national childcare strategy
that will help lone mothers to get out and
work instead of being dependent on benefits.
A pilot scheme was launched in eight areas in
July 1997 in which lone parents with children
of school age are being invited into jobcentres
to be given advice and information about
voluntary work, training and work. This will
be accompanied by measures to increase the
supply of, and help with, childcare-for
example, by providing a network of school
clubs throughout the country. A national
programme will be fully implemented in
1998. See chapter 6, p. 44 for details of the
Government’s plans for improving childcare.
Family Credit
Family Credit is a tax-free benefit payable to
low-income working families with children. It
is payable to couples or lone parents. At least
one parent must work for at least 16 hours a
week. The amount payable depends on a
family’s net weekly income; the number and
ages of the children in the family; the amount
of certain childcare charges paid, and the
number of hours worked.
A maximum amount of Family Credit
(consisting of an adult credit, plus a credit for
each child varying with age, and an extra
credit if one parent works for at least 30 hours
a week), is payable if the family’s net weekly
income is less than £77.15. If income is more
than £77.15, 70 p of every £1 of the excess is
deducted from the maximum payable.
Child Benefit, Child Benefit (Lone Parent)
and the first £15 of any maintenance in
payment are not counted as income. And
certain childcare charges of up to £60 a week
can be offset against earnings before
entitlement to Family Credit is calculated.
The capital limit for Income Support (see p.
427) also applies to Family Credit.
In 1994-95 the total amount of Family
Credit paid was £1,441 million; total amount
unclaimed was estimated at £270 million. The
number of people receiving Family Credit was
estimated at 602,000 and the average number
not claiming although entitled was estimated
to be 220,000.
Social Fund
The Social Fund helps people with expenses
which are difficult to pay for out of regular
income. It consists of regulated payments,
which are not cash-limited, and discretionary
payments, which are paid out of an annual
budget (£467.5 million in 1997-98).
The regulated payments are:
• maternity payment—£100 for each baby
born, adopted or subject to a parental
order. Payable to those on Income
Support, income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance, Family Credit or Disability
Working Allowance;
• funeral payment—includes up to £600
for funeral expenses, plus the reasonable
costs of all burial or cremation expenses.
Available to those on Income Support
and income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Family Credit, Housing Benefit, Council
429
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Tax Benefit or Disability Working
Allowance; and
• cold weather payment—£8,50 a week
towards additional heating costs during
sustained periods of very cold weather
between November and March. Payable
to those on Income Support or income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance, who have a
pensioner or disability premium, or who
have a child under 5 years old.
The discretionary payments are:
• community care grants to help, for
example, people resettle into the
community from care, or to remain in the
community, to ease exceptional pressure
on families and to meet certain travel
expenses. Available to those on Income
Support or income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance or due to receive it on
discharge from care;
• budgeting loans for important
intermittent expenses after 26 weeks on
Income Support or income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance; and
• crisis loans to help people in an
emergency or as a result of a disaster
where there is serious damage or serious
risk to health or safety. There is no
qualifying benefit for this loan.
Widows
Widows’ Payment. Widows under the age of
60—or those over 60 whose husbands were
not entitled to a state retirement pension when
they died—receive a tax-free single payment
of £1,000 following the death of their
husbands, provided that their husbands had
paid a minimum number of National
Insurance contributions. Women whose
husbands have died of an industrial injury or
prescribed disease may also qualify, regardless
of whether their husbands had paid National
Insurance contributions.
A widowed mother with at least one child
for whom she is getting Child Benefit receives
a Widowed Mother’s Allowance of £62.45 a
week, with a further £9.90 for a child for
whom the higher rate of Child Benefit is
payable, and £11.20 for each subsequent child.
Widow’s Pension. A taxable, weekly
benefit of £62.45 a week is payable to a widow
who is 55 years or over when her husband dies
or when her entitlement to Widow ed Mother’s
Allowance ends. A percentage of the full rate is
payable to widows who are aged between 45 and
54 when their husbands die or when their
entitlement to Widowed Mother’s Allowance
ends. Special rules apply for widows whose
husbands died before 11 April 1988.
Entitlement continues until the widow
remarries or begins drawing retirement pension.
Payment ends if she lives with a man as his wife.
Widows also benefit under the Industrial
Injuries scheme (see p. 431).
A man whose wife dies when both are over
pension age inherits his wife’s pension rights
just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
Sickness and Disablement
A variety of benefits are available for people
unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying Statutory Sick Pay to employees
from the fourth day of sickness for up to a
maximum of 28 weeks. There is a single rate of
Statutory Sick Pay for all qualifying employees
provided their average weekly earnings are at
least equivalent to the lower earnings limit for
the payment of National Insurance
contributions. The weekly rate is £55.70.
Incapacity Benefit is for people below
state pension age who cannot work because of
an illness or disability. Entitlement to
Incapacity Benefit begins when entitlement to
Statutory Sick Pay ends or, for those who do
not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, from the
first day of sickness. The benefit has three
rates:
• a lower rate of £47.10 a week for the first
28 weeks (for those not entitled to
statutory sick pay);
• a higher rate of £55.70 a week between
the 29th and 52nd week; and
• a long-term rate of £62.45 a week from
the 53rd week of incapacity.
Extra benefits may be paid for adult and
child dependants. Incapacity Benefit is taxable
from the 29th week of incapacity.
SOCIAL SECURITY
The medical test of incapacity for work
usually applies after 28 weeks’ sickness. It
assesses ability to perform a range of work-
related activities rather than the ability to
perform a specific job.
Severe Disablement Allowance is a tax-
free benefit for people who have not been able
to work for at least 28 weeks because of illness
or disability but who cannot get Incapacity
Benefit because they have not paid enough
National Insurance contributions. The benefit
is £37.75, plus additions of up to £13.15 a
week depending on the person’s age when
they became incapable of work. Additions for
adult dependants and for children may also be
paid. Claims may be made by people aged
between 16 and 65. Once a person has
qualified for the allowance, there is no upper
limit for receipt. New claimants must satisfy
the same incapacity test as that used in
Incapacity Benefit (see above).
People who become incapable of work after
their 20th birthday must also be medically
assessed as at least 80 per cent disabled for a
minimum of 28 weeks. People already in
receipt of certain benefits, such as the higher
rate of the Disability Living Allowance care
component, will automatically be accepted as
80 per cent disabled.
Other Benefits
Disability Living Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit for adults aged
under 65 years and children with an illness or
disability who need help with personal care
and/or with getting around. It has two
components: a care component which has
three weekly rates—£49.50, £33.10 and
£13.15; and a mobility component which has
two weekly rates—£34.60 and £13.15, payable
from age 5 and over.
Attendance Allowance, a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit of £49.50 or
£33.10 a week, may be payable to people
severely disabled at or after age 65, who have
personal care needs, depending upon the
amount of attention they require.
A non-contributory Invalid Care
Allowance of £37.35 weekly may be payable
to people between 16 and 65 who cannot take
up a full-time paid job because they are caring
for at least 35 hours a week for a person
receiving either Attendance Allowance or the
higher or middle care component of Disability
Living Allowance. An additional carer’s
premium may be paid if the recipient is also
receiving Income Support, income-related
Jobseeker’s Allowance, Housing Benefit or
Council Tax Benefit. About 1.5 million adults
in Great Britain care for a disabled person for
at least 20 hours a week.
Disability Working Allowance is a tax-
free, income-related benefit for people aged 16
or over who work an average of 16 hours a
week or more and have an illness or disability
that limits their earning capacity. Awards are
for fixed periods of six months. To qualify a
person must either:
• be getting Disability Living Allowance,
or an analogous benefit, such as Constant
Attendance Allowance under the War
Pensions or Industrial Injuries
Disablement scheme; or
• have an invalid three-wheel vehicle
supplied by the Department of Social
Security; or
• have been entitled to one of the following
in at least one of the 56 days before the
date of claim: higher rate short-term
Incapacity Benefit; long-term Incapacity
Benefit; Severe Disablement Allowance;
or the disability premium or higher
pensioner premium with Income Support,
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit.
The allowance is available to single people,
lone parents and couples. The rate depends on
the person’s income and size of family, and the
ages of any children. The allowance is not
payable if capital or savings exceed £16,000.
Motability, an independent charitable
organisation, helps disabled drivers to obtain
vehicles or powered wheelchairs on favourable
terms by using the higher rate mobility
component of Disability Living Allowance or
the War Pension mobility supplement.
Industrial Injuries Disablement
Benefits/Reduced Earnings Allowance
Various benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
431
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
disease caused by a particular type of
employment. The main benefit is the tax-free
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit:
up to £101.10 a week is usually paid after a
qualifying period of 15 weeks if a person is at
least 14 per cent or more physically or
mentally disabled as a result of an industrial
accident or a prescribed disease.
Basic Disablement Benefit can be paid in
addition to other National Insurance benefits,
such as Incapacity Benefit. It can be paid
whether or not the person returns to work and
does not depend on earnings. The degree of
disablement is assessed by an independent
adjudicating medical authority and the
amount paid depends on the extent of the
disablement and on how long it is expected to
last. Except for certain progressive respiratory
diseases, disablement of less than 14 per cent
does not attract Disablement Benefit. In
certain circumstances additional allowances,
such as Constant Attendance Allowance
and Exceptionally Severe Disablement
Allowance, may be payable. In some cases
Reduced Earnings Allowance may be
payable.
Housing and Council
Tax Benefits
Housing Benefit is an income-related, tax-
free benefit which helps people on low incomes
meet the cost of rented accommodation, using
general assessment rules and benefit levels
similar to those for Income Support (see p.
427). It can pay up to 100 per cent of rent,
depending on the claimant’s circumstances.
Unlike Income Support, the Housing Benefit
scheme sets a limit of £16,000 on the amount of
capital a person may have and still remain
entitled to claim benefit.
Housing Benefit for most private sector
tenants is calculated by reference to the
general level of rents for properties with the
same number of rooms in the locality. This is
designed to ensure that private sector tenants
receiving benefit have an incentive to choose
better value accommodation at the outset of a
tenancy.
Most single people aged under 25 who are
not lone parents and who are renting privately
have their Housing Benefit limited to the
average cost of non-self-contained
accommodation in the locality; this is intended
to reduce disincentives to work, and to
discourage young people from leaving home
before they can afford to do so.
In 1996-97 a total of £11,523 million of
Housing Benefit was paid. An average 4.7
million people claimed.
Council Tax Benefit helps people to
meet their council tax payments (the tax set by
local councils to help pay for services—see
chapter 11, p. 167). The scheme offers help to
those claiming Income Support and income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance and others with
low incomes. Subject to rules broadly similar
to those governing the provision of Income
Support and Housing Benefit (see above),
people may receive rebates of up to 100 per
cent of their council tax. In 1996-97, 5.6
million households received such help. A
person who is solely liable for the council tax
may also claim benefit (called ‘second adult
rebate’) for a second adult who is not liable to
pay the council tax and who is living in the
home on a non-commercial basis.
In 1996-97 the total amount of Council
Tax Benefit paid was £2,361 million. An
average 5.6 million people claimed.
War Pensions and
Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement as a
result of service in the armed forces or for
certain injuries received in the merchant navy
or civil defence during wartime, or to civilians
injured by enemy action. The amount paid
depends on the degree of disablement: the
pension for 100 per cent disablement is
£107.20 a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for care and
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£7.15 and £22.10 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and
other dependants. (The standard rate of

pension for a private’s widow is £81.00 a
week.) War Widow’s Pension is also payable to
a former war widow who has remarried and
then become widowed again, divorced or
legally separated.
The War Pensioners’ Welfare Service helps
and advises war pensioners, war widows and
other dependants. It works closely with ex-
Service organisations and other voluntary
bodies which give financial help and personal
support to those disabled or bereaved as a
result of war.
Concessions
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service charges
(see p. 398), grants towards the cost of
spectacles, free school meals and free legal aid
(see p. 112). In families which are on Income
Support, pregnant women and children under
5 years old are entitled to free milk and
vitamins.
People on low incomes, as well as all
pensioners, widows and long-term sick people
on Incapacity Benefit, receive extra help to meet
the cost of VAT on their fuel bills. In 1997-98
the cost of this help will be about £750 million.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners are
usually entitled to reduced transport fares.
Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which replace
lost earnings are subject to tax, while those
intended to meet a specific need are not (see
Table 25.2). Various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or a
need to support dependants.

Allowance, Housing Benefit or Council Tax

Asylum Seekers
Only people who claim refugee status as soon as
they arrive in Britain can claim income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support,
Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.
Their eligibility to receive this will stop if their
asylum claim is refused by the Home Office.
People who claim asylum after they have
arrived in Britain are not entitled to benefit.
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour,
Further Reading
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include Child
Benefit and those for sickness and maternity,
unemployment, retirement, invalidity,
accidents at work and occupational diseases.
Britain has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries
which also provide cover for some National
Insurance benefits and family benefits.
In 1996, 759,400 British National
Insurance pensions were paid overseas, at a
cost of some £950 million.

Education and Training after 16 448
It was in the late 1970s that serious concern began to be expressed about the
quality of school education and the lack of a national curriculum. Since then
major changes have taken place, including the introduction of various forms
of school curriculum, the testing and assessment of pupils’ progress and the
provision of much more information about school performance to parents.
Education is the top priority of the new Government. Its policy is being
focused on improvements in school standards and creating partnerships
between the local education service, the schools inspectorates and central
government.
INTRODUCTION
Despite the reforms which have taken place to
date, test results have shown that many pupils
still leave school with few or no qualifications
and that standards of literacy have not
changed significantly since 1945. In order to
deal with this problem, a programme of
legislation for England and Wales has been
drawn up to improve school standards for
pupils in their first years of education. This is
designed to ensure education for all 4 year olds
whose parents want it, effective assessment of
all those starting primary school and more
time devoted to literacy and numeracy in
primary schools. Training for teachers on best
practice in teaching these subjects will be
provided. In addition, it is government policy
to reduce class sizes over the next five years to
fewer than 30 for all 5, 6 and 7 year olds. A
new Standards and Effectiveness Unit has
been established to spread best practice
throughout the education service in England.
Administration
Four government departments, each headed
by a Secretary of State, are responsible for
education. These are the Department for
Education and Employment in England, the
Scottish Office Education and Industry
Department, the Welsh Office Education
Department and the Department of Education
for Northern Ireland.
In England, Scotland and Wales most state
school education is provided by local
government education authorities and the rest
by self-governing and grant-maintained schools.
However, there are only two self-governing
state schools in Scotland. In Northern Ireland
five education and library boards own, manage
and run all controlled schools; they also fund
most voluntary schools (see p. 438) and provide
finance for advisory and support services for all
schools in their areas.
The education service in Great Britain is
financed in the same way as other local
435
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
government services (see chapter 7, p. 84),
education authorities providing funds to
schools largely on the basis of pupil numbers.
In Northern Ireland the costs of the education
and library boards are met by the Department
of Education. There are, however, some further
resources allocated to education authorities in
England and Wales for specific purposes, such
as training to improve school performance in
literacy and numeracy, support for information
technology and funds for inner city schools
facing particularly severe problems. Additional
government grants are made for capital
expenditure at voluntary aided schools (see
p. 437).
Grant-maintained schools in England are
financed by the Funding Agency for Schools,
which distributes central government grants to
them. Similar schools in Wales are financed by
the Welsh Office.
SCHOOLS
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive full-time education, at school
or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16 in
England, Scotland and Wales and 4 and 16 in
Northern Ireland. About 93 per cent of pupils
receive free education from public funds,
while the others attend independent schools
financed by fees paid by parents.
Nursery Schools
Over half of 3 and 4 year olds attend nursery
schools, nursery classes or reception classes in
primary schools. In addition, many children
attend pre-school playgroups, most of which
are organised by parents.
The new Government aims to secure high-
quality nursery education for 4 year olds
whose parents want it. Proposals have been
published under which English and Welsh
local education authorities (LEAs), in
partnership with private and voluntary
providers, will draw up early years
development plans, setting out how this aim
will be achieved. The plans are designed to
show how co-operation between private
nurseries, playgroups and schools can best
serve the interests of children and their
parents by dovetailing education with top-
quality childcare. In addition the Government
will work with local authorities and others to
establish early excellence centres designed to
demonstrate good practice in education and
childcare.
In Scotland a new system of planning and
funding for nursery education will be
introduced from August 1998; this is intended
to support the Government’s objective of
providing a part-time place for every pre¬
school age child whose parents want it.
The previous Government’s nursery
voucher scheme for providing nursery places,
which was launched in 1996, is being
abolished.
Primary Schools
Compulsory education starts in infant primary
schools or departments; at the age of 7 many
pupils transfer to separate junior primary
schools or departments. The usual age for
transfer from primary to secondary school is
11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
and 12 in Scotland. Some LEAs in England
have first schools for pupils aged 5 to 8, 9 or

10 and middle schools for age ranges between
8 and 14.
It is government policy to reduce the size of
primary school classes for 5, 6 and 7 year olds
to 30 or below within the next five years.
LEAs are being invited to begin drawing up
action plans to ensure that this target is met.
Secondary Schools
The majority of state secondary pupils in
England and Wales attend comprehensive
schools. These mostly take pupils without
reference to ability or aptitude, providing a
wide range of secondary education for all or
most of the children in a district. Schools
include those taking the 11 to 18 age-range,
middle schools, and schools with an age range
of 11 or 12 to 16. Most other state-educated
children attend grammar or secondary modern
schools, to which they are allocated after
selection procedures at the age of 11.
Scottish secondary education is non-
selective, consisting of comprehensive schools
covering the age-range 12 to 18.
In Northern Ireland secondary education is
organised largely along selective lines, with
grammar schools admitting pupils on the basis
of tests in English, maths and science. Most
pupils attend non-grammar secondary schools.
City Technology Colleges
There are 15 city technology colleges in
England and Wales, which are non-fee-paying
secondary independent schools created by a
partnership of government and private sector
sponsors. The promoters own or lease the
schools, employ teachers and other staff, and
make substantial contributions to the costs of
building and equipment. The National
Curriculum (see p. 439) is taught with an
emphasis on maths, technology and science.
Specialist Schools
The specialist schools programme in England
was launched in 1993 with the creation of
technology colleges. These are state secondary
schools which teach the National Curriculum
(see p. 439) with a special emphasis on
technology, science and maths. A network of
language colleges concentrates on teaching
modern foreign languages while continuing to
deliver the full National Curriculum.
Specialist arts and sports colleges, too, have
been opened.
A specialist school must have the backing of
private sector sponsors if it wishes to become
specialised. Capital and annual grants are
available from public funds to complement
business sponsorship. There are 194
technology colleges, 47 language colleges, 6
arts and 11 sports colleges in England.
School Management
England and Wales
At present there are four main types of state
school:
• county schools owned and funded by
LEAs;
• voluntary schools (of which there are
three categories), established by church
and other foundations and funded mainly
by LEAs;
• grant-maintained (GM) schools funded
by central government; and
• special schools (LEA and grant-
maintained) for pupils with special
educational needs.
The Government intends to establish a new
framework for school organisation. There will
be five categories of state school—community,
foundation, voluntary, community special and
foundation special. All state schools will work
in partnership with and receive their recurrent
funding from LEAs. The LEA’s job will be to
support and challenge schools to raise
educational standards, not to control them.
Schools will be run by governing bodies, as
they are now. The number of parent
governors will be increased. Other governors
will represent the local community, school
staff and the LEA. The governing bodies of
church schools will also include church
representatives.
Schools will manage their own budgets and
staffing, as they do now. The new framework
for local management of schools will be based
437
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
on a clear distinction between functions that
LEAs must carry out and fund centrally and
those for which schools are responsible, using
their delegated budgets.
Scotland
In Scotland over 75 per cent of schools have
school boards consisting of elected parent and
staff members as well as co-opted members.
They are required to promote contact between
parents, the school and the community, and
are involved in the appointment of senior staff
and the community use of school premises.
Devolved management (from the education
authority to the school) is in place in primary,
secondary and special schools.
Northern Ireland
The main categories of school supported by
public funds are:
• controlled schools, which are owned by
the education and library boards and
wholly financed from public funds;
• voluntary maintained schools, most of
which are owned by the Roman Catholic
Church; the majority of these schools are
wholly financed from public funds;
• voluntary grammar schools, which may
be owned by denominational or non-
denominational bodies and, with the
exception of a small capital fee in some
schools, are wholly financed from public
funds; and
• grant-maintained or controlled integrated
schools, which take Protestant and
Roman Catholic pupils and are wholly
financed from public funds.
All publicly financed schools are managed
by boards of governors, which include elected
parents and teachers among their members.
Although all schools must be open to pupils
of all religions and there is some crossover
between schools, most Roman Catholic pupils
attend Catholic maintained schools or Catholic
voluntary grammar schools, and most
Protestant children are enrolled at controlled
schools or non-denominational voluntary
grammar schools.
The Government has a statutory duty to
encourage integrated education as a way of
breaking down sectarian barriers. There are 32
integrated schools with some 7,000 pupils
(about 2 per cent of the school population).
Integrated schools are financed by the
Government. Existing controlled, maintained
and voluntary grammar schools can apply to
become integrated following a majority vote
by parents.
Virtually all schools have delegated budgets
under which school governors decide
spending priorities.
Rights and Duties of Parents
Parents must be given general information
about a school through a prospectus and the
school’s annual report or, in Scotland, the
school’s handbook. They also have a statutory
right to express a preference for a particular
school for their child, and there is an appeal
system if their choice is not met.
In England and Wales parents choosing a
local secondary school have the right to see:
• national performance tables showing the
latest public examination results,
vocational qualification results and rates of
absence on a school-by-school basis; and
• information in each local school’s
prospectus on its public examination
results, vocational qualification results,
attendance rates and the destinations of
school leavers.
All state schools in England and Wales have
to give parents a written annual report on their
child’s achievements, containing details about:
• the child’s progress in all subjects and
activities;
• the child’s attendance record;
• the results of National Curriculum
assessments and of public examinations
taken by the child;
• comparative results of pupils of the same
age in the school and nationally; and
• the arrangements for discussing pupils’
school reports with teachers.
Under new proposals, these school
performance tables will be made more useful
438
EDUCATION
by showing the rate of progress made by
pupils as well as their absolute levels of
achievement.
All parents are invited to an annual meeting
to discuss the governors’ annual report.
Under new proposals, parents in England
and Wales will become more involved with
their child’s education through a written
home-school agreement setting out clearly
what is expected of the school, parents and
pupils. All schools will be required to have
such agreements. The Government is also
planning to increase the number of elected
parent governors and to ensure that at least
one elected parent governor will serve on LEA
policy-making education committees. In
addition, home-school associations of parents
and teachers will be encouraged in England,
and will be a requirement in Wales.
The Government has stated that homework
for pupils is an essential part of a good
education and the school’s approach to this
may form part of the home-school agreement.
Following consultation, national guidelines
will be issued giving details about the amount
of homework pupils are expected to do.
In Scotland information is published for
parents on school costs, examination results,
pupil attendance and absence, and the
destinations of school leavers. Inspection
reports are published for parents. National
guidelines to schools on reporting to parents
advise that they should provide them with
information about their children’s attainment
in the various subjects, teachers’ comments on
their progress and details about steps to build
on success or overcome difficulties. One main
school report each year is advised, together
with one brief update report.
The Northern Ireland system for reporting
to parents is broadly similar to that in England
and Wales.
School Curriculum
England and Wales
The National Curriculum consists of statutory
subjects for 5 to 16 year olds. English, maths
and science are core subjects for 5 to 11 year
olds in England; other statutory subjects are
design and technology, information
technology, geography, history, physical
education, arts and music. A modern foreign
language is added for pupils aged between 11
and 14. Statutory subjects at ages 14 to 16 are
English, maths, science, technology, a foreign
language and physical education. Religious
education and, at secondary level, sex
education are not prescribed in the curriculum
but are requirements (see p. 440). Careers
education is also statutory at secondary level.
There is a separate curriculum for Wales
reflecting not only the Welsh language but the
different circumstances of Wales. Nearly all
primary schools in Wales teach Welsh as a
first or second language and about a quarter
use Welsh as the sole or main medium of
instruction. In secondary schools, Welsh is
compulsory for pupils aged 11 to 16 in Welsh¬
speaking schools and for pupils aged 11 to 14
in other schools. English is not a statutory
language in Welsh-speaking schools catering
for pupils aged 5 to 7. The Government is
proposing to extend opportunities to be
educated through the medium of Welsh.
The Government has announced targets to
improve literacy and numeracy for 11 year
olds in England in order to provide them with
a more satisfactory preparation for secondary
education. By 2002, the targets are for 80 per
cent of 11 year olds to reach the standards for
their age in English and 75 per cent in maths.
In addition, all primary schools will, from
1998, be expected to devote an hour to English
during each teaching day. Local literacy
consultants will train teachers in all the
primary schools in their area, and the project
will be managed by the Government’s
Standards and Effectiveness Unit. The
Government has established a Numeracy Task
Force to advise on a new programme for
maths teaching, including a daily numeracy
hour for primary school pupils from 1998.
Targets set out for Wales are different from
those in England. The Government is
consulting on targets for English, Welsh and
maths. The schools inspectorate will publish
advice to teachers on how to manage time in
order to give due weight to literacy and
numeracy. Other measures are being explored
to raise standards in these subjects.
For each National Curriculum subject,
programmes of study lay down what pupils
439
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
should be taught, with attainment targets
setting out expected standards of performance.
Pupils’ performance is assessed at the ages of 7,
11 and 14 by their teachers in the core subjects
of English, maths and science. Fourteen year
olds are also assessed in National Curriculum
statutory non-core subjects. In addition, 7 year
olds take National Curriculum tests in English
and maths, and most 11 and 14 year olds are
tested in the core subjects. In Welsh-speaking
schools the three age-groups are tested in
Welsh.
The Government is proposing to introduce
a scheme under which effective assessment
will be made of the abilities of all children
starting primary school.
All state schools must provide religious
education, each LEA being responsible for
producing a locally agreed syllabus which has
to be reviewed every five years. Syllabuses
must reflect Christianity while taking account
of the other main religions practised in
Britain. Parents have the right to withdraw
their children from religious education classes.
All state secondary schools are required to
provide sex education for all pupils, including
education about HIV/AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases. In primary
schools the governors decide whether sex
education should be offered beyond the
requirements of the National Curriculum
Science Order. Parents are entitled to
withdraw their children from sex education
classes other than those required by the
National Curriculum. All state schools must
provide information to parents about the
content of their sex education courses.
The General Certificate of Secondary
Education (GCSE) is the main qualification
taken by pupils at the end of compulsory
schooling at the age of 16. There are also
GCSE (Short Course) qualifications taking
half the time allotted to a GCSE; these are
available in modern foreign languages,
physical education, religious education,
geography, history, design and technology,
and information technology. In Wales a Short
Course GCSE is available in Welsh as a
second language.
The Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority (QCA) is an independent
government agency, which brings together the
work of the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications and the School Curriculum and
Assessment Authority, with additional powers
and duties, giving it an overview of the
curriculum, assessment and qualifications
across the whole of education and training in
England. The QCA is responsible for ensuring
that the curriculum and qualifications
available to young people and adults are of
high quality, coherent and flexible. There is a
similar organisation in Wales called the
Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment
Authority for Wales.
All GCSE and other qualifications offered
to pupils in state schools must be approved by
the Government. Associated syllabuses and
assessment procedures must comply with
national guidelines and be approved by the
relevant qualifications authority.
Scotland
Content and management of the curriculum
are not prescribed by statute, responsibility
resting with education authorities and
headteachers. Guidance is available from the
Secretary of State and the Scottish
Consultative Council on the Curriculum,
which has recommended that secondary
school pupils should have a broad and
balanced curriculum.
A major review programme has been
carried out on the curriculum for 5 to 14 year
olds. Government guidance has been issued
on English, maths, expressive arts, Latin,
Gaelic, modern languages, environmental
studies, and religious and moral education.
Standardised tests in English and maths are
given to pupils whenever they complete one of
five levels. A major programme to extend
modern language teaching to primary schools
is in progress.
Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in
Gaelic-speaking areas and in some other areas
where education authorities have identified
this as a priority. More resources are being put
into Gaelic teaching.
Scottish education authorities are required
to ensure that pupils are given religious
instruction although parents can withdraw
their children if they wish. Some schools
provide for Roman Catholic children, but in
440
EDUCATION
all schools there are safeguards for individual
conscience.
Government guidance on sex education is
provided to education authorities and
headteachers, who are responsible for the
content of the curriculum.
Pupils take the Scottish Certificate of
Education (SCE) at Standard Grade after four
years of secondary education at the age of 16.
The proportion of pupils leaving school with
no SCE qualification has fallen from one in
four in 1983-84 to fewer than one in ten. SCE
Standard Grade examinations are conducted
by the Scottish Qualifications Authority.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland curriculum,
compulsory in all publicly financed schools,
consists of religious education and six broad
areas of study: English, maths, science and
technology, the environment and society,
creative and expressive studies and, in
secondary schools, language studies. A core
syllabus for religious education has been
approved by the four main churches and this
must be taught in all grant-aided schools.
The curriculum also includes four cross¬
curricular themes: cultural heritage, education
for mutual understanding, health education
and information technology. Secondary
schools have two additional themes, namely,
economic awareness and careers education.
Sex education is taught through the
compulsory science programme of study and
the health education cross-curricular theme.
Following reviews of the curriculum, its
overall content has been reduced in primary
schools and more flexibility in subject choice
has been given to secondary schools. Teaching
of the compulsory curriculum takes up about
85 per cent of teaching time in primary schools
and 60 to 65 per cent in secondary schools.
Pupil assessment, which is statutory, takes
place at the ages of 8 and 11 for English and
maths; if a pupil is taught in the Irish
language, he or she is assessed in Irish and
maths at the age of 8 and in English, Irish and
maths at the age of 11. Fourteen year olds are
additionally assessed in science. As in England
and Wales, the GCSE exam is used to assess
16 year old pupils.
Information Technology
Curricular requirements in all parts of Britain
place a strong emphasis on the use of
information and communications technology
(ICT). The Government is proposing to create
a new National Grid for Learning for the
Millennium throughout Britain in order to
unlock the potential of computers and
communication networks for school education
and to equip pupils and other learners for this
new world. Its objective is to create a society
where, within ten years, information and
communication technology (ICT) has
permeated every aspect of education. Hitherto,
education has been affected relatively
marginally by these new technologies, although
recent publicly funded programmes have
considerably increased the installation and use
of micro-computers in schools.
The proposed Grid will provide curriculum
support for schools and help train teachers. It
will also link closely with the proposed
University for Industry (see p. 454). In
addition, national and local museums, galleries
and libraries will be an essential part of the
Grid which, using the Internet, will open up
learning to individuals by taking it beyond
school classrooms or lecture halls.
In addition, the Government is proposing
to:
• ensure that all new teachers are ICT-
literate and retrain all existing teachers
with funds from the National Lottery
(see chapter 6, pp. 47-8);
• .work with the cable and
telecommunications companies to
connect schools, colleges and libraries
and to keep access charges as low as
possible;
• develop plans for a public/private
partnership to deliver educational
software and services to teachers, pupils
and other learners; and
• ensure equality of access for all, including
people in isolated rural areas, those with
special educational needs and those in
areas of urban deprivation.
The four government education
departments jointly fund the National Council
for Educational Technology which promotes
441
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and evaluates the use of new technologies in
education and training. The Scottish Council
for Educational Technology also develops
software and other applications geared to the
curriculum and school organisation in
Scotland.
The British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC—see chapter 29) transmits television
and radio programmes for schools. The
independent Channel 4 (see chapter 29) also
broadcasts educational television programmes.
Teachers’ notes, pupils’ pamphlets and
computer software accompany many of these
broadcasts.
Raising School Standards
England and Wales
The newly created Standards and Effectiveness
Unit within the Department for Education and
Employment has been set up to ensure that all
parts of the education service in England
contribute fully to the raising of standards in
schools. It is staffed by civil servants and
practitioners from schools, local authorities and
other areas of education. The Welsh Office
Education Department fulfils this function in
Wales.
The principles underlying the
Government’s school improvement strategy
are that:
• the prime responsibility for improvement
lies with the schools themselves;
• the role of central government, supported
by national agencies and local
government, is to provide the right
balance of support for, and pressure on,
schools; and
• intervention in a school should be in
inverse proportion to its success.
In England the independent Office for
Standards in Education (OFSTED) and in
Wales the Office of Her Majesty’s Chief
Inspector advise the Government on quality,
standards and efficiency. The two
inspectorates also organise and regulate a
system of school inspections. Each school is
regularly inspected by a team of independent
inspectors containing educationalists and lay
people. Parents are sent a summary of the
report, which is also published in full. The
school governing body must prepare an action
plan to follow it up and report back to parents
on progress.
From 1998-99 each school will have its
own targets to raise standards and will be
responsible for achieving them. Each school
will be inspected every six years, but more
often where weaknesses are apparent. Between
inspections, school performance will be
regularly monitored by LEAs, which will
ensure that the school’s improvement plans
meet national guidelines set out by the
Government. Consultation on changes to the
system in Wales is taking place.
Each LEA will be working to a
development plan agreed with its schools and
approved by the Government. OFSTED and
its Welsh counterpart will inspect the
operations of LEAs to ensure that they are
driving up educational standards.
The Government is taking steps to ensure
the rapid improvement of schools where
standards are a cause for concern. The LEA
will be able to issue formal warnings and, if
necessary, appoint additional governors and
withdraw the school’s delegated budget.
Where a school found failing by inspectors
does not make adequate progress, central
government can either put the school under
new management or require the LEA to close
it, or make a fresh start by opening a
reconstituted school.
Education Action Zones
The Government is planning a pilot
programme of up to 25 education action zones
to be set up in areas with a mix of
underperforming schools and the highest
levels of disadvantage. The zones will
comprise groups of schools working together
with local partners and agencies with the aim
of improving standards in education. Zones
will be areas of innovation, both in ways of
working and in the provision of education. A
forum would be responsible for running each
zone and ensuring that ambitious targets for
improvement are met. The forum could
include representatives of parents, the
business and social community, schools and
the LEA. In addition, the Secretary of State
442
EDUCATION
would appoint one or two representatives to
provide advice and support. The Government
intends that in most circumstances at least one
school in the zone would be a specialist
technology, language, sports or arts college
which would become a magnet for excellence
in the area.
Scotland
In Scotland HM Inspectors of Schools (HMI)
are responsible for independent evaluation of
education standards and for advising the
Secretary of State. Reports are published on
inspections and given to parents. Inspectors
return to the school between one and two
years after the publication of the report to
assess progress in meeting their
recommendations. Their conclusions about
progress are published together with an
indication of any further action which may be
required. The school continues to be
monitored by HMI until the
recommendations have been satisfactorily
addressed.
HMPs Audit Unit collects, analyses and
publishes evidence about the performance of
schools and education authorities, and
recommendations are made for action and
improvement. It also publishes information
for parents about schools.
An action group has been appointed to
advise the Government on steps necessary to
raise standards, including the setting by
schools of targets for their own improvement.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Education and
Training Inspectorate evaluates, reports and
advises the Department of Education on
quality and standards in schools. Inspection
reports are published and a summary prepared
for parents. Where an inspection has
identified important weaknesses, school
governors are required to prepare an action
plan and submit details to the Department. In
such cases, a follow-up inspection will take
place about a year after the original inspection
and, if sufficient improvement has not been
made, a report will be published. The
governors will be required to submit a further
action plan and the school’s work will
continue to be monitored and evaluated by the
Inspectorate and the Department in order to
ensure that improvement takes place.
The Department is planning additional
measures to improve schools, based on a
recent three-year programme of evaluation
and support which was targeted on the 29
lowest achieving secondary schools and some
of their contributory primary schools.
Ethnic Minority Children
Children from ethnic minority backgrounds
form a tenth of the school population in
England and smaller proportions in Wales and
Scotland. While the achievements of some
groups are exceptional, others are
underperforming and efforts are being made
to improve matters.
English language teaching continues to
receive priority for pupils without English as
their first language. Schools may also teach the
main ethnic minority community languages at
secondary level in England and Wales as part
of the National Curriculum. Schools should
take account of the ethnic and cultural
backgrounds of pupils, and curricula should
reflect ethnic and cultural diversity. The
annual school census in England contains
questions about the ethnic backgrounds of
pupils.
The new Government is committed to
taking action to:
• spread successful teaching methods of
schools that have raised ethnic minority
pupils’ achievements;
• provide guidance on tackling racial
harassment and stereotyping; and
• review the level and delivery of specialist
support designed to raise the
participation and achievement of ethnic
minority pupils.
Children with Special Needs
Special educational needs comprise learning
difficulties of all kinds, including mental and
physical disabilities which hinder or prevent
learning. LEAs in England and Wales must
443
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
identify children whose learning difficulties
are very severe or complex, assess and meet
their needs, and involve parents in decisions
about their child’s education.
If the LEA believes that it should
determine the education for the child, it must
draw up a formal statement of the child’s
special educational needs and the action it
intends to take to meet them. There are
statutory time limits governing this procedure.
A state school named in the statement is
required to admit the child. The Government
has stated that over time more resources
should be put into direct support for children
and less emphasis placed on bureaucratic
statementing procedures.
In England and Wales parents have a right
of appeal to the Special Educational Needs
Tribunal if they disagree with the LEA
decisions about their child. The Tribunal’s
verdict is final and binding on all parties. The
Government has stated that it would like to
see more mediation between parents and
LEAs to reduce the need for disputes to be
taken to the Tribunal.
Wherever possible, children with special
educational needs are taught in ordinary
schools, where placement must be compatible
both with the needs of the child and the
provision of efficient education for the other
children in the school. The LEA is required to
comply with parents’ choice of school unless
this is inappropriate for the child, involves an
inefficient use of resources or is incompatible
with the efficient education of other children.
A Government Code of Practice offers
practical guidance to all LEAs and state
schools in England and Wales on how to
identify, assess and monitor all pupils with
special educational needs, Each school in
England and Wales must provide information
to parents about its policies on meeting special
educational needs.
The Government has established a
National Advisory Group to oversee the
implementation of programmes designed to
improve education for children with special
needs. It includes members from schools,
LEAs, voluntary bodies representing children
and parents, and others.
In Scotland the choice of school is a matter
for agreement between education authorities
and parents. Education authorities are
required to take special educational needs fully
into account when making provision for pupils
in their areas. There are a small number of
pupils (about 2 per cent of the school
population) whose needs are such that the
authority is required to open a record
describing the special education necessary to
meet them. A 1995 report by school inspectors
sets out basic principles emphasising the
importance of partnership between all
involved. The Government has increased
resources for in-service training of staff.
In Northern Ireland legislation has been
passed under which similar arrangements to
those in England and Wales, including an
appeal system, are being introduced.
There are some 1,570 special schools (both
day and boarding) in Britain for pupils with
special educational needs. Some of these are
run by voluntary organisations and some are
established in hospitals. They cater for some
115,700 pupils.
Health and Welfare of Schoolchildren
Physical education, including organised
games, is part of the curriculum of all state
schools. In England and Wales playing fields
must be available for pupils over the age of 8.
Government health departments are
responsible for the medical inspection of
schoolchildren and for advice on, and treatment
of, medical and dental problems. The education
service seeks to help prevent and deal with
juvenile drug misuse and to help prevent the
spread of AIDS. In England government funds
support the training of teachers with
responsibility for anti-drug education.
The Government has also issued guidance
on drug prevention in England’s schools,
outlining how to teach pupils about the
dangers of drug misuse, advising schools on
drug education and prevention, and giving
advice on how to deal with drug-related
incidents on school premises.
In Scotland similar curriculum advice is
made available to every school. School drug
education programmes are subject to
monitoring by school inspectors.
In Northern Ireland a drug education,
advice and resource pack has been issued to all
444
EDUCATION
schools and colleges. All schools must have a
drug education policy and publish details
about it in their prospectus.
Schools are responsible for providing
school meals for pupils, taking account of local
circumstances. The Government is proposing
to specify minimum nutritional standards for
inclusion in school meals contracts.
Free meals are provided for children whose
parents receive a social security benefit called
income support or another known as income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 427); all
other pupils are charged for meals. LEAs and
GM schools may provide milk to pupils.
Where they choose to do so they must provide
it free to pupils of parents in receipt of these
social security benefits. Milk to all other
pupils must be charged for.
In Northern Ireland school meals must be
provided for primary, special and grant-aided
nursery school pupils.
LEAs provide free of charge the transport
they consider necessary to enable pupils to
attend school and they may help other pupils
with their fares. LEAs must publish annually
details about their policy on free and assisted
transport.
Independent Schools
Fee-paying independent schools providing full¬
time education for five or more pupils of
compulsory school age must register by law with
the Department for Education and Employment
and are subject to inspection. They can be
required to remedy serious shortcomings in their
premises, accommodation, teaching or staffing
and, in the case of boarding schools, welfare of
pupils. They must exclude anyone who has been
barred from teaching in, or owning, a school.
About 7 per cent of schoolchildren attend
independent schools.
There are about 2,420 independent schools
in Britain educating 600,000 pupils of all ages.
They charge fees varying from around £300 a
term for day pupils at nursery age to over
£4,000 a term for senior boarding pupils.
Many offer bursaries to help pupils from less
well-off families as well as academic, music,
art and other scholarships. The Assisted
Places Scheme under which financial
assistance is given from public funds
according to parental income is being phased
out in order to channel the money saved into
cutting class sizes for all 5, 6 and 7 year olds in
state schools to 30 or below within the next
five years. The Government gives income-
related help with fees to pupils at eight music
and ballet schools; there are a limited number
of similar scholarships at cathedral choir
schools.
Independent schools range from small
kindergartens to large day and boarding
schools, and from new and, in some cases,
experimental schools to ancient foundations.
The 600 boys’, girls’ and mixed preparatory
schools prepare children for entry to senior
schools. The normal age-range for these
preparatory schools is from 7+to 11, 12 or 13,
but many have pre-preparatory departments
for younger children. A number of
independent schools have been established by
religious orders and ethnic minorities.
Independent schools for older pupils from 11,
12 or 13 to 18 or 19 include about 550 which
are often referred to as ‘public schools’.
In Northern Ireland there are only 21 small
independent schools, educating about 1,000
pupils. They are subject to inspection by the
Department of Education for Northern
Ireland.
The Government is to start consultations
on ways of bridging the gap between
independent and state schools. In particular it
is suggesting that independent schools, as an
expression of their charitable status, could
offer opportunities for more children by
sharing their facilities with the local
community. Many existing examples of this
co-operation include afternoon homework
classes and holiday arts, sports and language
courses.
Teachers
England and Wales
Teachers in state schools in England and
Wales are appointed by LEAs or school
governing bodies. They must hold
qualifications approved by the Government.
Almost all entrants to teaching in state
schools in England and Wales complete an
approved course of teacher training. These
445
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
courses are offered by university departments
of education as well as other higher education
establishments (see p. 451) and groups of
schools. One of the two main qualifications is
the three- or four-year Bachelor of Education
(BEd) honours degree. The other is the
successful completion of a three- or four-year
degree course, topped up by a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)
course.
Schools play an important role in initial
teacher training by helping to plan and
manage courses and select, train and assess
students, usually in partnership with colleges
and universities. Schools are able to train
students to teach their specialist subjects,
assess pupils and manage classes. Consortia of
schools can run courses for postgraduate
students if they wish to do so. Other courses,
including all undergraduate courses, are run
by universities and colleges in partnership
with schools.
The Teacher Training Agency (TTA) is
responsible for accrediting training providers
and for financing initial teacher training courses
in England. It also ensures that national
standards are met and promotes teaching as a
career. In Wales, initial teacher training is
funded by the Higher Education Funding
Council for Wales, which also accredits
institutions and schools providing courses.
The TTA has launched a national
qualification for headteachers, and the
Government expects this to form the basis of a
new mandatory qualification for future
appointees as heads. In addition the TTA has
developed its HEADLAMP programme in
England, which provides leadership and
management training for heads appointed to
their first posts. The Welsh Office has
recently consulted on plans to increase
headteacher training in Wales.
The Government has published details of a
new core curriculum in English and maths,
setting out the knowledge, understanding and
skills which all those training to teach these
subjects in primary schools must meet. In
Wales, Welsh will be included in this new
curriculum. More rigorous requirements have
also been announced for all primary and
secondary courses of initial teacher training
and will apply from 1998. In addition, the
Government is to introduce an induction year
for newly qualified teachers to consolidate
their skills. There are also plans to pilot the
development of laboratory schools in which
trainees will observe good and experienced
teachers at work.
In order to help experienced teachers to
stay in the profession, the Government
intends to introduce a new career grade of
Advanced Skills Teacher to reward the best
teachers willing to help raise standards by
supporting trainee and newly qualified
teachers in the classroom.
The Government is undertaking an urgent
review of existing arrangements for appraising
teachers’ performance. It has stated that key
elements in such arrangements should be
classroom observation, assessment of results
achieved by pupils in a teacher’s care and an
annual performance review linked to targets
for improved pupil performance.
LEAs, teacher trade unions and school
governor organisations have been asked to
work with the Government at national level in
order to solve the problem of the small
minority of incompetent teachers.
The Government has stated that it wants
teachers’ professional standing to be enhanced
by the creation of a General Teaching Council
which would speak for the profession and also
reflect the interests of parents, employers,
LEAs and the wider community. This
Council would ensure that teaching is a
profession based on high standards and would
raise the status of teaching and promote it as a
career. The Government intends to set up the
Council by 2000.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools
must be registered with the General Teaching
Council (GTC) for Scotland. The GTC is
responsible for disciplinary procedures under
which teachers guilty of professional
misconduct may be removed temporarily or
permanently from the register. Advice is given
by the GTC to the Secretary of State on
teacher supply and the professional suitability
of teacher training courses.
All entrants to the teaching profession are
graduates. New primary teachers qualify
446
EDUCATION
either through a four-year BEd course or a
one-year postgraduate course at a higher
education teacher training institution.
Teachers of academic subjects at secondary
schools must hold a degree with at least two
passes in each subject that they wish to teach.
Secondary school teachers must undertake a
one-year postgraduate training course or an
undergraduate course combining subject
studies, study of education and school
experience.
Guidelines for initial teacher training
courses stress the importance of partnership
between teacher training institutions and
schools, and the competences required in the
classroom for teachers beginning their careers.
All pre-service courses must be approved
by The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department. They must also be
validated by a higher education institution and
accredited by the GTC as leading to
registration. National guidelines for staff
development and appraisal are being reviewed.
Newly qualified teachers must serve a two-
year probationary period at the beginning of
their teaching careers.
Northern Ireland
All new entrants to teaching in grant-aided
schools are graduates and hold an approved
teaching qualification. Arrangements are being
developed under which initial teacher training
would be integrated with induction/early in-
service training, the latter covering a period of
three years. In addition, work is under way on
a recognised qualification for headteachers,
equivalent to the arrangements in England and
Wales. The Government is committed to the
establishment of a General Teaching Council
in Northern Ireland.
Teacher training is provided by Queen’s
University, in Belfast, the University of
Ulster, two colleges of education and the
Open University (see p. 453). The principal
courses are BEd Honours (four years) and the
one-year Postgraduate Certificate of
Education. The Open University course is
part-time and lasts 18 months. Education and
library boards have a statutory duty to provide
curricular support services and in-service
training.
Schools, Careers and Business
The Government has stated that improved
school-business links can help raise pupils’
levels of achievement and enable them to see
the relevance of what they learn at school. It is
therefore strengthening existing links such as
the Education Business Partnerships and wants
to see the best of EBP practice spread
throughout the country. The Partnerships
consist of representatives from industry,
education and the wider community, and aim
to bring about closer links between education
and industry in order to ensure that young
people develop the skills to help them succeed
in the labour market.
One of the main schemes managed by the
Partnerships is the Teacher Placement Service
(TPS), funded by the Government. The TPS
organises placements in business for teachers
and lecturers to extend their professional and
personal development, improve learning
opportunities for young people, and provide
better careers education services.
Compacts bring together employers, young
people, schools, colleges and other bodies
involved in training in order to help young
people achieve more at school, and to continue
their education and training after the age of
16. Under Compact schemes, young people
work towards agreed goals, while employers
provide incentives for achieving them.
The Government’s Project Business scheme
offers young people the opportunity to learn
how business works and acquire the work
skills needed by employers. Business
volunteers work with teachers and business/
works visits are arranged for young people.
Careers
All young people in full-time education are
entitled to impartial careers guidance. Most
secondary schools have a written policy
. statement on careers education and guidance,
a careers co-ordinator and an agreement with
their local careers guidance service about the
co-ordinated contribution they will make to
student development. LEAs are active
participants in the majority of careers service
organisations.
In Northern Ireland careers education is
one of the six compulsory education themes
447
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
forming part of the secondary school
curriculum (see p. 441). The Careers Service
is part of the Training and Employment
Agency.
All state secondary schools in England and
Wales provide leavers with a National Record
of Achievement setting out their school
attainments, including public examination and
National Curriculum assessment results. In
Scotland the Record is not compulsory.
In Northern Ireland all pupils in secondary
education are issued with a Record of
Achievement on leaving school, and from
1997-98 this applies to primary schools as
well,
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AFTER 16
The Government plans to ensure that all
young people will have access to high-quality
education and training after the age of 16.
Under the new Investing in Young People
programme, young people will have two
routes that they can follow—one based on
school and college education, and the other on
work-based learning. In addition, under the
Welfare-to-Work programme (see p. 173), all
young unemployed people will be guaranteed
education and training opportunities, while
those with poor basic skills will have the
option of participating in full-time study on an
approved course.
About 70 per cent of 16 year old pupils
choose to continue in full-time education in
school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges,
further education colleges, universities and
other higher education institutions. The
percentage for 17 and 18 year olds is 59 per
cent and 40 per cent respectively.
Broadly speaking, education after 16
outside schools is divided into further and
higher education. Further education is largely
vocational and in England covers courses up to
and including GCE A level and AS
qualifications, and GNVQ^Advanced level or
their equivalents (see below). Higher
education covers advanced courses at levels
higher than GCE A level or equivalent.
Youth credits are on offer from Training
and Enterprise Councils in England and
Wales and from Local Enterprise Companies
in Scotland (see p. 195).These enable 16 and
17 year olds leaving full-time education to
obtain vocational education and training
through their employer or a specialist trainer.
In many English and most Welsh post¬
school establishments, parts of each course
attract credits which can be accumulated by
the student and transferred between
institutions. In Scotland a credit accumulation
scheme covers courses in all further and
higher education. Similar schemes in higher
education in Northern Ireland are compatible
with those of institutions in the rest of Britain.
The national computer-based Educational
Counselling and Credit Transfer Information
Service (ECCTIS) provides prospective
students and their advisers with free access to
information on course opportunities at
universities and colleges throughout Britain.
ECCTIS can be found in the majority of
secondary schools with sixth forms, as well as
most further education colleges, universities,
careers offices, Training and Enterprise
Councils, and, in other countries, British
Council offices.
Schools and Sixth-form Colleges
Having completed compulsory school
education, students in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland can stay on at school, be
educated in a further education or sixth-form
college, or choose to take paid employment. If
they continue in education, they study for
examinations which lead to higher education,
professional training or vocational
qualifications. These include the academic
General Certificate of Education (GGE)
Advanced (A) level, the Advanced
Supplementary (AS) examination, General
National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs)
and National Vocational Qualifications
(NVQs). The GCE A level is usually taken at
the age of 18 or 19 after two years’ study; part
of the qualification is based on course work
and the rest on written test papers. AS levels
usually involve one year’s study and enable
sixth-form pupils to study a wider range of
subjects. A level arts students, for example,
can still study science subjects at AS level.
The new GNVQs, mainly undertaken by
young people in full-time education between
448
EDUCATION
the ages of 16 and 18, provide a broad-based
preparation for a range of occupations and
higher education. There are three GNVQ^
levels—Advanced, Intermediate and
Foundation. An Advanced GNVQ_requires a
level of achievement broadly equal to two
GCE A levels. GNVQs may also be taken in
combination with other qualifications, such as
GCE A levels or GCSEs.
GNVQs are awarded by the City and
Guilds of London Institute, the RSA (Royal
Society of Arts) Examinations Board and
Edexcel (formerly the Business and
Technology Education Council).
Skills valued by employers are being given
a higher priority in education and training.
More young people will also be offered the
opportunity to gain a qualification in the three
key skills of communication, application of
number and information/communication
technology, which are already compulsory in
GNVQs and some publicly funded youth
training schemes.
The Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority is responsible for supervising
academic and vocational qualifications in
England as well as the school curriculum (see
p. 440). A similar organisation has been
established in Wales (see p. 440).
Scotland
Pupils staying on at school after the end of
compulsory education study for the Higher
Grade Scottish Certificate of Education
examination (‘Highers’) between the ages of
16 and 18; passes at this grade are the basis for
entry to higher education or professional
training. The Certificate of Sixth Year Studies
(CSYS) is for pupils who have completed
their Higher Grade main studies and who
wish to continue studies in particular subjects.
A flexible system of vocational courses for
16 to 18 year olds has been introduced in
schools and colleges in subjects such as business
and administration, engineering and industrial
production. These courses are also intended to
meet the needs of many adults entering training
or returning to education. The courses lead to
the award of the non-advanced National
Certificate for students over 16 who have
successfully completed a programme of
vocational courses based on short study units.
Similar unit-based courses are also available at
advanced levels, leading to the award of a
Higher National Certificate or Diploma.
General Scottish Vocational Qualifications
(General SVQs) are designed to meet the
needs of 16 to 19 year olds at school or in
further education colleges. Broadly compatible
with the GNVQs in the rest of Britain,
General SVQs are a stepping-stone to higher
education or further training. They are
accredited and awarded by the Scottish
Qualifications Authority.
A new five-level system of courses and
awards for fifth- and sixth-year pupils—
‘Higher Still’—will be introduced in August
1999. Under this, Highers remain as one of
the levels, but courses are based on units of
study of 40 or 80 hours. The recommended
study time for each Higher is extended from
120 hours to 160 hours. Advanced Higher
courses are being developed, incorporating the
current Certificate of Sixth Year Studies and
building on Highers to provide a two-year
320-hour course. Group awards will be
available at all five levels. The Scottish
Qualifications Authority validates and awards
course certificates.
Further Education Colleges
People over the age of 16 can also take courses
in further education colleges, where much of
the study is work-related. Further education
institutions supply much of the education in
government-sponsored training programmes.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Many students on further education
courses attend part-time, either by day release
or block release from employment or during
the evenings. The system has strong ties with
commerce and industry, and co-operation
with business is encouraged by the
Government and its agencies. Employers are
normally involved in designing courses.
Courses are run by some 550 institutions of
further education, many of which also offer
higher education courses (see p. 451). In
England and Wales each is controlled by an
autonomous corporation and governing body
with substantial representation from business.
Public funding is allocated to institutions by
further education funding councils, part of it
being directly related to student numbers.
The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department distributes funds to
colleges in Scotland which are controlled by
autonomous boards of management.
In Northern Ireland further education
colleges are financed through the education
and library boards by the Department of
Education; in April 1998 the colleges will
become free-standing institutions financed
directly by the Department.
Funding councils in England and Wales
send out independent inspectors to assess the
quality of the education provided by colleges.
They publish reports containing quality
assessments, and colleges are obliged to
explain how they will put things right if there
are major criticisms. Each college has to
publish information about its examination
results annually. Colleges in Scotland are
inspected by the Schools Inspectorate and in
Northern Ireland by the Education and
Training Inspectorate.
Vocational Qualifications
England, Wales and Northern Ireland have a
wide range of National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs), awards which
recognise work-related skills and knowledge
and provide a path for lifelong learning and
achievement. Prepared by industry and
commerce, including representatives from
trade unions and professional bodies, NVQs
are based on national standards of competence
and can be achieved at levels 1 to 5. Level 1
awards cover routine tasks carried out under
supervision, while Level 5 NVQs encompass
complex work roles, often involving detailed
technical knowledge and a high level of
responsibility.
In Scotland there is an analogous system of
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs).
NVQs and SVQs have mutual recognition
throughout Britain.
Awarding Bodies
NVQs are offered by awarding bodies
approved by the appropriate qualifications and
assessment authority. The awarding bodies are
approved to offer a qualification for a set
period of time, after which they must seek
reaccreditation from the authority to offer that
particular award. This ensures that the
standards of competence on which awards are
based are kept up to date and relevant.
In Scotland the Scottish Qualifications
Authority is the national accreditation body
and the main awarding organisation.
National Targets for Education
and Training
The National Targets for Education and
Training, originally launched in 1991 and
revised in 1995, aim to raise standards and
improve Britain’s international
competitiveness. Progress towards these
targets is monitored by the independent
National Advisory Council for Education and
Training Targets and by the Advisory
Scottish Council for Education and Training
Targets. The Targets, which relate to the year
2000, cover young people and the workforce as
a whole. The ‘Foundation Learning’ Targets
are that:
• by the age of 19, 85 per cent of young
people should achieve five GCSEs at
grade C or above, an intermediate
GNVQ_or NVQJevel 2;
• 75 per cent of young people should
achieve NVQ^level 2 competence in
communication, numeracy and
information technology by the age of 19,
with 35 per cent reaching level 3 by the
age of 21; and
450
EDUCATION
• by 21, 60 per cent of young people
should achieve two GCE A levels, an
Advanced GNVQ^or NVQJevel 3.
The ‘Lifetime Learning’ Targets are that:
• 60 per cent of the workforce should be
qualified to the standard of NVQJevel 3,
an Advanced GNVQ^or two GCE A
levels;
• 30 per cent of the workforce should have
a vocational, professional, management
or academic qualification at NVQJevel or
above; and
• 70 per cent of organisations employing.
200 or more people and 35 per cent of
those employing 50 or more should be
recognised as Investors in People.
Targets in Scotland are that:
• by the age of 19, 85 per cent of young
people should attain SVQjstandard level
II or five standard SCE grades 1-3 or
equivalent; and
• by the age of 21, 70 per cent of young
people should achieve SVQJevel III or
three Highers (grades A-C).
The Government plans to conduct an
extensive consultation exercise from
November 1997 to February 1998 which will
assess how appropriate these Targets are and
consider developing new ones which fully
reflect its priorities.
Investors in People
The Investors in People standard helps
companies and other employers to improve
their performance by linking the training and
development of all employees directly to the
achievement of business objectives (see p. 175).
Youth Training
The objectives of the Government’s youth
training schemes are to provide participants
with training leading to NVQ/SVQ^vocational
qualifications and the acquisition of broad-
based skills.
As part of the new Investing in Young
People programme, National Traineeships for
training to NVQJevels 1 and 2 will take effect
from the autumn of 1997 for young people in
England and Wales. They offer a broad and
flexible learning programme, including the
skills of communication, numeracy and
information technology.
Modern Apprenticeships are designed to
increase significantly the number of young
people trained to technician, supervisory and
equivalent levels. More than 100,000 of them
have begun these apprenticeships, which
operate in over 70 industry sectors (see p. 176).
Higher Education
There are six times as many pupils taking part
in higher education now than in the early
1960s. One in three young people now enter
higher education compared with one in six in
1989. Over half of all entrants are mature
students (aged 22 or over) and just over a third
are part-timers. Since 1989 full-time students
have increased by almost 70 per cent.
Bearing Committee Report
The Government is planning to publish a
White Paper on Lifelong Learning in response
to the conclusions of the National Committee
of Inquiry into Higher Education, which was
set up February 1996 under the chairmanship
of Sir Ron Dearing. The committee was
established to make recommendations on the
purposes, structure, size and funding of
higher education throughout Britain. Its
report, published in July 1997 and welcomed
by the Government, supported a further

expansion of up to 40 per cent in higher
education over the next 20 years. The main
recommendations covered the local and
regional role of higher education, the
qualifications framework, academic standards,
the role of information technology,
management and government of institutions,
and the quality of teaching and research.
In Scotland a separate committee has made
recommendations on the distinctive nature of
the Scottish higher education system.
Finance
Higher education is largely financed by public
funds and income received by institutions
from research contracts and other sources.
Tuition fees for students are at present paid
through the students awards system (see
below).
Government finance for higher education
institutions in England, Scotland and Wales is
distributed by higher education funding
councils responsible to their respective
Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland grant
is paid direct to the two universities by the
Department of Education, following advice
from the Northern Ireland Higher Education
Council. The private University of
Buckingham receives no public grants.
The funding councils and the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland help to
meet the costs of teaching, research and
related activities in all publicly funded
universities and higher education colleges. In
addition to teaching students, institutions
undertake paid training, research or
consultancy for commercial firms. Many
establishments have endowments or receive
grants from foundations and benefactors.
Some 30 per cent of higher education income
originates from private sources.
Student Finance
Over 95 per cent of full-time students resident
in England and Wales on first degree and
other comparable higher education courses
receive mandatory awards covering tuition
fees and a maintenance grant. The level of the
grant depends on the income of the student
and of the student’s parents or spouse. Awards
are made by LEAs in England and Wales. The
Government reimburses in full the amount
spent by education authorities on mandatory
awards. Similar schemes are administered by
the Student Awards Agency for Scotland and
the Northern Ireland education and library
boards.
Most students on courses of full-time, non¬
postgraduate higher education can also take
out a loan to help pay their maintenance costs.
Loans are not means-tested and repayments
are indexed to inflation. The scheme is
designed to share the cost of student
maintenance more equitably between
students, parents and the taxpayer.
Limited access funds administered by
universities and colleges are available to
students facing real financial difficulties. In
1996-97 there is provision of £27.7. million in
England, £4.3 million in Scotland, £1.7
million in Wales and £868,000 in Northern
Ireland for this purpose.
The Government has announced plans to
reform the system of student finance from
October 1998 in order to share the costs of
higher education with those who benefit from it.
The plans include the introduction of an annual
tuition fee representing about a quarter of the
average cost of a course. Tuition will continue
to be free for students from lower income
families. Other full-time students will pay up to
£1,000 a year depending on parental income.
All students will be eligible for 100 per cent
loans for maintenance, a part of which will be
related to parental income. The total parental
contribution will be no more than is expected at
present. Loans will be repaid by graduates,
contributions being related to their income. The
average repayment period will be much longer
than at present, ensuring that average
repayments will be at a lower annual level.
Grants for postgraduate study are offered
by the government education departments and
by the research councils (see pp. 337-40).
Increasing numbers of scholarships are
available from research charities, endowments
and particular industries or companies.
Access Courses
Access and foundation courses provide a
preparation before enrolment on a course of
452
EDUCATION
higher education for prospective students who
do not have the standard entry qualifications.
Many of these students are from the ethnic
minority communities.
The Scottish Wider Access Programme
(SWAP) promotes greater participation in
higher education by mature students and
those without the normal entry requirements.
Successful completion of a SWAP course
guarantees a higher education place.
Universities
There are some 90 universities, including the
Open University, which enjoy academic
freedom, appoint their own staff, decide which
students to admit and award their own
degrees. The universities of Oxford and
Cambridge date from the 13th century, and
the Scottish universities of St Andrews,
Glasgow and Aberdeen from the 15th century.
The University of Edinburgh was established
in the 16th century. All the other universities
were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The 1960s saw considerable expansion in new
universities. The number of universities also
jumped considerably in 1992, when
polytechnics and their Scottish equivalents
were given their own degree-awarding powers
and were allowed to take the university title.
At the same time, similar provision was made
for higher education colleges which met
certain criteria.
Applications for first degree courses are
usually made through the Universities and
Colleges Admission Service (UCAS), in
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
First degree courses are mainly full-time
and usually last three years in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. However, there are
some four-year courses, and medical and
veterinary courses normally require five years.
All traditional first degree courses in Scotland
require a minimum of three years’ study (or
four years to honours level). The ratio of staff
to full-time students in England is about 1 to
16.5. The number of postgraduates has
increased by over a half in the last decade.
Universities offer courses in a wide range of
subjects, including traditional arts subjects
and science and technology. Some courses
lead to the examinations of the chief
professional bodies. Many universities have
close links with commerce and industry; some
students have a job and attend on a part-time
basis.
Degree titles vary according to each
university. In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland the most common titles for a first
degree are Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor
of Science (BSc) and for a second degree
Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science
(MSc), or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). In the
older Scottish universities Master is used for a
first degree in arts subjects. Uniformity of
standards between universities is promoted by
employing external examiners for all
university examinations.
Some universities are responsible for
validating degrees at higher education
institutions without degree-awarding powers.
The Government is encouraging
universities to co-operate closely with industry
on research. Around 50 science parks have
been set up by higher education institutions in
conjunction with industrial scientists and
technologists to promote the development and
commercial application of advanced
technology (see chapter 20, p. 340).
The Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other courses
for adult students of all ages in Britain, the
European Union, Gibraltar, Slovenia and
Switzerland.
The University uses a combination of
specially produced printed texts,
correspondence tuition, television and radio
broadcasts, audio/video cassettes and
computing. For some courses there are
residential schools. There is a network of
study centres for contact with part-time tutors
and counsellors, and with fellow students.
Formal academic qualifications are not
required to register for most courses. Its first
degrees are the BA (Open) or the BSc (Open),
which are general degrees awarded on a
system of credits for each course completed.
There is also an MMath degree for students
who have taken an approved combination of
courses specialising in mathematics, and an
MEng degree for those who have studied an
453
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
approved combination of courses to achieve
the highest professional status of Chartered
Engineer. In 1997 there were about 135,000
registered undergraduates, and in all 200,000
first degrees have been awarded since the
University started its courses in 1970.
The University also has a programme of
higher degrees. About 15,000 students were
registered on higher degree courses in 1997. In
addition, there are programmes for
professionals in a variety of fields.
The University has advised many other
countries on setting up similar institutions,
and has contributed to projects such as the
European Distance Education Network. It is
financed by the Higher Education Funding
Council for England.
University for Industry
The Government has announced plans to set
up a new University for Industry which will
collaborate with the Open University. It is
designed to increase opportunities for adults
wishing to develop their potential and will
bring government, industry and education
together in a public/private partnership. It
will use new technology to increase skills and
extend lifelong learning.
Further Education for Adults
Further education for adults is provided by
further education institutions, adult centres and
colleges run by LEAs, and voluntary bodies
such as the Workers’ Educational Association.
The duty to secure such education is shared by
the further education funding councils, The
Scottish Office Education and Industry
Department and LEAs. University
departments of continuing education also
provide courses for adults.
The councils and The Scottish Office
Education and Industry Department fund
formal academic and vocational courses,
courses providing access to higher education
and courses in basic literacy and numeracy,
including English for speakers of other
languages. LEAs are responsible for the less
formal leisure and recreational courses. The
councils, The Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department and the LEAs must take
account of adult students with special
educational needs.
Basic Skills Agency
The Basic Skills Agency is concerned with
adult literacy, numeracy and related basic
skills in England and Wales. It provides
consultancy and advisory services; funds local
development projects, including research;
publishes materials for teachers and students;
and organises and sponsors staff training. The
Agency also covers basic skill training in the
workplace for unemployed and young people.
Government funding of the Agency was worth
about £4 million in 1995-96.
NIACE (The National Organisation
for Adult Learning)
NIACE represents all interests in the education
and training of adults. It is a membership body
and a registered charity. It convenes
conferences, seminars and meetings, collects
and disseminates information, conducts
inquiries and research, undertakes special
projects and works with other organisations.
Open and Distance Learning
The terms ‘open’ and ‘distance’ learning
broadly mean learning undertaken through
use of various media, such as television,
without the direct supervision of a tutor. More
further education colleges are incorporating
many distance learning materials and methods
in their mainstream courses.
Scottish Community Education Council
The Scottish Community Education Council
advises the Government and promotes all
community education matters, including adult
literacy and basic education, and youth work.
Educational Research
Educational research is supported financially
by government departments, the Economic
and Social Research Council, charities, higher
education institutions, teachers’ associations
454
EDUCATION
and other agencies. The major research
institutions outside the universities are the
autonomous National Foundation for
Educational Research in England and Wales,
and the Scottish Council for Research in
Education.
LINKS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
Large numbers of people come to Britain from
other countries to study, and many
British people work and train overseas. The
British aid programme (see chapter 9, p. 136)
encourages links between educational
institutions in Britain and developing countries.
There has been an expansion of interest in
European studies and languages in recent
years, with exchanges of teachers,
schoolchildren and students taking place.
European Union Schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU
SOCRATES programme, through which
grants are provided to enable EU students and
those from other countries belonging to the
European Economic Area (see p. 126) to study
in other states. The programme covers all
academic subjects, and the period of study
normally lasts between three and 12 months.
In 1996-97 about 11,000 British students were
studying in other EU member states.
The SOCRATES programme also
promotes competence in foreign languages. It
offers funding which contributes towards in-
service training methods. Other parts of the
programme support partnerships between
schools, study visits by senior educationalists
and a range of multinational projects including
open and distance learning, adult education
and education for the children of migrant
workers, gypsies and travellers.
Youth for Europe III aims to bring together
young people from different cultural and
social backgrounds in the European Union
through a wide range of exchanges.
The LEONARDO DA VINCI programme
supports and complements vocational training
policies and practices in member states,
fostering transnational co-operation and
innovation in training through pilot projects,
exchanges and research projects.
EU member states have created nine
European schools, including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire, for pupils aged between four and
19, to provide a multilingual education for the
children of staff employed in EU institutions.
Overseas Students in Britain
British universities and other higher and
further education establishments have built
up a strong reputation overseas by offering
tuition of the highest standards and
maintaining low student-to-staff ratios.
In 1995-96 there were some 500,000
overseas students at publicly funded higher
and further education institutions in Britain.
Most overseas students following courses of
higher or further education pay fees covering
the full cost of their courses.
Nationals of other member countries of the
European Union generally pay the lower level
of fees applicable to British students; if their
courses are designated for mandatory awards,
they may be eligible for fees-only awards from
LEAs. Students attending Scottish
institutions apply to either the Student
Awards Agency for Scotland, the appropriate
local council or one of the 43 Scottish
incorporated further education colleges,
depending on the place and level of the
course.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for foreign students and trainees
through its overseas aid programme and other
award and scholarship schemes. In 1996—97
some 4,500 overseas students were supported.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office
(FCO) finances the British Chevening
Scholarships, a worldwide programme
offering outstanding graduate students and
young professionals the opportunity to spend
time studying at British universities and other
academic institutions. In 1996-97 the FCO
spent some £32 million on over 3,000
scholarships for students from 150 countries.
These included jointly funded scholarships for
overseas students co-sponsored by the FCO,
business and industry, grant-giving
foundations, the Churches and universities;
455
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
some 750 scholarships were provided under
these arrangements.
Outside the aid programme, the Overseas
Research Students Awards Scheme, funded
by the higher education funding councils,
provides assistance for overseas full-time
postgraduate students with outstanding
research potential.
Other Schemes
Many public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas. Among the best known are the
British Council Fellowships, the
Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship
Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the
British Marshall Scholarships, the Rhodes
Scholarships, the Churchill Scholarships and
the Confederation of British Industry
Scholarships. Most British universities and
colleges offer bursaries and scholarships for
which graduates of any nationality are eligible.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The youth service—a partnership between
local government and voluntary
organisations—is concerned with the informal
personal and social education of young people
aged 11 to 25 (5 to 25 in Northern Ireland).
Local authorities maintain their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional voluntary
organisations. The service is said to reach
around 5 million young people, the voluntary
organisations contributing a significant
proportion of overall provision.
The Department for Education and
Employment’s Youth Service Unit gives
grants to the national voluntary youth
organisations to meet 50 per cent of the cost of
programmes designed to promote access to the
youth service, support training for voluntary
youth workers and help improve the
effectiveness of the organisations.
Funded primarily by local government,
England’s National Youth Agency provides:
• support for those working with young
people; and
• information and publishing services.
The Welsh Office sponsors the Wales
Youth Agency, which is the agent for payment
of grant aid to national youth service bodies
with headquarters in Wales; it is also
responsible for the accreditation of training
and staff development for youth workers.
In Scotland the youth service forms part of
the community education provision made by
local authorities. It is also promoted by the
Scottish Community Education Council. The
Scottish Office gives grants to voluntary youth
organisations to assist them with their
headquarters expenditure and staff training.
In Northern Ireland the education and
library boards provide and fund youth clubs
and outdoor activity centres. They assist with
the running costs of registered voluntary
youth units and provide advice and support to
youth groups. Boards also assist young people
visiting the rest of Britain, Ireland and
overseas. The Youth Council for Northern
Ireland advises the education system on the
development of the youth service. It promotes
the provision of facilities, encourages cross¬
community activity and pays grants to the
headquarters of voluntary bodies.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake a significant share of youth
activities through local groups, which raise
most of their day-to-day expenses by their
own efforts. Many receive financial and other
help from LEAs, which also make available
facilities in many areas. The voluntary
organisations vary greatly in character and
include the uniformed organisations, such as
the Scouts and Girl Guides. Some
organisations are church-based. Some also
represent Jews and Muslims. Sport and the
arts are catered for by various bodies. In
Wales, Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh
League of Youth) provides cultural, sporting
and language-based activities for young Welsh
speakers and learners.
Thousands of youth clubs encourage their
members to participate in sport, cultural and
other creative activities. Some youth clubs
provide information, counselling and advice.
Many local authorities and voluntary youth
organisations make provision for the young
456
EDUCATION
unemployed, young people from the ethnic
minorities, young people in inner cities or
rural areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Other areas of concern are
homelessness and provision for handicapped
young people.
Many authorities have youth committees
on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented. They employ youth officers to
co-ordinate youth work and to arrange in-
service training.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified youth
and community workers; several
undergraduate part-time and postgraduate
courses are also available. In Scotland one-,
two- and three-year courses are provided at
colleges of education. Students from
Northern Ireland attend courses run in
universities and colleges in Britain and the
Irish Republic.
Other Organisations
Finance is provided by many grant-giving
foundations and trusts for activities involving
young people. The Prince’s Trust and the
Royal Jubilee Trust provide grants and
practical help to individuals and organisations;
areas of concern include urban deprivation,
unemployment, homelessness, and young
offenders. Efforts are also made to assist
ethnic minorities.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
challenges young people from Britain and
other Commonwealth countries to meet
certain standards in activities such as
community service, expeditions, social and
practical skills and physical recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to help
those in need, including elderly and disabled
people. Many schools also organise community
service work as part of the curriculum.

Everyone in Britain has the right to religious freedom without interference
from the community or the State. Religious organisations and groups may own
property, conduct their rites and ceremonies, run schools, and promote their
beliefs in speech and writing, within the limits of the law. There is no religious
bar to the holding of public office.
INTRODUCTION
Although Britain is predominantly Christian,
most of the world’s religions are represented in
the country. There are large Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim and Sikh communities, and also
smaller communities of Baha’is, Buddhists,
Jains and Zoroastrians, as well as followers of
new religious movements and pagans. Non¬
religious alternatives for humanists and atheists
are offered by organisations such as the British
Humanist Association and the National Secular
Society, although most humanists and atheists
do not belong to organised groups. Many
Britons would class themselves as agnostic.
There has been a fall in recent years in the
number of full-time ministers and the number of
adults recorded as members of most of the larger
Christian churches. At the same time there has
been significant growth in a range of independent
churches, and in new religious movements.
Surveys have also revealed that many people who
do not belong to religious groups claim to be
religious and say they believe in God.
Religious Freedom
Freedom of conscience in religious matters
was achieved gradually from the 17th century
onwards. The older laws discriminating
against minority religious groups were
gradually enforced less harshly and then
finally repealed. Heresy ceased to be a legal
offence with the passage of the Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration Act
1688 granted freedom of worship to Protestant
minority groups, such as the Religious Society
of Friends (Quakers—see p. 462) and other
non-conformists.
In 1828 the repeal of the Test and
Corporation Acts gave nonconformist
Protestant Christians full political rights,
making it possible for them to be appointed to
public office. Roman Catholics gained political
rights under the Roman Catholic Relief Act
1829, and the Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled
Jews to become Members of Parliament. The
religious tests imposed on prospective
students and academic staff of the universities
of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were
successively abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856
and 1871. Similar restrictions on the staff of
Scottish universities were formally removed in
1932.
The past 30 years have seen an increasingly
diverse pattern of religious belief and
affiliation in Britain. This has been linked
458
RELIGION
both to patterns of immigration and to new
religious directions among some of the
indigenous population. Social structures have
been gradually changing to accommodate this.
For example, arrangements are made at many
places of work to allow the members of the
various faiths to follow their religious
observances.
Relations with the State
There are two established churches in Britain,
that is, churches legally recognised as official
churches of the State: in England the Anglican
Church of England, and in Scotland the
Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The
Monarch is pledged by the coronation oath to
defend each Church in its respective territory.
There is no longer an established Church in
Wales or in Northern Ireland. Ministers of the
established churches, as well as clergy
belonging to other religious groups, work in
services run by the State, such as the armed
forces, national hospitals and prisons, and may
be paid a state salary for such services.
Voluntary schools provided by religious
denominations may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds. Religious
education in publicly maintained schools is
required by law, as is a daily act of collective
worship (see p. 440). Religious broadcasting is
subject to some legislative controls (see p.
497).
The State does not contribute to the
general expenses of church maintenance,
although some state aid does help repair
historic churches. In 1996—97, for instance,
English Heritage grants to churches totalled
£10.3 million as compared with the £100
million spent on the buildings by parishes.
Assistance is also given to meet some of the
costs of repairing cathedrals; some £4 million
was made available in 1996—97. This funding
is not restricted to Church of England
buildings.
The Government shares with the Church
of England the upkeep of over 300 churches of
special architectural or historic importance
which are no longer required for regular
parish use and for which no alternative use can
be found. The contribution for the period
1995 to 1998 is about £7.5 million. The
Historic Chapels Trust, launched in 1993,
aims to preserve the redundant chapels and
places of worship of other denominations and
faiths, including synagogues and temples,
which are of particular architectural or historic
interest.
Involvement in Social Issues
Religious involvement in broader social issues
was highlighted in the Church of England’s
report Faith in the City: A Call for Action by
Church and Nation, published in 1985. This
led to the establishment of the Church of
England’s Church Urban Fund, an
independent charity which raises money to
enable people living in urban priority areas to
found projects which alleviate the effects of
poverty on their lives. By June 1997 it had
made grants totalling £27.1 million to 1,250
different projects.
The General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland debates annual reports from its
Committee on Church and Nation on social,
economic, and political matters; and, through
its Board of Social Responsibility, is the largest
voluntary social work agency in Scotland.
Organisations belonging to other churches
and religious groups are also closely involved
with a wide range of social issues (see, for
example, the work of the Salvation Army,
p. 462).
The Inner Cities Religious Council, formed
in 1992 and based in the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions, is a
forum for discussion between the faiths and
the Government, and encourages practical
regeneration in the inner cities and run-down
housing estates elsewhere. Chaired by a
government minister, the Council comprises
senior leaders of the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim,
Sikh and Christian faiths, including the
majority Black churches.
Unemployment and the Future of Work: an
Enquiry for the Churches—a major report
examining the problems of unemployment—
was published by the Council of Churches for
Britain and Ireland (see p. 463) in April 1997.
Proposed solutions to unemployment include
support for a statutory minimum wage, the
implementation of a maximum 48-hour week,
and an increase in taxes for high earners.
459
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Sacred Land Project
The Sacred Land Project, launched in April
1997, plans to conserve or create over 2,000
sacred sites in Britain during the next five
years. Sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund
for Nature, the Project will work with local
communities, religious groups, and
conservation and environmental organisations
to re-open ancient pilgrim routes, create new
pilgrim paths, help restore old shrines and
sacred sites and develop sacred gardens. It not
only celebrates Britain’s multi-faith society but
also demonstrates practical ways to improve
quality of life through care of the natural
environment. The Project has the support of all
the major Christian churches, as well as most of
the other faiths practised in Britain.
An example of a current project is the Holy
Island Interfaith Centre and Garden,
Scotland. This island, which is the site of the
cave of a 6th-century hermit and of a 13th-
century Christian monastery, is now owned by
the Samye Ling Tibetan Buddhist Centre.
The Sacred Land Project is helping the
Centre to replant over 27,000 trees on the
island and is advising on the creation of a new
monastic garden incorporating Christian and
Buddhist sacred garden traditions.
Statistics on Religious Affiliation
There is no standard information about the
number of members of religious groups, since
questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses or for other official
purposes, except in Northern Ireland. Each
group adopts its own way of counting its
members, and the membership figures in this
chapter—often supplied by the religious
groups themselves—are therefore approximate.
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY
Church of England
The Church of England became the
established church during the Reformation in
the 16th century. Conflicts between Church
and State culminated in the Act of Supremacy
in 1534, which repudiated papal supremacy
and declared Henry VIII to be Supreme Head
of the Church of England. The Church of
England’s form of worship was set out in
successive versions of the Book of Common
Prayer from 1549 onwards. The Church’s
relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation, since the Church’s privileges are
balanced by certain duties it must fulfil.
The Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’
of the Church of England and must always be
a member of the Church, and promise to
uphold it. Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans of cathedrals are appointed
by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime
Minister, although the Crown Appointments
Commission, which includes lay and clergy
representatives, plays a key role in the
selection of archbishops and diocesan bishops.
All clergy swear allegiance to the Crown. The
Church can regulate its own worship. The two
archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the
bishops of London, Durham and Winchester,
and 21 other senior bishops sit in the House of
Lords. Clergy of the Church, together with
those of the Church of Scotland, the Church
of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church,
may not sit in the House of Commons.
The Church of England is divided into two
provinces: Canterbury, comprising 30
dioceses, including the Diocese in Europe; and
York, with 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
divided into archdeaconries and deaneries,
which are in turn divided into about 13,000
parishes, although in practice many of these
are grouped together. There are, altogether,
about 10,000 full-time stipendiary Church of
England clergy—men and women—working
within the diocesan structure, excluding
mainland Europe. In 1995 an estimated
194,300 people were baptised into the Church
in the two provinces, excluding the Diocese in
Europe; of these, 148,000 were under one year
old, representing 24 per cent of live births. In
the same year there were 29,500 confirmations.
Attendances at services on a normal Sunday
are just over one million. In 1993, 91,214
marriages were solemnised in the Church of
England. These accounted for 66 per cent of
all marriages with religious ceremonies, and 32
per cent of all marriages in England. Many
people who rarely, if ever, attend services still
regard themselves as belonging to the Church
of England.
460
RELIGION
The central governing and legislative body
is the General Synod, which comprises
separate houses of bishops, clergy and lay
members. Lay people are also involved with
church government in the parishes. The
Synod is the centre of an administrative
system dealing with missionary work, inter¬
church relations, social questions, and
recruitment and training for the ministry. It
also covers other church work in Britain and
overseas, the care of church buildings and
their contents, church schools (which are
maintained largely from public funds),
colleges and institutes of higher education,
and voluntary and parish education.
The Church Commissioners are
responsible for managing the greater part of
the Church of England’s assets. The Prime
Minister appoints an MP to the unpaid post of
Second Church Estates Commissioner to
represent the Commissioners in Parliament.
There are plans to transfer certain powers of
the Commissioners to the newly created
Archbishops’ Council, chaired by the
Archbishops of Canterbury and York.
Apart from the Church Commissioners’
income, most of the remainder of the
Church’s income is provided by local
voluntary donations. The average annual
stipend of a Church of England priest is about
£13,450; the average value of additional
benefits, including free housing and a non¬
contributory pension, is £7,015.
The first women priests were ordained in
1994 and there are now 859 stipendiary
women clergy. Women priests can now be
appointed to all offices in the Church, except
those of archbishop or bishop. Three bishops
have been appointed to provide additional
pastoral care to those members and parishes of
the Church who remain opposed to the
ordination of women to the priesthood.
Other Anglican Churches
The Church of England is part of a worldwide
communion of Anglican churches. These are
similar in organisation and worship to the
Church of England and originated from it.
There are four distinct Anglican Churches in
the British Isles, each governed separately by
its own institutions: the Church of England,
the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Church of Ireland (which
operates in both Northern Ireland and the
Irish Republic). The Church of Ireland was
disestablished in 1869 and the Church in
Wales in 1920.
The Anglican Communion comprises 36
autonomous Churches in Britain and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas, with a
total membership of about 70 million. Links
between the components of the Anglican
Communion are maintained by the Lambeth
Conference of Anglican bishops, which is held
every ten years, the next Conference being
held in Canterbury in 1998. Presided over by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference
has no executive authority, but enjoys
considerable influence. The Anglican
Consultative Council, an assembly of lay
people and clergy as well as of bishops, meets
every two or three years to allow consultation
within the Anglican Communion. The
Primates Meeting brings together the senior
bishops from each Church at similar intervals.
A new museum on the site of St
Augustine’s Abbey in Canterbury opened
in May 1997, to mark the 1,400th
anniversary of the arrival of St Augustine
in England. The museum contains
decorated mediaeval stonework and tiles,
shrines and reliquaries excavated on the
site of the Abbey, most of them on display
for the first time.
Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian
form of government, that is, government by
church courts, composed of ministers and
elders (presbyters), all of whom are ordained to
office, and also deacons. It became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation in
the late 16th century and legislation enacted by
the Scottish Parliament. The Church’s status
was then consolidated in the Treaty of Union
of 1707 and by the Church of Scotland Act
1921, the latter confirming its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. It appoints its
own office bearers, and its affairs are not
subject to any civil authority.
461
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The adult communicant membership of the
Church of Scotland is over 680,000; there are
about 1,200 ministers serving in parishes.
Both men and women may join the ministry.
The 1,292 churches are governed locally by
Kirk Sessions, consisting of ministers and
elders. Above the Kirk Session is the
Presbytery. The General Assembly, consisting
of elected ministers, elders and deacons, meets
annually under the chairmanship of an elected
moderator, who serves for one year. The
Monarch is normally represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High
Commissioner.
There are also a number of independent
Scottish Presbyterian churches, largely
descended from groups which broke away
from the Church of Scotland. They are
particularly active in the Highlands and
Islands.
Free Churches
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe those Protestant churches in Britain
which, unlike the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, are not established
churches. Free Churches have existed in
various forms since the Reformation,
developing their own traditions over the years.
Their members have also been known as
dissenters or nonconformists. While this
historical experience has given these churches
a certain sense of shared identity, they
otherwise vary greatly in doctrine, worship
and church government. All the major Free
Churches—Methodist, Baptist, United
Reformed and Salvation Army—allow both
men and women to become ministers.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the
Free Churches, with almost 380,270 adult full
members and a community of more than 1.2
million, originated in the 18th century
following the Evangelical Revival under John
Wesley (1703-91). The present church is
based on the 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. It has 3,660
ministers and 6,678 places of worship.
MAYC, the youth service of the Methodist
Church, serves over 60,000 young people aged
13 to 25. Each year MAYC organises London
Weekend, one of the largest youth events in
Europe, bringing together dance, drama, rock
music and worship produced and performed
by youth groups from all over Great Britain.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in Britain in the 17th century. Today
they are mainly organised in groups of
churches, most of which belong to the Baptist
Union of Great Britain (re-formed in 1812),
with about 152,600 members, 2,418 ministers
and 2,130 places of worship. There are also
separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales
and Ireland, and other independent Baptist
Churches.
The third largest of the Free Churches is
the United Reformed Church, with some
97,500 members, 1,818 ministers and 1,750
places of worship. It was formed in 1972
following the merger of the Congregational
Church in England and Wales (the oldest
Protestant minority in Britain, whose origins
can be traced back to the Puritans of the 16th
century) with the Presbyterian Church of
England (a church closely related in doctrine
and worship to the Church of Scotland). In
1981 there was a further merger with the Re¬
formed Association of the Churches of Christ.
Alongside these churches are other historic
Free Church bodies. The Salvation Army was
founded in the East End of London in 1865 by
William Booth (1829-1912). Within Britain it
is second only to the Government as a
provider of social services. It is the largest
provider of hostel accommodation, offering
almost 3,355 beds every night. Other services
include work with alcoholics, prison
chaplaincy and a family tracing service which
receives 5,000 enquiries each year. The
Salvation Army in Britain is served by around
1,732 officers (ordained ministers) and runs
some 986 worship centres.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 17,500 adult members
and 9,000 attenders in Britain and 460 places
of worship, was founded in the middle of the
17th century under the leadership of George
Fox (1624-91). It has no ordained ministers
and no formal liturgy or sacraments. Silent
worship is central to its life as a religious
organisation. Emphasis is also placed on social
concern and peacemaking.
Among the other Free Churches are: the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the largest
462
RELIGION
Protestant church in Northern Ireland, where
it has 304,000 members; the Presbyterian (or
Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, with
51,720 members and the largest of the Free
Churches in Wales; and the Union of Welsh
Independents (42,440 members).
A recent development has been the rise of
Pentecostalism and the charismatic
movement. A number of Pentecostalist bodies
were formed in Britain at the turn of the
century. The two main Pentecostalist
organisations operating in Britain today are
the Assemblies of God (approximately 55,000
members, over 900 ministers and over 660
places of worship) and the Elim Pentecostal
Church. Since the Second World War
immigration from the Caribbean has led to the
growth of a significant number of majority
Black Pentecostalist churches.
In the early 1960s a Pentecostalist charismatic
movement began to influence some followers in
both the Church of England and the Roman
Catholic Church; it remains a growing influence
in both these churches, and in the historic Free
Churches. The Christian ‘house church’
movement (or ‘new churches’) began in the early
1970s, when some charismatics began to
establish their own congregations. Services were
originally held in private houses although many
congregations have now acquired their own
buildings. The movement, whose growth has
been most marked in England, is characterised
by lay leadership and is organised into a number
of loose fellowships, usually on a regional basis,
such as the Ichthus Fellowship in south-east
London.
Roman Catholic Church
The formal structure of the Roman Catholic
Church in England and Wales, which ceased
to exist after the Reformation, was restored in
1850. The Scottish Roman Catholic Church’s
formal structure went out of existence in the
early 17th century and was restored in 1878.
However, throughout this period Catholicism
never disappeared entirely. There are now
seven Roman Catholic provinces in Great
Britain, each under an archbishop, and 30
dioceses, each under a bishop (22 in England
and Wales and eight in Scotland,
independently responsible to the Pope). There
are 3,319 parishes and about 4,800 priests
(only men may become priests). Northern
Ireland has six dioceses, some with territory
partly in the Irish Republic. About one British
citizen in ten claims to be a Roman Catholic.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great
importance to the education of its children and
requires its members to try to bring up their
children in the Catholic faith. Some 1.5 per
cent of the teachers in Britain’s 2,438 Catholic
schools are members of religious orders. These
orders also undertake other social work, such as
nursing, childcare and running homes for
elderly people. There are approximately 12,000
members of religious orders in England,
Scotland and Wales. Most Catholic schools are
maintained out of public funds.
Other Christian Churches
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians and Free Christians, whose origins
are traceable to the Reformation.
The Christian Brethren are a Protestant
body organised in their present form by J. N.
Darby (1800-82). There are two branches: the
Open Brethren and the Closed or Exclusive
Brethren.
Many Christian communities founded by
migrant communities, including the Orthodox,
Lutheran and Reformed Churches of various
European countries, the Coptic Orthodox
Church and the Armenian Church, have
established their own centres of worship,
particularly in London. All these churches
operate in a variety of languages. The largest is
probably the Greek Orthodox Church, many of
whose members are of Cypriot origin. It is
represented in many cities throughout Britain.
There are also several other religious
groups in Britain which were founded in the
United States in the last century. These
include the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Church
of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints (the
Mormon Church), the Christadelphians, the
Seventh-Day Adventists, the Christian
Scientists and the Spiritualists.
Co-operation among the Churches
The Council of Churches for Britain and
Ireland (formerly the British Council of
463
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Churches) is the main overall body for the
Christian churches in Britain. The Council
co-ordinates the work of its 32 member
churches and associations of churches, in the
areas of social responsibility, international
affairs, church life, world mission, racial
justice and inter-faith relations. The Council’s
member churches are also grouped in separate
ecumenical bodies, according to country:
Churches Together in England, Action of
Churches Together in Scotland, Churches
Together in Wales, and the Irish Council of
Churches.
The Free Church Federal Council, with 19
member denominations, includes most of the
Free Churches of England and Wales. It
promotes co-operation among the Free
Churches (especially in hospital chaplaincy and
in education matters).
The Evangelical Alliance, with a membership
of individuals, churches or societies drawn from
within 20 denominations, represents over 1
million evangelical Christians.
Inter-church discussions about the search
for Christian unity take place internationally,
as well as within Britain, and the main
participants are the Roman Catholic,
Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist,
Reformed and Baptist Churches. In 1995 the
Church of England and the Methodist Church
started informal meetings to consider moves
towards unity.
The Anglican Churches and the Church of
Scotland are among the 14 British Churches
which are members of the World Council of
Churches. This organisation links some 332
churches in over 120 countries around the
world.
OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES
The Buddhist Community
The Buddhist community in Britain consists
largely of adherents of British or Western
origin. There are well over 500 Buddhist
groups and centres, including some 50
monasteries and temples. All the main schools
of Buddhism are represented. The Buddhist
Society, founded in 1924, promotes the
principles of Buddhism; it does not belong to
any particular school of Buddhism.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in Britain comprises
around 320,000 members and originates
largely from India. The largest groups of
Hindus are to be found in Leicester, different
areas of London, Birmingham and Bradford.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was
opened in London in 1962 and there are now
over 150 mandirs in Britain, a number of
which are affiliated to the National Council of
Hindu Temples.
The Swaminarayan Hindu Mission, in
north London, has the largest Hindu temple
to be built outside India, together with an
extensive cultural complex which has
provision for conferences, exhibitions,
marriages, sports, and health clinics.
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of the
Norman Conquest and remained until
banished by royal decree in 1290. The present
community in Britain dates from 1656, having
been founded by Jews of Spanish and
Portuguese origin, known as Sephardim, who
now account for some three per cent of the
community. Later more settlers came from
Germany and Eastern Europe; they are known
as Ashkenazim.
The Jewish community in Britain numbers
about 285,000 and is, after that in France, the
largest in Western Europe. The main groups
are to be found in the Greater London area
(183,000), Manchester and Salford (28,000),
Leeds (10,000), and Brighton and Hove
(6,000). About 70 per cent are affiliated to
synagogues. Most Ashkenazi Jews (63 per
cent), acknowledge the authority of the Chief
Rabbi, while the more strictly observant (7 per
cent) have their own spiritual leaders, as do
the Sephardim. The Reform movement
(founded in 1840), the Liberal and Progressive
movement (founded in 1901), and the recently
established Masorti movement, account for
most of the remaining 30 per cent of
synagogue members.
Jewish congregations in Britain number
about 360. The Board of Deputies of British
Jews is the officially recognised representative
body for all these groups. Founded in 1760, it
464
RELIGION
is mainly elected by synagogues. The Board
serves as the voice of the community to both
government and the wider non-Jewish
community.
A large-scale survey of British Jews,
conducted by the Institute of Jewish Policy
Research, was published in 1996. This reports
that 44 per cent of Jewish men aged under 40
are married, or living with, non-Jewish
partners, and that among Jewish women in
this age range, 20 to 25 per cent marry outside
the Jewish community.
Roughly one in three Jewish children
attend Jewish day schools, some of which are
supported by public funds. Several agencies
care for elderly and handicapped people.
The Muslim Community
Figures given for the size of the Muslim
community in Britain range from three-
quarters of a million to 2 million. Recent
estimates, based on extrapolations from the
1991 census, suggest the population is
between 1 million and 1.5 million, while
estimates from within the Muslim community
suggest between 1.5 million and 2 million.
The largest number originate from Pakistan
and Bangladesh, while sizeable groups have
come from India, Cyprus, the Arab world,
Malaysia and parts of Africa. There is a
growing number of British-born Muslims,
mainly the children of immigrant parents, but
including an increasing number of converts to
Islam.
There are over 600 mosques and numerous
Muslim prayer centres throughout Britain.
Mosques are not only places of worship; they
also offer instruction in the Muslim way of life
and facilities for educational and welfare
activities.
The first mosque in Britain was established
at Woking, Surrey, in 1890. Mosques now
range from converted houses in many towns to
the Central Mosque in Regent’s Park,
London, and its associated Islamic Cultural
Centre, one of the most important Muslim
institutions in the Western world. The
Central Mosque has the largest congregation
in Britain, and during festivals it may number
over 30,000. The Islamic Cultural Centre’s
activities include a weekend school for
children, and regular lectures, seminars and
conferences. Pastoral care includes free legal
advice, counselling, marriage and funeral
services, and prison and hospital visiting.
There are also important mosques and
cultural centres in Liverpool, Manchester,
Leicester, Birmingham, Bradford, Cardiff,
Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Many of the mosques are administered by
various local Muslim organisations, and both
the Sunni and the Shi’a traditions within
Islam are represented among the Muslim
community in Britain. Members of some of
the major Sufi traditions have also developed
branches in British cities. The Ismaili Centre
in London provides wide-ranging pastoral
care and a place of worship for Shi’a Imami
Ismaili Muslims, whose current Imam is
Prince Karim Aga Khan.
The Sikh Community
A large British Sikh community (estimates
range from 400,000 to 500,000) originates
mainly from India, and particularly from the
Punjab. The largest groups of Sikhs are in
Greater London, Manchester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Sikh
temples, or gurdwaras, cater for the religious,
educational, social welfare and cultural needs
of their community. A granthi is normally
employed to take care of the building and to
conduct prayers. The oldest gurdwara in
London was established in 1908 and the
largest is in Hounslow, Middlesex (to the west
of London). There are over 200 gurdwaras in
Britain.
Other Faiths
Small communities of other faiths include that
of the Jains, mainly living in London,
Leicester and Coventry. Jainism is an ancient
religion brought to Britain by immigrants
from India. A Jain temple (or derasar) opened
in Leicester in 1988. The Zoroastrian religion,
or Mazdaism, which originated in ancient
Iran, is mainly represented in Britain by the
Parsi community, whose ancestors left Iran in
the 10th century and settled in north-west
India. The Baha’i movement originated in
19th-century Iran; there are an estimated
465
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
6,000 Baha’is in Britain, organised in 500 local
assemblies and administered by the National
Spiritual Assembly in London.
There are also several thousand members of
the Ahmadiyya movement in Britain, who
consider themselves Muslim although are not
generally recognised as such by the Muslim
community.
A more recent development is
Rastafarianism. This emerged out of the back
to Africa movement in the West Indies early
this century, and arrived in Britain through
Jamaican immigration in the 1950s. It has no
single creed, but draws heavily on the Old
Testament.
New Religious Movements
A large number of new religious movements
are active in Britain. Sometimes popularly
referred to as cults they have been established
since the Second World War and often have
overseas origins. Examples include the
Church of Scientology, the Transcendental
Meditation movement, the Unification
Church (popularly known as the ‘Moonies’)
and various New Age groups. INFORM
(Information Network Focus on Religious
Movements), which is supported by the main
churches, carries out research and seeks to
provide objective information about new
religious movements. It was founded in
response to public concern about the activities
of some of these cults.
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FAITHS
A number of national organisations work to
promote good relations between different
religions in Britain. They include the Inter
Faith Network for the United Kingdom,
which links a wide range of organisations with
an interest in inter-faith relations, including
representative bodies from the Baha’i,
Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain, Jewish,
Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian faith groups.
The Network runs a public advice and
information service on inter-faith issues.
Other national organisations include the
Council of Christians and Jews, which works
for better understanding among members of
the two religions and deals with issues in the
educational and social fields.
Within each faith tradition are
organisations and individuals working to
further good relations with other faiths. For
example, the Council of Churches for Britain
and Ireland (see p. 463) has a Commission on
Inter Faith Relations.

Britain’s artistic and cultural heritage is one of the richest in the world. The
origins of English literature, one of the world’s most influential bodies of
writing, can be traced back to medieval times, its texts among the oldest
specimens of vernacular writing in Europe, while over the centuries Britain has
amassed some of the finest collections of works of art. The performing arts
also have a long and distinguished history. With the advent of the National
Lottery, arts funding in Britain has undergone the biggest change since the
system of support for the arts was established fifty years ago.
INTRODUCTION
London is one of the leading world centres for
the arts. Other large cities, including
Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Edinburgh,
Glasgow and Cardiff, have also sustained and
developed their reputations as centres of
artistic excellence in recent years. Arts
festivals attract wide interest. Many British
playwrights, craftspeople, composers, film¬
makers, painters, writers, actors, singers,
musicians and dancers enjoy international
reputations. They include, for example,
Harold Pinter, Sir Colin Davis, Andrew Lloyd
Webber, David Hockney, Sir V.S. Naipaul,
Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Ian McKellen and Sir
Anthony Hopkins. Television and radio bring
a range of arts events to a large audience. At an
amateur level, millions of people devote their
time and their talents to the benefit of local
communities.
Cultural industries play an important part
in Britain’s economy. An analysis of the 1991
Census, Employment in the Arts and Cultural
Industries,1 shows that the total number of
people in the cultural sector was 648,900,
representing 2.4 per cent of the economically
active population. The arts are a thriving
industry: it is estimated that the performing
and contemporary visual arts have an annual
turnover of well over £1,000 million.
Department for Culture, Media and
Sport
In May 1997 the former Department for
National Heritage was renamed the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
The Department (see p. 534), whose head
now becomes the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport, determines
government policy and administers
expenditure on national museums and art
galleries in England, the Arts Council of
England (see p. 468), the British Library and
1 Research Report No 2, Arts Council of England, 1995.
467
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
other national arts and heritage bodies. Other
responsibilities include the regulation of the
film industry, broadcasting and the press, the
National Lottery and the export licensing of
antiques. Under the new Government, the
Department has also acquired responsibility
for oversight of the music industries,
previously undertaken by the Department of
Trade and Industry.
The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible
for the arts in their countries, including the
national museums, galleries and libraries and
their respective Arts Councils (see below).
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport and the home departments provide
funds and advice, and encourage partnership
with the private sector, including business
sponsorship. The national museums and
galleries are also encouraged to increase their
resources through other means—for example,
trading. An important concept in funding
policy is the ‘arm’s length’ principle, by which
government funds are distributed to arts
organisations indirectly, through bodies such
as the Arts Councils, the British Film Institute
and Scottish Screen. This principle helps to
avoid political influence over funding
decisions by ensuring that funds are allocated
by those best qualified to do so.
New Government Policy Towards Cultural
Activity
The new Government has announced four
major principles behind its support for
cultural activity:
1. Culture must be made more accessible to
the many, not just to the few. (Proposals
already made include plans to pilot open
theatre nights and an artscard scheme for
young people, as well as reviewing the case
for admission charges to core collections
in national museums and galleries.)
2. Culture must become more a part of
everyday life, with encouragement given
to public culture projects, for example
bringing live art and contemporary
painting and sculpture to public spaces.
3. The need to recognise the enormous
economic importance of cultural activity
and its role in working towards high and
sustainable levels of employment.
4. The need to ensure that culture is made
an integral part of the education service.
A new interdepartmental Taskforce, whose
members include prominent figures in
business and culture, has been set up to
improve economic performance in the creative
industries.
Arts Councils
The main channels for government aid to the
contemporary and performing arts are the
independent Arts Councils of England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Their
aims are to: develop and improve the knowledge
and practice of these activities; make them more
accessible to the public; and advise and co¬
operate with central government departments,
local authorities and other organisations.
The Arts Councils give financial assistance
and advice to organisations ranging from the
major arts centres and opera, dance and drama
companies to small touring theatre companies
and experimental performance groups. They
also provide funds for the training of arts
administrators and help arts organisations to
develop other sources of income, including
sponsorship and local authority support. They
promote education, access and participation in
the arts through a variety of art forms,
including ballet and contemporary dance,
drama, literature, music, opera, visual arts and
photography, working with creative writers,
dramatists, choreographers, dancers, actors,
musicians, composers, artists and
photographers.
The Arts Council of England provides the
main funding for the ten Regional Arts Boards,
which offer financial assistance to artists and
arts organisations across England and advise
on, and sometimes help to promote, arts
activities. Other sources of funding for the
Boards come from the British Film Institute
and the Crafts Council, as well as from local
authorities. The Boards are responsible for
most of the funding of organisations within
their region.
The Arts Council of England also funds the
national companies—the Royal Opera, Royal
468
THE ARTS
Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet, English
National Opera, Royal Shakespeare Company,
Royal National Theatre and South Bank
Centre. It also funds touring companies
without a regional base and other arts
organisations with a national strategic role.
Finance
In England planned central government
expenditure through the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport in 1997-98
amounts to £221 million for museums and
galleries; £195 million for the contemporary
and performing arts; £103 million for
libraries; and £43 million for broadcasting and
the media. The grant for the arts is channelled
mainly through the Arts Council of England,
the Crafts Council and the National Heritage
Pairing Scheme for the Arts (see p. 470). In
addition the Arts Councils distribute National
Lottery proceeds to the arts, amounting to
approximately £250 million a year.
Planned 1997-98 expenditure by the Arts
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland is respectively £27 million, £13
million and £7.4 million.
The Scottish Office is also providing £40.4
million for Scotland’s National Galleries and
Museums and National Library, while the
Welsh Office is providing some £17 million
for Wales’s National Museum and National
Library. Planned spending by the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland on the
three major museums there amounts to about
£8.9 million in 1997—98.
National Lottery
The National Lottery (see p. 47) is providing a
major new source of funds to support arts
projects of all kinds in Britain. Its effects are
permeating all sectors of the arts.
By 1 July 1997, grants of almost £782.4
million had been distributed by the Arts
Councils and the Heritage Lottery Fund (see
p. 368) to a wide range of arts projects, from
major schemes such as £3.8 million to The
Tate Gallery in Merseyside and £3 million to
Armagh City and District Council, Northern
Ireland, for a new theatre/arts centre, to much
smaller grants for theatre restoration and
providing musical instruments to local bands
and youth clubs.
Two major new National Lottery schemes
run by the Arts Council of England were
launched in November 1996.
• The Arts for Everyone Main
programme is for projects ranging
from £500 to £500,000. The
programme is aimed at arts
organisations—professional and
amateur—which have an established
track record and which may have
previously received funding from the
Arts Council, Regional Arts Boards
or local authorities.
• The Arts for Everyone Express
programme is for projects ranging
from £500 to £5,000, and is aimed
primarily at youth or voluntary
groups, or small professional arts
organisations putting together their
first creative project. It has begun to
put small-scale grants in place at
community and neighbourhood level,
fostering local artistic activity in a
way that has an impact on people’s
ordinary lives.
NESTA
The Government proposes to set up a
National Endowment for Science, Technology
and the Arts (NESTA) with funding from the
National Lottery to help talented young
people develop their skills in the creative
industries and in science and technology, and
help turn creativity into products and services
which are effectively exploited with rights
effectively protected.
NESTA, which will be independent of
government, will encompass science,
technology and design, film, broadcasting and
the audio-visual and music industries,
architecture, the arts and information and
communications technology. The
Government believes that NESTA should
place particular emphasis on multimedia and
other areas where the arts and science and
technology meet.
469
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Local Authorities
Local authorities maintain around 1,000 local
museums and art galleries and a network of
over 4,000 public libraries. They also support
many other buildings, organisations and
events for cultural activity in their areas,
providing grant aid for professional and
voluntary bodies, including orchestras,
theatres, and opera and dance companies.
They undertake direct promotions of cultural
activity and contribute to the cost of new or
converted buildings for the sector. In England
net revenue support from local authorities for
1996-97 was around £194.6 million.
The Corporation of London—the local
authority for the City of London—is the third
largest sponsor of culture in Britain (the
largest are the Government and the BBC),
with a budget of £37 million in 1997-98. The
Corporation owns and manages the Barbican
Centre (Europe’s largest multi-arts and
conference centre); is principal patron of the
London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal
Shakespeare Company; and funds and
manages the Guildhall School of Music and
Drama, where over 700 performing arts
students from more than 40 countries are
studying.
Business Sponsorship
Industrial and commercial companies offer
vital sponsorship to a wide range of cultural
activity. The Pairing Scheme for the Arts,
managed by the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA), on behalf of
the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport, aims to encourage businesses in
Britain to sponsor cultural activity. Under
the scheme, government funding of between
£500 and £75,000 is awarded to culture
organisations to complement the sponsorship
from businesses. Launched in 1984, the
scheme has brought over £124 million into
culture (including a government contribution
of over £40 million). In 1997-98 government
funding for the Scheme was £5.05 million.
Under ABSA’s Business in the Arts
programme, the private sector gives part-
time management expertise to arts
organisations.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up in 1991 by the Pool Promoters
Association to channel funds into sport and
the arts. Almost £20 million of the
Foundation’s annual revenue is used to benefit
the arts and is distributed in the form of
awards to a variety of organisations.
The Government Art Collection
The Government Art Collection comprises
over 12,000 works and covers principally
historical, modern and contemporary British
art. It is displayed in 500 government
buildings in Britain and overseas and provides
a showcase for Britain’s creative talent. See
colour plates between pp. 256 and 257 and the
Foreword (p. vii).
Cultural Diversity and Disability
Cultural Diversity
The Arts Council of England and the Regional
Arts Boards support African, Caribbean and
Chinese work as one of their stated priorities
and expect such work to be built into
mainstream provision of arts centres, galleries
and so on. In addition they fund the Asian
Arts Development Agency; the African Asian
Visual Arts Archive; and the British Chinese
Artists Association. Leading companies
receiving support include the African people’s
dance company, Adzido; the theatre group,
Black Mime; the British-Malaysian dance
group, Bi-Ma; and the numerous costume
bands taking part in the annual Netting Hill
Carnival—the largest street festival in Europe.
Arts and Disability
The National Disability Arts Forum and other
national agencies are funded by the Arts
Council of England, as are creative
organisations, such as CandoCo, a company of
disabled and non-disabled dancers. The
Council also supports an apprenticeship
scheme for disabled people in major arts
organisations, such as the Royal Shakespeare
Company, which is part of an initiative aimed
470
THE ARTS
at increasing employment opportunities in the
arts for disabled people.
Other schemes supported by the Arts
Council of England include an audit of deaf
arts conducted by Deafworks and projects
involving disabled artists in schools. The
Scottish Arts Council supports Art Link and
Project Ability, which provide opportunities
for people with disabilities to develop
creativity in a range of art forms.
The provision of access for disabled people
to arts buildings is a basic criterion for all
grants made from the National Lottery. The
Department for Culture, Media and Sport
funds the ADAPT Trust which advises on
and provides funds for improvements in
access (physical or sensory) to a range of
leisure and arts venues.
Arts Centres
Over 200 arts centres in Britain give people
the chance of enjoying and taking part in a
range of activities, with educational projects
becoming increasingly important. Nearly all
arts centres are professionally managed, while
using the services of volunteers. They are
assisted mainly by the Arts Councils, Regional
Arts Boards and local authorities, while the
Arts Council of England funds two national
centres—the South Bank Centre and the
Institute of Contemporary Arts. Many
theatres and art galleries also provide a focal
point for other community arts facilities.
The British Council
The British Council (see p. 140) promotes
British creativity internationally in the arts,
literature and design, and highlights Britain’s
cultural diversity. The Visiting Arts Office of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is a joint
venture of the British Council with the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office, the four
national Arts Councils and the Crafts Council.
It encourages the inward flow to Britain of arts
from other countries.
Broadcasting
BBC radio and television and the independent
companies (see chapter 29) broadcast a variety
of drama, opera, ballet and music, as well as
general arts magazine programmes and
documentaries. These have won many
international awards at festivals such as the
Prix Italia and Montreux International
Television Festivals. Independent television
companies also give grants for arts promotion
in their regions.
Broadcasting is a major medium for making
the arts available to the public and is a crucial
source of work for actors, musicians, writers,
composers, technicians and others in the arts
world. It has created its own forms—nothing
like the arts documentary or drama series, for
instance, exists in any other medium.
Broadcasters commission and produce a vast
quantity of new work. Television and radio
provide critical debate, information and
education about the arts.
The BBC has five orchestras, which
employ many of Britain’s full-time
professional musicians. Each week it
broadcasts about 100 hours of classical and
other music (both live and recorded) on its
Radio 3 (FM 90.2-92.4) channel. BBC Radio
1 (FM 97.6-99.8) broadcasts rock and pop
music, along with a range of other
programming, 24 hours a day, and a large part
of the output of BBC Radio 2 (FM 88.0-90.2 )
is popular and light music. There are at
present two national commercial radio stations
which broadcast music: Classic FM (FM
100-102), which broadcasts mainly classical
music; and Virgin Radio (FM 105.8; MW
1197,1215), which plays broad-based rock
music. Much of the output of Britain’s local
radio stations consists of popular and light
music.
The BBC regularly commissions new
music, particularly by British composers, and
sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals.
Each summer it presents and broadcasts the
BBC Promenade Concerts (the ‘Proms’), the
world’s largest music festival, at the Royal
Albert Hall.
Festivals
Some 650 professional arts festivals take place
in Britain each year. The annual Edinburgh
International Festival, featuring a wide range
of arts, is held in August and September and is
471
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the largest of its kind in the world. Other
festivals held in Edinburgh include the annual
International Jazz Festival, the International
Film and Television Festivals and the annual
Book Festival. Some well-known festivals
concentrating on music are the Three Choirs
Festival, which has taken place annually for
more than 260 years in Gloucester, Worcester
or Hereford; the Cheltenham International
Festival of Music, largely devoted to
contemporary British music; and the
Aldeburgh festival.
Among other festivals catering for a
number of art forms are the Royal National
Eisteddfod of Wales, the Royal National
Gaelic Mod in Scotland, the Belfast Festival at
Queen’s University, and the festivals in
Brighton, Buxton, Chester, St Davids,
Harrogate, Llangollen, Malvern, Perth and
York. Pop music festivals include
Glastonbury, Phoenix (at Stratford-upon-
Avon) and Womad (Reading). Many smaller
towns also hold arts festivals. A major event in
London is the Netting Hill Carnival, which is
organised largely by the Afro-Caribbean
community.
Arts 2000
Arts 2000 is an Arts Council initiative which
celebrates the approach of the millennium.
During each year between 1992 and 2000, one
city, town or region in Britain has been
nominated, through competition, to celebrate

DRAMA
Britain is one of the world’s major centres for
theatre, and has a long and rich dramatic
tradition. There are companies based in
London and in many other cities and towns; in
addition, numerous touring companies visit
theatres, festivals and other venues, including
arts and sports centres and social clubs.
Contemporary British playwrights who
have received international recognition, with
examples of their works, include:
• David Hare: Skylight; Racing Demon;
Amy's View;
• Alan Ayckbourn: The Revengers'
Comedies; A Chorus of Disapproval;
© John Godber: Up 'N Under; On the Piste;
• Caryl Churchill: Serious Money; The
Sbiker; and
• Tom Stoppard: Travesties; Arcadia;
Indian Ink.
Among the best-known directors are Sir
Peter Hall, Richard Eyre, Nicholas Hytner,
Trevor Nunn, Adrian Noble, Jonathan Miller,
Deborah Warner and Terry Hands, while the
many British performers who enjoy
international reputations include Eileen Atkins,
Kenneth Branagh, Dame Judi Dench, Ralph
Fiennes, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness,
Paul Scofield, Sir Ian McKellen, Helen
Mirren, Vanessa Redgrave, Dame Diana Rigg,
Dame Maggie Smith and Juliet Stevenson.
British stage designers such as John Bury,
Ralph Koltai and Carl Toms are internationally
acclaimed.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended for
professional use which can seat between 200
and 2,300 people. Some are privately owned,
but most are owned either municipally or by
non-profit-making organisations. Over 40 of
these have resident theatre companies
receiving subsidies from the Arts Councils and
Regional Arts Boards. In summer there are
also open air theatres, including one in
London’s Regent’s Park and the Minack
Theatre, which is on a clifftop near Land’s
End in Cornwall. Most theatres are
commercially run and self-financing, relying
on popular shows and musicals to be
profitable. By contrast, companies funded by
the Arts Councils tend to offer a variety of
traditional and experimental productions.
Experimental or innovative work is often
staged in ‘fringe theatres’ in London and other
cities; these are smaller theatres which use a
variety of buildings, such as rooms in pubs.

THE ARTS
London
London has about 100 theatres, 15 of them
permanently occupied by subsidised companies.
These include:
• the Royal National Theatre, which stages
a range of modern and classical plays in
its three auditoriums on the South Bank;
• the Royal Shakespeare Company, which
presents plays mainly by Shakespeare
and his contemporaries, as well as some
modern work, has two auditoriums in the
City’s Barbican Centre. The Company’s
main base is in Stratford-upon-Avon; it
also tours other parts of Britain for six
months of the year; and
• the English Stage Company, which
stages the work of many new playwrights.
(Normally sited at the Royal Court
Theatre in Sloane Square, at the time of
writing the company was based at the
Duke of York and Ambassadors theatres
while the Royal Court was being
renovated.)
The largest concentration of London’s
commercial theatres is around Shaftesbury
Avenue. West End theatre attendance was
over 11 million in 1996.
In 1989 the partial remains of the Globe
Theatre, where Shakespeare acted, and the
Rose Theatre, where his plays were performed
during his lifetime, were excavated on the
south bank of the Thames; both have since
been listed as ancient monuments. A modern,

Globe Theatre, near its original site, opened
its first season in 1997.
Regional Theatres
Outside London most cities and many large
towns have at least one theatre. Older theatres
which have been restored include the Theatre
Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne, which dates
from the 18th century; the Alhambra,
Bradford; the Lyceum, Sheffield; the Theatre
Royal, Bristol; and the Grand Opera House,
Belfast, all dating from the 19th century.
Others, such as the West Yorkshire
Playhouse, Leeds, and the Theatre Royal,
Plymouth, have been built to modern designs.
Edinburgh’s rebuilt and restored Empire
Theatre—now the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre—provides an international venue for
large-scale productions. A custom-built
theatre for new writing recently became the
new home of the Traverse Theatre in
Edinburgh. Several universities have theatres
which house professional companies playing
to the public.
Most regional repertory companies mount
about eight to ten productions a year; several
have studio theatres in addition to the main
auditorium, where they present new or
experimental drama and plays of specialist
interest. Repertory theatres also often
function as social centres by offering concerts,
poetry readings and exhibitions, and by
providing restaurants, bars and shops.
Regional theatre companies with major
reputations include the Citizens’ Theatre,
Glasgow; the Royal Exchange, Manchester;
Bristol Old Vic; West Yorkshire Playhouse;
the Festival Theatre, Chichester; and the
Nottingham Playhouse, one of the first
modern regional theatres. Successful
productions from regional theatre companies
often transfer to London’s West End. In
addition, the largest regional theatres receive
visits from the Royal National Theatre or the
Royal Shakespeare Company, which has three
theatres at its base in Stratford-upon-Avon.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Theatre for Young People
The Unicorn Theatre for Children and Polka
Children’s Theatre, both in London, present
plays specially written for children; and the
Whirligig Theatre tours throughout Britain.
The Young Vic Company in London and
Contact Theatre Company in Manchester
stage plays for young people. Numerous
Theatre-in-Education companies perform in
schools. Some of these companies operate
independently—Theatre Centre, for example,
plays in London and tours further afield.
Others are attached to regional repertory
theatres such as the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich,
and Greenwich Theatre. Most regional
repertory theatres also mount productions for
younger audiences, and concessionary ticket
prices are generally available for those at
school, college or university.
There has been a marked growth in youth
theatres, which number more than 500 in
England alone; both the National Youth
Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow offer early acting
opportunities to young people.
Dramatic Training
Training for actors, directors, lighting and
sound technicians and stage managers is
provided mainly in drama schools, among
them the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art
(RADA), the Central School of Speech and
Drama, the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art (LAMDA), and the Drama
Centre (all in London); the Bristol Old Vic
School, the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama (Glasgow) and the Welsh College
of Music and Drama (Cardiff). Theatre design
courses, often based in art schools, are
available for people wanting to train as stage
designers. A number of universities and
colleges offer degree courses in drama.
Amateur Theatre
There are several thousand amateur dramatic
societies throughout Britain. They use a
variety of buildings, including schools and
public halls. Their work is encouraged by a
number of organisations, including the
Central Council for Amateur Theatre, the
National Drama Conference, the Scottish
Community Drama Association and the
Association of Ulster Drama Festivals.
Amateur companies sometimes receive
financial support from local government and
other bodies.
MUSIC
People in Britain are interested in a wide range
of music, from classical to different forms of
rock, country and pop music. Jazz, folk and
world music, and brass bands also have
substantial followings.
Throughout the year Britain’s arts festivals,
many of which have a strong music focus,
attract thousands of people—residents and
tourists alike.
Orchestral and Choral Music
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are
promoted every year in many large towns and
cities. The principal concert halls in central
London are the Royal Festival Hall in the
South Bank Centre, next to which are the
Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room,
which accommodate smaller-scale
performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences in
the City of London); the Royal Albert Hall in
Kensington; the Wigmore Hall, a recital
centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
Birmingham has its own recently built concert
hall, the Symphony Hall, while the 2,400-seat
Bridgewater Hall opened in 1996 for
Manchester’s Halle Orchestra and one of a
similar size opened in Belfast in 1997.
The leading symphony orchestras in
London are the London Symphony, the
Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic, the
Royal Philharmonic and the BBC Symphony.
Important regional orchestras in England
include the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the
Halle, the City of Birmingham Symphony and
the Bournemouth Symphony, while in the
other countries of Britain the leading
orchestras are: the Ulster Orchestra, the Royal
Scottish National Orchestra and the BBC
National Orchestra of Wales. The BBC’s five
orchestras give broadcast concerts which are
474
THE ARTS
often open to the public. There are also
chamber orchestras, such as the City of
London Sinfonia, the Academy of St Martin-
in-the-Fields, the Northern Sinfonia, the
Bournemouth Sinfonietta and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra. Specialised ensembles
include the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment, the English Baroque Soloists
and the English Concert. The London
Sinfonietta and the Birmingham
Contemporary Music Group specialise in
contemporary music.
British conductors such as Sir Colin Davis,
Vernon Handley, Trevor Pinnock, John Eliot
Gardiner, Andrew Davis, Sir Simon Rattle,
Sir Neville Marriner, Christopher Hogwood,
Jane Glover and Richard Hickox reach a wide
audience through their recordings as well as
by their performances. The works of living
composers such as Sir Michael Tippett, Sir
Peter Maxwell Davies and Sir Harrison
Birtwistle enjoy international acclaim. Other
well-established British composers include
Michael Berkeley, John Tavener, Sir Malcolm
Arnold, Oliver Knussen, Nicola le Fanu,
George Lloyd, David Matthews, Mark
Anthony Turnage, John Casken, James
MacMillan and Judith Weir. The Master of
the Queen’s Music, Malcolm Williamson,
holds an office within the Royal Household
with responsibility for organising and writing
music for state occasions. Percussionist Evelyn
Glennie and clarinettist Emma Johnson are
among solo performers currently enjoying
great acclaim.
The principal choral societies include the
Bach Choir, the Royal Choral Society, the
Huddersfield Choral Society, the Cardiff
Polyphonic Choir, the Edinburgh
International Festival Chorus and the Belfast
Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading
orchestras maintain their own choral societies.
The English tradition of ecclesiastical choral
singing is exemplified by choirs such as those
of King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, and
Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, while other
choirs such as the Roman Catholic
Westminster Cathedral choir are also well
known. There are many male-voice choirs in
Wales and in certain parts of England.
The Leeds International Pianoforte
Competition for young pianists is one of the
most prestigious events in the musical
calendar; and the biennial Cardiff Singer of
the World Competition attracts outstanding
young singers from all over the world.
Pop and Rock Music
Hundreds of hours of pop and rock music are
broadcast through BBC and independent
radio stations every week. Television
programmes of both live and recorded music
also feature pop and rock, which is by far the
most popular form of music in Britain. It
covers a diversity of styles, ranging from
dance to heavy metal.
British groups continue to be popular
throughout the world and are often at the
forefront of new developments in music.
Some of the more recent groups include the
Spice Girls, Oasis, Blur, and Manic Street
Preachers. Well-known performers include
George Michael, Gabrielle, Annie Lennox and
Paul Weller. In May 1997 the Spice Girls
became the first British group for 15 years to
top the US charts with a debut album.
Worldwide sales of the album Spice have
exceeded 12 million.
The pop and rock music industry
contributes significantly to Britain’s overseas
earnings through the sale of recordings,
concert tours, and promotional material,
including clothing and books.
Britain’s first National Centre for Popular
Music is being built in Sheffield, with a
National Lottery grant of £11 million. This
interactive arts and education centre,
celebrating the global influence of pop music,
is expected to open in 1998.
Jazz
Jazz has a large and growing following in
Britain and is played in numerous clubs and
pubs, and increasingly in the leading concert
halls. There is also a jazz radio station, Jazz
FM, which broadcasts in London and in the
north west of England. The London Jazz
Festival attracts international stars, such as the
bandleader Django Bates, saxophonists
Pharoah Saunders and Joshua Redman, and
the singer Jean Carn. British musicians such as
Barbara Thompson, Stan Tracey, Julian
475
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Joseph, David Jean Baptiste, Tommy Smith
and Courtney Pine have established
international reputations. Festivals of jazz
music are held throughout Britain, including
Brecon, Cardiff Bay, Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Birmingham, Cheltenham and Bath.
Training
Professional training in music is given at
universities and colleges of music, known as
conservatoires. The leading London
conservatoires are the Royal Academy of
Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and
Trinity College of Music: Outside London
the main conservatoires are the Royal Scottish
Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow,
the Royal Northern College of Music in
Manchester, the Welsh College of Music and
Drama, Cardiff, and the Birmingham
Conservatoire.
The City University’s music industry
course provides training in business practice
aimed specifically at musicians and music
administrators.
Other Educational Schemes
Many children learn to play musical
instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board of the
Royal Schools of Music or Trinity College of
Music. Music is one of the foundation
subjects in the National Curriculum (see
chapter 26), with a focus on creative music
making. The national youth orchestras of
Great Britain, Scotland, Ulster and Wales,
and other youth orchestras have established
high standards. Nearly a third of the players
in the European Community Youth Orchestra
come from Britain. There is also a National
Youth Jazz Orchestra and a network of other
youth jazz orchestras and wind bands around
the country.
Youth and Music, an organisation
affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, offers subsidised tickets for young
people to attend opera, dance and concert
performances.
OPERA
Interest in opera has been growing markedly
in Britain. In a recent survey2 in 1996-97 over
3 million adults said they attended opera
performances. A number of British singers—
Thomas Allen, Anne Evans, Philip Langridge,
Felicity Lott, Felicity Palmer and Bryn
Terfel, for example—have now established
themselves in the international opera houses.
Regular seasons of opera are held at the
Royal Opera House, Co vent Garden, London,
although from July 1997 the Royal Opera
House will be closed for two years for
redevelopment. This is being done with the
help of a National Lottery grant of £78 million,
and during the two-year closure both the Royal
Opera and the Royal Ballet will perform in a
number of alternative venues in London.
English National Opera stages opera in
English at the London Coliseum. Scottish
Opera has regular seasons at the Theatre Royal
in Glasgow, and tours mainly in Scotland and
northern England. Welsh National Opera
presents seasons in Cardiff and tours
extensively in England and Wales. Music
Theatre Wales has become well known for its
contemporary work. Leeds-based Opera North
tours mainly in the north of England and has
gained an international reputation. The
Almeida Opera in London develops much new
work. English Touring Opera takes opera to
towns throughout England. Opera Northern
Ireland presents seasons at the Grand Opera
House, Belfast, and tours the Province.
The National Opera Studio provides
advanced training for young singers, seeking
to bridge the gap between colleges and the
profession.
An opera season for which international
casts are specially assembled is held every
summer at Glyndebourne in East Sussex.
This is followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera, using casts
drawn from the chorus of the festival season.

widening range of professional dance.
Subsidised Dance Companies
Subsidised dance companies include the Royal
Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet, English
National Ballet, Northern Ballet Theatre and
Rambert Dance Company, which rank among
the world’s leading companies and are
supported by professional orchestras.
Birmingham Royal Ballet tours widely in
Britain and overseas; English National Ballet
divides its performances between London and
the regions; Northern Ballet Theatre is based in
Leeds and also tours. Other subsidised
companies include the Cardiff-based
Diversions Dance Company and the Scottish
Dance Theatre.
The Arts Councils also subsidise a wide
range of other companies and dance
organisations, including the Adzido Pan African
Dance Ensemble, Shobana Jeyasingh Dance
Company, Richard Alston Dance Company,
and Dance Umbrella, which promotes an
annual festival of contemporary dance in
London. Matthew Bourne, Christopher Bruce,
Richard Alston, Lloyd Newson, Ashley Page,
Shobana Jeyasingh, Siobhan Davies and
Jonathan Burrows are among the foremost
British choreographers. Leading dancers
include Darcey Bussell, Gill Clarke, Adam
Cooper and Deborah Bull.
National Dance Agencies
A network of eight agencies for professional
and community dancers has been established
across England. The agencies, which receive
Arts Council, Regional Arts Board and local
authority funding, offer classes, provide
information and advice, help to co-ordinate
activities and commission dance artists to
create work.
Training
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by
specialist schools, which include the Royal
Ballet School, the Central School of Ballet, the
Northern School of Contemporary Dance
(Leeds) and the London Contemporary Dance
School; these, with many private schools, have
helped to raise British dance to its present
standard. Dance is a subject for degree studies
at a number of institutions, including the
Laban Centre (University of London), the
University of Surrey, Dartington College of
Arts in Devon and Middlesex University.
Other Educational Schemes
The Arts Council of England runs Taped, a
scheme to finance dance videos for use in
education, while the Video Place provides a
library of videotape documentation of dance
performances for viewing by promoters,
choreographers, dancers, teachers and
students. The Scottish Arts Council supports
Dance Base, which offers a range of classes.
All government-funded dance companies
provide dance workshops and education
activities. Many have won awards for major
projects, such as Phoenix Dance Company’s
‘Urban Exchange’ and English National
Ballet’s ‘Striking a Balance’. Ludus Dance
Company, based in Lancaster, works mainly
with young people.
The National Youth Dance Company
provides opportunities for young dancers to
work with professionals and to create and
perform dance. Similar opportunities exist for
young people to join youth dance companies
throughout the country.
FILMS
The British film industry has recovered from
its doldrums of the early 1980s, and by late
1996 cinema attendances and domestic film
production were at their highest levels for over
20 years. Commercial successes like Four
Weddings and a Funeral, Trainspotting, Mrs
Brown and The Full Monty have helped to
draw attention back to British films, which
also continue to win a large share of awards at
major international festivals and events. In
1996 more than ,£420 million was taken at the
box office.
British films, actors, and producers as well
as the creative and technical services
477
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
supporting them are widely acclaimed. British
performers who enjoy international
reputations include Kenneth Branagh,
Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Ralph Fiennes,
Hugh Grant, Richard E Grant, Sir Anthony
Hopkins, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson,
Miranda Richardson, Alan Rickman, Greta
Scacchi and Emma Thompson. Successful
British directors include Alan Parker, Mike
Newell, Sally Potter, Michael Radford, Ken
Loach, Mike Leigh, whose film Secrets and
Lies won the Palme d’Or at the 1996 Cannes
Film Festival, and Anthony Minghella, who
won the 1997 Oscar for best director with
The English Patient.
There are about 2,200 cinema screens in
Britain, and estimated attendances are
currently running at about 2.5 million a week;
cinema admissions have more than doubled
(to 124 million a year) since 1984. In London
and other large cities a number of art or
repertory cinemas show films which have not
been more widely distributed. These include
films from Britain and abroad; other foreign
films, often with English subtitles; and older
films which are being shown again, sometimes
in a newly edited form.
Animation
The resurgence of interest in animation in
Britain is due in part to the pioneering work of
British animators, who have created 3D
animation and computer animation. British
animations have won six Oscars for Best
Animated Short Film in recent years,
including David Fine and Alison Snowdon’s
Bob’s Birthday in 1995 for Channel 4, Nick
Park’s A Close Shave (his third Oscar), in
1996, and Peter Law’s Wat’s Pig in 1997.
Television has proved an important source of
production finance.
Government Support
Government support for the British film
industry has historically focused on promoting
film as an art form rather than as an industrial
process competing in a highly developed
international market. The new Government
has announced that it will concern itself
increasingly with the economic development
of the industry, helping it to become more
competitive in the international market. In
July 1997 it introduced a 100 per cent tax
write-off on the production and acquisition
costs for British films with budgets of up to
£15 million.
An action plan to boost the film industry
was announced in May 1997. The
Government has set up a film policy review
group consisting of leading figures from the
film industry to formulate an agenda for
action. The group will examine six areas:
• broadening the audience and improving
access to good cinema;
• increasing the market share of British
films;
• developing the skills and talents of those
who wish to work in the audio-visual
industry;
• improving the current financial and fiscal
framework;
• promoting exports of films and
marketing technical skills abroad; and
• assisting the work of the British Film
Commission and the regional and local
commissions (see p. 479) in attracting
inward investment and film-making in
their areas.
The group will aim to double the availability
of British films to British audiences and
encourage the film industry to achieve its
creative and economic potential. A Minister
for Film has been appointed to develop policy.
National Lottery Funding
As in other areas of the arts, the National
Lottery has already made a huge impact on the
film sector. By the end of June 1997, £90.5
million had already been allocated to 209 film-
related projects. An award of £13.8 million
went to the British Film Institute for the
development of its National Film and
Television Archive.
In May 1997 the Arts Council of England,
supported by National Lottery funding of
£92.2 million, awarded three new film
franchises. The production companies, Pathe
Productions, which includes producers
responsible for Gandhi and The Killing Fields,
478
THE ARTS
The Film Consortium, whose producers
worked on Land and Freedom and The Crying
Game, and DNA Film Ltd, formed by
Duncan Kenworthy, the producer of Four
Weddings and a Funeral, and Andrew
MacDonald, the producer of Trainspotting,
will receive funding which is designed to
provide the financial security to plan ahead
and the ability to maximise distribution. The
franchises are expected to produce over 90
British films in the six-year period, with a
possible total investment of £460 million.
Government Sponsorship in 19%
The Government supports a number of
organisations which promote the film
industry. Its largest grants go to the British
Film Institute (see below) and to Scottish
Screen (see p. 480). Major grants go to three
other organisations:
The British Film Commission (BFC),
launched in 1991, markets the British film and
television production service industry to
overseas production executives in order to
attract inward investment. Productions helped
by the BFC have contributed over £300
million to the British production industry and
the British economy. (Government grant in
1996: £800,000.) Productions supported by
the BFC include Mission: Impossible', 101
Dalmations; Saving Private Ryan, and the
forthcoming New Star Wars.
The BFC also works alongside the UK
Film Commission Network, which currently
Comprises 24 area or city offices. The growth
of this network over the past five years
illustrates both the increase in production in
Britain and the recognition by local and
central government of the effectiveness of
such organisations in stimulating increased
production.
In 1996 the BFC helped to set up the London
Film Commission, while the Northern Ireland
Film Commission was launched in April 1997 as
the successor to the Northern Ireland Film
Council.
British Screen Finance, a private sector
company, provides loan finance for new film¬
makers with commercially viable productions
who have difficulty in attracting funding. Loans
are for the production of low- and medium-
budget films involving largely British talent.
Total investment to date on 120 films is £45.5
million. (Government grant in 1996: £2 million.)
Successful films supported by British Screen
Finance include The Crying Game and Orlando.
The European Co-Production Fund
offers loans of up to 30 per cent of a film’s
budget, enabling British producers to
collaborate in the making of films in Europe.
It has invested more than £13.2 million in 41
feature films, with a total value of more than
£110.5 million. (Government grant in 1996:
£2 million.) Successful films include the
Oscar-winning Antonia’s Line and Damage.
Reflecting its support for the trend of
international co-productions, Britain has
seven official bilateral co-production
agreements (with Australia, Canada. France,
Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Norway),
and has ratified the Council of Europe
Convention on Cinematographic Co-
Production, which fosters further
opportunities for European co-production.
British Film Institute
The development of film, video and television
as art forms is promoted by the British Film
Institute (BFI) and in Scotland by Scottish
Screen.
The BFI runs the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film and Television
Archive, which contains over 350,000 films and
television programmes, including newsreels,
animation, feature and short films dating from
1894. The BFI also has the world’s largest
library of information on film and television,
holding extensive international collections of
books, periodicals, scripts, stills and posters.
The BFI’s activities on the South Bank
comprise: the Museum of the Moving Image,
which traces the history of film and television;
the London IMAX cinema (see below); and the
National Film Theatre. The last named has
three cinemas showing films of historical,
artistic or technical interest, and is unique in
offering regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations. In 1996—97 about
2,000 films, television and video programmes
were shown, attracting attendances of over
209,000. In November each year the BFI hosts
the London Film Festival at the National
479
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Film Theatre and in London’s West End, at
which some 250 new films from all over the
world are screened. In 1996 over 107,000
people attended Festival screenings.
Building is in progress on the nine-storey
London IMAX cinema, which will contain a
500-seat auditorium housing a seven-storey
screen, making it the largest screen in Europe.
The BFI supports a network of regional
film theatres across Britain, and gives grants
to arts, media and film organisations through
the Regional Arts Boards (see p. 468).
Scottish Screen
Scottish Screen was set up in April 1997,
bringing together the functions of four
existing film agencies: the Scottish Film
Council, previously responsible for
supporting regional film theatres, promoting
and providing material for media education
and administering the Scottish Film Archive;
the Scottish Film Production Fund, offering
financial assistance to develop film scripts;
Scottish Screen Locations, providing advice
to film-makers on suitable locations for film
productions in Scotland; and Scottish
Broadcast and Film Training. The new
organisation has been restructured to take on
an increased emphasis on production.
Children’s Film
The Children’s Film and Television
Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films for children, shown
largely through video and television.
The Children’s Film Unit makes feature
films for children (mainly for Channel 4) and
runs weekly workshops for children on all
aspects of film-making. The Unit caters for
about 80 children at any time and has
produced 15 feature films.
The Northern Ireland Film Council runs
Cinemagic, an award-winning international
film festival for young people.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School is
financed jointly by the Government and by
the film, video and television industries. It
offers postgraduate and short course training
for directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. The School
enrols about 30 full-time students a year and
about 500 on short course programmes. In
1996-97 it received a government grant of
£1.9 million. The School is planning to move
from its present location in Buckinghamshire
to the former BBC film studios in west
London in 2000.
The London International Film School, the
Royal College of Art, and some universities
and other institutions of higher education also
offer courses in film production.
Cinema Licensing and Film Classification
Cinemas showing films to the public must be
licensed by local authorities, which have a legal
duty to prohibit the admission of children to
unsuitable films, and may prevent the showing
of any film. In assessing films the authorities
normally rely on the judgment of an
independent non-statutory body, the British
Board of Film Classification (BBFC), to which
all films must be submitted. The Board was set
up on the initiative of the cinema industry to
ensure a proper standard in films shown to the
public. It does not use any written code of
censorship, but can require cuts to be made
before granting a certificate; on rare occasions,
it refuses a certificate.
Films passed by the Board are put into one
of the following categories:
• U (universal)—suitable for all;
• PG (parental guidance), in which some
scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at premises to which no one under 18 is
admitted—for example, licensed cinema
clubs.
Videos
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to

commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of its
classification—for example, to sell or hire a
video classified 18 to a person under 18.
MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES
About 110 million people a year, across all
social groups, visit more than 2,500 museums
and galleries open to the public, which include
the major national collections, around 1,100
independent museums, and museums
receiving support from local authorities.
Museums and galleries in Britain receive
about £440 million a year in public
expenditure. All national museums and
galleries are financed chiefly from government
funds; they may charge for entry to their
permanent collections and special exhibitions.
Most of the national collections are managed
by independent trustees.
Museums and galleries maintained by local
authorities, universities, independent
museums and private funds may receive help
in building up their collections through grants
administered by the Museums and Galleries
Commission (see below) and the museum
councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. Support to national and regional
public and independent museums and
galleries is also given by the Arts Councils and
by trusts and voluntary bodies, including the
Henry Moore Foundation, the Calouste
Gulbenkian Foundation and the National Art
Collections Fund.
The Museums and Galleries Commission
promotes co-operation between national and
regional museums and galleries and provides
funds to the seven area museum councils,
which supply a variety of services, advice, and
their own small grants to individual museums.
Many National Lottery (see chapter 6)
awards are being used to improve the
infrastructure of the museums and galleries
sector. By July 1997, 222 awards totalling
more than £404 million had been granted in
support of museum and gallery projects.
Museum goers are already beginning to
benefit: the first phase of the new Earth
Galleries opened at the Natural History
Museum in July 1996, and the Imperial War
Museum’s new American Air Museum at
Duxford, Cambridgeshire, opened in August
1997.
The Museums and Galleries Commission
administers a system whereby pre-eminent
works of art may be accepted by the
Government in settlement of inheritance tax
and allocated to public galleries; items
accepted in 1996—97 include: a Queen Anne
longcase clock by Daniel Quare; furniture and
lamps by Giacometti; and three 18th-century
watercolours by Thomas Girtin.
The Government encourages the loan of
objects from national and regional collections
so that works of art can be seen by as wide a
public as possible. The Arts Council of
England is also broadening access to the
national collections, through a National
Collections Touring Scheme and the National
Touring Exhibition Service.
British artists, photographers, architects
and sculptors with international reputations
include David Hockney, Lucian Freud,
Howard Hodgkin, David Bailey, Jane Bown,
Sir Richard Rogers, Sir Anthony Caro and
Phillip King. Younger artists with a similar
standing include Richard Deacon, Tony
Cragg, Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread and
Anish Kapoor. The work of these artists is
shown in the independent galleries funded by
the Arts Council of England: the Arnolfini in
Bristol; the Ikon, Birmingham; the Museum
of Modern Art, Oxford; and the Serpentine,
London.
A review of museums policy in England,
Treasures in Trust, was published in 1996. This
provided a new framework for museums, with
increased emphasis on care of collections,
public participation and quality of service. It
proposed that up to 30 non-national museums
be designated as holding pre-eminent
collections. Its recommendations are now
being implemented. In June 1997 the new
Government announced that 26 museums
were so designated. They range from the
National Tramway Museum in Derbyshire to
the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. A further
20 museums will be designated in 1998.
Overall 1995-96 saw a further increase in
the number of visits to the national museums
and galleries in England (see Table 28.2).
481
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Independent Museums Association, to
which many museums and art galleries and
their staffs belong, facilitates exchange of
information and discussion of matters relating
to museums and galleries. The Association,
which has many overseas members, provides
training, seminars and research; its
publications include the monthly Museums
Journal and a new technical periodical,
Museum Practice.
The Museum Training Institute is
responsible for developing training standards
and programmes within museums.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries, many
of them located in London, contain some of
the world’s most comprehensive collections of
objects of artistic, archaeological, scientific,
historical and general interest. The English
national museums are:
• the British Museum (including the
ethnographic collections of the Museum
of Mankind);
• the Natural History Museum;
• the Victoria and Albert Museum (the
V&A, which displays fine and decorative
arts);
• the National Museum of Science and
Industry, including the Science Museum
and its two regional institutes—the
National Railway Museum (York) and
the National Museum of Photography,
Film and Television (Bradford);
• the National Gallery (which houses
western painting from around 1260 to
1900);
• the Tate Gallery, with collections in
London (British painting and modern
art), Liverpool and St Ives (St Ives
School and contemporary art);
• the National Portrait Gallery;
• the Imperial War Museum;
• the Royal Armouries;
• the National Army Museum;
• the Royal Air Force Museum;
• the National Maritime Museum;
• the Wallace Collection (which includes
paintings, furniture, arms and armour,
and objets d’art); and
• the National Museums and Galleries on
Merseyside.
The Royal Armouries, Britain’s oldest
museum, has collections in the Tower of
London (items relating to the Tower’s
history), Leeds (arms and armoury) and Fort

THE ARTS
Nelson, near Portsmouth (artillery). The Tate
Gallery is to create Britain’s first national
museum of modern art, situated on the south
bank of the Thames. Awarded £50 million by
the Millennium Commission, the new
museum will house a collection of 20th-
century art of international importance and is
expected to open in 2000. The Imperial War
Museum, which has three sites in London
and one in Cambridgeshire, plans to open a
branch on the banks of the Manchester Ship
Canal. The new museum will concentrate on
social history since 1914 and is expected to
open by 2002.
In Scotland the national collections are
held by the National Museums of Scotland
and the National Galleries of Scotland. The
former include the Royal Museum of
Scotland, the Scottish United Services
Museum and the Scottish Agricultural
Museum, in Edinburgh; the Museum of
Flight, near North Berwick; and the Museum
of Costume at Shambellie House near
Dumfries. A new Museum of Scotland is
being built next to the Royal Museum to
house the National Museums’ Scottish
collection.
The National Galleries of Scotland
comprise the National Gallery of Scotland,
the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.
The National Galleries of Scotland also have
collections at Paxton House near Berwick and
Duff House in Banff.
In 1996-97 the National Museums of
Scotland attracted 1.5 million visitors, and the
National Galleries of Scotland some 1.6
million.
The National Museum of Wales, which
has opened new galleries at its main building
in Cardiff, has a number of branches,
including the Museum of Welsh Life at St
Fagans, the Welsh Slate Museum at Llanberis
and the Industrial and Maritime Museum in
Cardiff s Bay development.
From April 1998 Northern Ireland’s three
major museums—the Ulster Museum in
Belfast; the Ulster Folk and Transport
Museum in County Down; and the Ulster-
American Folk Park in County Tyrone—will
merge to form the National Museums of
Northern Ireland.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London
include the Museum of London; Sir John
Soane’s Museum; the Courtauld Institute
Galleries; and the London Transport
Museum. The Queen’s Gallery in
Buckingham Palace has exhibitions of pictures
from the extensive royal collection.
Most cities and towns have museums
devoted to art, archaeology and natural and
local history, often administered by the local
authorities but sometimes by local learned
societies or by individuals or trustees. Many
are associated with their universities, such as
the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the
Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
Many collections of art and antiques in
historic family houses, including those owned
by the two National Trusts (see p. 368) and
English Heritage (see p. 367), are open to the
public.
There are also a number of national art
exhibiting societies, the most famous being the
Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington House
in London. The Academy holds an annual
Summer Exhibition and other important
exhibitions during the rest of the year. The
Summer Exhibition is the world’s largest open
contemporary art exhibition and brings
together a wide range of work by established
artists and by others exhibiting for the first
time. The Royal Scottish Academy holds
annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There are
also children’s exhibitions, including the
National Exhibition of Children’s Art. The
Arts Council of England funds the National
Touring Exhibitions Service organised by the
Hayward Gallery, London, which draws on
the Arts Council’s major loan collection of
modern and contemporary British art.
An increasing number of open air museums
depict the regional life of an area or preserve
early industrial remains. These include the
Weald and Downland Museum in West
Sussex, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in
Shropshire. Skills of the past are revived in a
number of‘living’ museums, such as the
Gladstone Pottery Museum near Stoke-on-
Trent and the Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in
Cheshire.
The Burrell Collection in Glasgow houses
world-famous tapestries, paintings and objets

d’art. The Design Museum in London’s
Docklands contains a collection of 20th-
century mass-produced consumer objects.
Crafts
The crafts in Britain have an annual turnover
estimated at £400 million. Government aid for
the crafts, amounting to £3.2 million in
1997-98, is administered in England and
Wales by the Crafts Council. The Council
supports craftspeople by promoting public
interest in their work, and encouraging the
creation of works of contemporary
craftsmanship. Grants are available to help
with setting up workshops and acquiring
equipment. The Crafts Council runs the
National Centre for Crafts in London,
organises the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair, and
co-ordinates British groups at international
trade fairs. Crafts Council exhibitions tour
nationally and internationally, and grants are
made to encourage exhibitions, projects and
organisations. The Council has an Education
Unit, which runs lectures, seminars and
workshops for students, teachers and the public
and provides research in crafts education. It
also runs a bi-monthly magazine, Crafts.
Craftworks, an independent company, is
the crafts development agency for Northern
Ireland, providing training, marketing and
business counselling for the crafts sector. The
Arts Council of Northern Ireland also funds
crafts promotion, as does the Scottish Office
through the Scottish Arts Council.
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in the art colleges and fine and
applied art departments of universities (these
include the Slade School of Art and
Goldsmith’s College of Art, London); and in
further education colleges and private art
schools. Many of these institutions award
degrees at postgraduate level. Art is also
taught at an advanced level at the four
Scottish Central (Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities concentrate largely
on academic disciplines, such as the history
of art. The leading institutions include the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department
of Classical Art and Archaeology at
University College London. The Open
University also offers courses in art history
and theory of art. Art is one of the
foundation subjects in the National
Curriculum. The Society for Education
through Art encourages, among other
activities, the purchase by schools of original
works of art by organising an annual Pictures
for Schools exhibition.
The Open College of the Arts offers
correspondence courses in art and design,
painting, sculpture, textiles, photography
and creative writing to people wishing to
study at home.
Export Control of Works of Art
London is a major centre for the
international art market, and sales of works
of art take place in the main auction houses
(two of the longest established being
Sotheby’s and Christie’s), and through
private dealers. Certain items are covered by
export control; guidance is provided by the
Export Licensing Unit of the Department
for Culture, Media and Sport. A licence is
required before such items can be exported,
and if the Department’s advisers object to
the granting of a licence, the matter is
referred to the Reviewing Committee on the
Export of Works of Art. If the Committee
considers a work to be of national
importance, it can advise the Government to
defer a decision on the licence application for
a specified time to provide an opportunity
for an offer to be made to buy at or above the
recommended fair market price.
Objects saved for the nation in 1997
include: a 17th century painting, Cup of
Water and a Rose by Zurbaran, acquired by
the National Gallery; a Neolithic stone ball
acquired by Aberdeen Museum; and an
18th-century gold box by G.M. Moser
acquired by the Royal Museum of Scotland.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
English literature is taught extensively at
schools, colleges and universities throughout
484
THE ARTS
Britain. Creative writing is also taught at a
variety of institutions, one of the best known
being the University of East Anglia, in
Norwich. The University also houses the
British Centre for Literary Translation. There
are free public libraries throughout Britain
(see p. 486), private libraries and several
private literary societies.
Outstanding literary merit is recognised by
a number of awards, some of the most valuable
being the Booker and Whitbread prizes. The
David Cohen British Literature Prize for a
lifetime’s achievement by a living writer was
won by Muriel Spark in 1997. A part of the
£40,000 prize, which is awarded every two
years, enables winners to commission new
works from younger writers. Other awards to
encourage young authors include those of the
Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E.C.
Gregory Trust Fund.
Ulster-born poet Seamus Heaney was
awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1995. Other distinguished contemporary
British poets include Ted Hughes (the Poet
Laureate), James Berry, Gillian Clarke, Carol
Ann Duffy, U.A. Fanthorpe, Tony Harrison,
Geoffrey Hill, Elizabeth Jennings, R.S.
Thomas and Carol Rumens. As the Poet
Laureate, Ted Hughes is a member of the
Royal Household and receives an annual
stipend from the Civil List (see p. 55).
Many British writers are internationally
recognised. Well-known living novelists, with
examples of their works, include:
• Martin Amis: London Fields', Money; The
Information;
• A.S. Byatt: Still Life; Possession: A
Romance; Babel Tower;
• Julian Barnes: Flaubert's Parrot; Love,
Etc.; Cross Channel;
• Kazuo Ishiguro: An Artist of the Floating
World; The Remains of the Day; The
Unconsoled; and
• Ruth Rendell: Crocodile Bird; Demon in
my View; Simisola.
Many writers from overseas, often from
Commonwealth countries, live and work in
Britain, writing books in English which have a
wide circulation in Britain and overseas.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary works (including computer
programs and databases), and dramatic,
musical or artistic works, films, sound
recordings and broadcasts are automatically
protected by copyright in Britain. This
protection is also given to works from
countries party to international copyright
conventions. The copyright owner has rights
against unauthorised reproduction, public
performance, broadcasting and issue to the
public of his or her work; and against dealing
in unauthorised copies. In most cases the
author is the first owner of the copyright, and
the term of copyright in literary, dramatic,
musical and artistic works is the life of the
author and a period of 70 years after death.
For films the term is 70 years from the last
death among the following: principal
director, authors of the screenplay and
dialogue, or composer of music for the film.
Sound recordings are protected for 50 years
from the year of making or release, and
broadcasts for 50 years from the year of
broadcast.
Performers are also given automatic
protection against broadcasting and recording
of live performances, and reproduction of
recordings. This lasts for 50 years from the
year of performance or release of a recording
of it. A new right against the extraction and
re-utilisation of the contents of a database is
to be introduced from 1 January 1998.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association and the Royal Society
of Literature. The leading society for studies
in the humanities is the British Academy for
the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and
Philological Studies (the British Academy).
Other specialist groups are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several others devoted to
particular authors, the largest of which is the
Dickens Fellowship. Various societies, such as
the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry readings
and recitals. London’s South Bank Centre
runs a programme of literary events.
485
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Libraries
Public Libraries
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service. There are 5,000
public libraries in Britain, nearly 700 libraries
in higher and further education and over 3,000
specialised libraries in other organisations, as
well as three national libraries (see p. 487).
Altogether these employ some 42,500 people.
A further 1,400 are employed in schools and
18,000 in the provision of electronic
information. In England about 60 per cent of
adults are members of their local library and
about half of these borrow a least once a
month.
The services that public libraries and the
British Library supply provide important
support to a range of business interests, from
multi-national companies to individual
entrepreneurs. Public libraries also offer
individuals the opportunity to acquire new
skills and knowledge, and by working with
organisations such as TECs (see chapter 12,
p. 175) can play an important part in the
labour market.
Many libraries have collections of compact
discs, records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local
history, and nearly all provide children’s
departments, while reference and information
sections and art, music, commercial and
technical departments meet a growing
demand. The information role is one of
increasing importance for many libraries, and
greater use is being made of information
technology, including personal computers,
CD-ROMs and reference databases.
The new Government has reaffirmed its
commitment to the principle of public
libraries providing free access to core services
such as book lending and reference. In its
review of the distribution of National Lottery
proceeds (see chapter 6), it will examine the
case for supporting activity in libraries as part
of its policy to refocus the Lottery so that
more people can feel its benefits. One of its
first initiatives under the Lottery’s New
Opportunities Fund includes training and
support for some 10,000 librarians in the
effective use of information and
communications technology.
The Government is advised by the Library
and Information Commission, which is a forum
for policy on library and information provision
in general, and the Advisory Council on
Libraries, which advises on public libraries in
England. In June 1997 the new Government
announced that the Commission’s Working
Group on Information Technology, established
by the previous administration, would continue
to report on how public libraries can respond
effectively to the challenge of new information
and communication technology.
A new challenge fund to develop library
services has been set up: the Public Libraries
Challenge Fund, run by the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport and the Wolfson
Foundation, will provide £6 million in
1997-98—£2 million from the Government
and £1 million from the Wolfson Foundation,
to be matched by a further £3 million from
library authorities. Projects in the following
categories are eligible for support:
• the development and application of
information technology;
• the improvement of reference sections; and
• the renovation and refurbishment of
library buildings.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information services. Founded in
1877, the Association has 26,000 members. It
maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians
and publishes books, pamphlets and an official
journal.
The Library Association is the designated
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other EU member states.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors the right to receive payment
486
THE ARTS
from a central fund (totalling £4.9 million in
1997-98) for the loans made of their books
from public libraries in Britain. Payment is
made in proportion to the number of times the
authors’ books are lent out. The maximum
payment an author can receive is £6,000.
The British Library
The British Library, the national library of
Britain, is one of the world’s greatest libraries,
with a collection of more than 150 million
separate items. These include books, journals,
manuscripts, newspapers, stamps, maps and
recorded sound. British publishers should
deposit a copy of most of their output at the
Library.
The Library’s collection grows by about
two shelf miles a year and consists of bequests,
donations and purchases collected over a
period of more than 200 years. It is also the
guardian of treasures such as the Magna Carta
and Shakespeare’s First Folio. Some 450,000
reader visits are made to the Library each
year. Some of the Library’s reading rooms are
open to all without formality; others are open
to those who need to see material not readily
available elsewhere or whose work or studies
require the facilities of the national library;
access to all reading rooms is free.
The Library’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within Britain
and between Britain and countries overseas. It
dispatches over 4 million documents a year.
The Research and Information Centre, based
in London, is a major source of funding for
research and development in library and
information services.
A new building for the British Library has
been constructed at St Pancras, London, at a
cost of £511 million. The St Pancras building
will offer, for the first time, a purpose-built
home for Britain’s national library with
environmentally controlled storage, increased
reader space and seating, and greatly
improved public facilities, including three
exhibition galleries, an auditorium and a
bookshop. The Humanities Reading Room,
the largest, will open in November 1997.
Other reading rooms will open during 1998
and early 1999.
Other Libraries
The National Libraries of Scotland and
Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford
University and the Cambridge University
Library can also claim copies of all new British
publications under legal deposit. At the
National Library of Scotland the second phase
of a new building, accommodating a map
library, lending services and the Scottish
Science Library, was opened in May 1995. A
major extension of the National Library of
Wales was completed in the same year.
University and other Non-public Libraries
As well as public and national libraries there
are over 600 libraries in higher and further
education, about 5,600 school libraries and
2,220 specialised libraries within other public
and private sector organisations (for example
companies with research facilities and
government departments).
The university libraries of Oxford and
Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations. However, the
combined library resources of the colleges and
institutions of the University of London total
9 million volumes, the John Rylands
University Library of Manchester contains 3.5
million volumes, Edinburgh 2.5 million,
Leeds 2.3 million, and Birmingham, Glasgow,
Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over 1
million volumes. Many universities have
important research collections in special
subjects—the Barnes Medical Library at
Birmingham and the British Library of
Political and Economic Science at the London
School of Economics, for example.
Besides a number of great private
collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the libraries of the learned
societies and institutions, such as the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, the Royal
Geographical Society and the Royal Academy
of Music. The Poetry Library in the South
Bank Centre, owned by the Arts Council of
England, is a collection of 20th-century poetry
written in or translated into English; the
library houses about 60,000 volumes.
The Public Record Office in London and
in Kew, Surrey, houses the records of the
487
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
superior courts of law of England and Wales
and of most government departments, as well
as famous historical documents. The Office
has many millions of documents, dating from
the time of the Norman Conquest to the
present day. Public records, with a few
exceptions, are available for inspection by
members of the public 30 years after the end
of the year in which they were created. The
Scottish Record Office in Edinburgh and the
Public Record Office of Northern Ireland,
Belfast, serve the same purpose.
Books
In 1996 British publishers issued about
100,000 separate titles. The British publishing
industry devotes much effort to developing
overseas markets, and in 1996 the estimated
value of exports of British books amounted to
over ;£ 1 > 100 million.
Among the leading organisations
representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association, which
has 200 members; and the Booksellers
Association, with 3,300 members. The
Publishers Association, through its
International Division, promotes the export
of British books. The Welsh Book Council
supports the production of books in the
Welsh language. The Book Trust encourages
reading and the promotion of books through
an information service and a children’s
library.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts locates, reports on, and gives
information and advice about historical papers
outside the public records. It also advises
private owners, grant-awarding bodies, record
offices, local authorities and the Government
on the acquisition and maintenance of
manuscripts. The Commission maintains the
National Register of Archives (the central
collecting point for information about British
historical manuscripts) and the Manorial
Documents Register, which are available to
researchers.

The media play a central role in daily life in Britain, informing and educating,
questioning and challenging—and, of course, entertaining. Over 97 per cent of
British households have at least one television set. People spend an average of 25
hours a week watching television and over 16 hours listening to the radio.
Britain’s newspapers and magazines, at national, regional and local level, offer
readers greater diversity of content than in probably any other country in Europe.
Television and Radio
Broadcasting in Britain has traditionally been
based on the principle that it is a public
service accountable to the people. While
retaining the essential public service element,
it now also embraces the principles of
competition and choice.
Three public bodies have the main
responsibility for television and radio services.
These authorities work to broad requirements
and objectives defined or endorsed by
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
their day-to-day conduct of business. They are:
• the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation), which broadcasts television
and radio programmes;
• the ITC (Independent Television
Commission), which licenses and
regulates commercial television services
including cable and satellite services,
whether delivered by digital or analogue
technology; and
• the Radio Authority, which licenses and
regulates commercial radio services,
including cable and satellite.
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS—which changed its name
from the Department of National Heritage in
July 1997) is responsible for overseeing the
broadcasting system as a whole; the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport is answerable to Parliament on broad
policy questions.
Television
There are currently five terrestrial television
channels offering a mixture of drama, light
entertainment, films, sport, educational,
children’s and religious programmes, news
and current affairs, and documentaries. The
BBC provides two national networks which
are financed almost wholly by a licence fee
(see p. 492), while the ITC licenses and
regulates three commercial terrestrial
television services—ITV (Channel 3),
489
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Channel 4 and Channel 5—which are funded
by advertising and sponsorship. In Wales,
S4C (Sianel Pedwar Cymru) broadcasts
programmes on the fourth channel.
Satellite television and cable services, also
licensed and regulated by the ITC, account for
over 11 per cent of total viewing. Their main
source of funding is subscription income.
Radio
In recent years there has been a proliferation
of local and national radio stations. The BBC
has five national networks, which together
transmit all types of music, news, current
affairs, drama, education, sport and a range of
features programmes. There are three national
commercial radio stations (see p. 496).
There are 38 BBC local radio stations
serving England and the Channel Islands, and
national regional radio services in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland, including Welsh
and Gaelic language stations. About 200
independent local radio (ILR) services are also
in operation. Stations supply local news and
information, sport, music and other
entertainment, education and consumer advice.
CHANGES IN REGULATION
Broadcasting in Britain has been undergoing
radical change. The availability of more radio
frequencies, together with satellite, cable and
microwave transmissions, has already made a
greater number of local, national and
international services possible. The transition
from analogue to digital transmission
technology has the potential to expand this
capacity enormously. Digital broadcasting is a
new, more effective way of transmitting radio
and television services. It allows much more
information than before to be transmitted, and
can offer many more channels, extra services,
interactivity and higher quality picture and
sound to viewers and listeners willing to invest
in new receiving equipment.
Broadcasting Act 1996
In recognition of this potential, the
Government passed legislation in 1996 setting
out a flexible regulatory framework for the
introduction of digital terrestrial broadcasting
and paving the way for more broadly-based
competitive media groups. There were four
key objectives:
• to safeguard plurality of media ownership
and diversity of viewpoint;
• to preserve Britain’s unique tradition of
public service broadcasting;
• to support the competitiveness of the
British broadcasting industry and give
Britain the opportunity to lead the
world in the exploitation of digital
technology; and
• to ensure broadcasters maintain
appropriate standards of impartiality,
taste and decency.
Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting
The 1996 Act provides for:
• the licensing of at least 18 national digital
terrestrial television channels,
transmitted on six frequency channels or
‘multiplexes’,1 and serving, in the
medium term, from 60 to over 90 per
cent of the population; and
• the licensing of at least 12 digital radio
services on two national multiplexes,
with at least one multiplex available for
local services in most areas of Britain, and
an additional multiplex for extra local
services in areas of greatest demand.
The Act guarantees capacity on three of the
six digital television multiplexes and on one
national radio multiplex for the existing public
service broadcasters. This is to enable them to
improve their services in the digital age and
ensure that British broadcasting maintains its
current standards of programming. The ITC
and Radio Authority are both required to
award national multiplex licences to those
'Through the process known as multiplexing, the signals of several
broadcasters are combined into a single stream on a single¬
frequency channel. There is therefore no longer a direct one-to-
one relationship between a television service and a frequency. The
signals are finally received and decoded by digital receivers or set¬
top boxes attached to existing television sets.
490
THE MEDIA
applicants whose plans will best promote the
development of digital broadcasting—by
installing the new transmission network as
quickly as possible, making consumer receiver
equipment as affordable as possible, and
broadening consumer choice of
programming.2
The Government will review the take-up of
digital receivers within five years into the first
multiplex licence period, and at that point will
determine whether it can set a date for
switching off analogue television frequencies.
Many of the new services on digital
television will be available on a subscription or
pay-per-view basis. Any broadcaster wishing
to offer pay-television needs to use a
‘conditional access’ system (covering
encryption, scrambling and subscription
management services) to ensure that only
those who have paid for a particular service
receive that service. Since any dominant
provider of such systems would have the
power to determine who can, or cannot, enter
the pay-television market, it is important that
providers are subject to effective regulation.
The Government has implemented European
Union regulations to ensure that all
broadcasters can gain access on ‘fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms’ to
any digital set-top boxes which can receive
their signal. OFTEL (see p. 321) has powers
to intervene over anti-competitive behaviour.
Media Ownership
Legislation in 1990 laid down rules enabling
the ITC and Radio Authority to keep
ownership of the broadcasting media widely
spread and to prevent undue concentrations of
single and cross-media ownership, in the
wider public interest. A government review of
ownership regulation issued in 1995
concluded that there was a continuing case for
specific regulations beyond those which are
applied by the general competition law. It said
that the existing rules needed to be relaxed,
both within and across different media sectors;
this would reflect the needs and aspirations of
licences to operate commercial digital television multiplexes were
awarded by the ITC in June and July 1997. The Radio Authority
will advertise commercial radio multiplex licences in 1998.
the industry against the background of
accelerating technological change. Following on
from those recommendations, the 1996 Act:
• allows greater cross-ownership between
newspaper groups, television companies
and radio stations, at both national and
regional levels; and
• introduces ‘public interest’ criteria by
which the regulatory authorities can
assess and approve (or disallow) mergers
or acquisitions between newspapers and
television and radio companies.
The legislation removes the two-licence
limit on the control of ITV (Channel 3)
licences, replacing it by a television ownership
limit of 15 per cent share of the total television
audience. It also allows local newspapers with
more than a 50 per cent share of their market
to own a local radio station, providing at least
one other independent local radio station is
operating in that area.
Other Measures
The Act also introduced a number of other
significant measures including:
• a new restricted television service licence,
which allows specialist and community
broadcasters to provide a service for a
particular event or local area;
• provisions which prevent certain sporting
events being shown exclusively on pay-
per-view or subscription television
without prior consent of the ITC;
• new power for the ITC to.protect
regional programming in the event of a
merger or acquisition of an ITV
(Channel 3) licence; and
• the creation of the Broadcasting
Standards Commission (see p. 498).
THE BBC
A Royal Charter and Agreement govern the
constitution, finances and obligations of the
BBC. The Corporation’s Board of Governors,
including the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and a
National Governor each for Scotland, Wales
491
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and Northern Ireland, is appointed by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. The
Board of Governors is ultimately responsible
for all aspects of broadcasting by the BBC.
The Governors appoint the Director-General,
the Corporation’s chief executive officer who
heads the Executive Committee and Board of
Management—the bodies in charge of the
daily running of the Corporation.
The BBC has a regional structure
throughout Britain. The three English
regions—BBC North, BBC Midlands & East
and BBC South—and BBC Scotland, BBC
Wales and BBC Northern Ireland make
programmes for their local audiences as well as
contributing to the national network.
The National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland advise
on the policy and content of television and
radio programmes intended mainly for
reception in their areas. Ten Regional Councils
in England advise the Board of Governors on
the needs and concerns of audiences.
BBC Charter and Agreement
In 1996 a new Royal Charter came into effect,
enabling the BBC to continue as Britain’s
main public service broadcaster until 2006.
The new Agreement between the BBC and
the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, which runs concurrently with the
Charter, formally establishes the
Corporation’s editorial independence in all
matters of programme content, scheduling
and management. It also provides for the
licence fee to remain the chief source of
finance for the BBC’s public service activities
until at least 2002.
The new Charter and Agreement maintain
the BBC’s essential characteristics as a public
corporation; preserve its primary objectives of
providing broadcasting services of
information, education and entertainment;
and reinforce the duties placed on the
Governors to maintain programme standards
and to ensure the Corporation’s accountability
to its audiences. They also allow for the
development of the BBC’s commercial
activities, in partnership with the private
sector, in Britain and abroad (although these
must be funded, operated and accounted for
separately from its licence-fee-funded
services).
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are financed
predominantly by a licence fee. All households
or premises with a television set must buy an
annual licence (costing £91.50 for colour and
£30.50 for black and white in 1997-98).
Licence income is supplemented by profits
from BBC Worldwide commercial activities
(see p. 499), such as television programme
exports, sale of recordings, publications and
other merchandise connected with BBC
programmes, hire and sale of educational
films, film library sales, and exhibitions based
on programmes. The BBC World Service’s
radio broadcasting operations are financed by
a grant-in-aid from the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office, while BBC Worldwide
Television is self-financing.
In early 1997 the BBC’s transmission
network was privatised, providing new funds
for investment in digital television.
Reorganisation
In 1996 the BBC announced a radical
reorganisation of its management structure in
order to strengthen its existing channels and
services and develop additional digital services
for the licence-fee payer. The changes involve
the separation of broadcasting (scheduling and
commissioning) from production (television,
radio and multimedia) and the creation of a
single national and international news operation.
Since April 1997 the new organisation has
comprised six major components:
• BBC Broadcast, which schedules
channels and commissions services for
audiences in Britain and abroad;
• BBC Production, which develops the
BBC’s in-house radio and television
production capability across all genres
and media;
• BBC News, which is responsible for an
integrated national and international
news operation across the full range of
BBC news and current affairs services;
492
THE MEDIA
• BBC Worldwide, which is responsible for
generating income in Britain and abroad,
and for the World Service;
• BBC Resources, which provides support
facilities and expertise to BBC
programme-makers and broadcasters;
and
• the Corporate Centre, which provides
strategic services to the BBC as a whole.
BBC Television
The BBC broadcasts around 20,000 hours of
television each year on its two domestic
channels to national and regional audiences:
• BBC 1 is the channel of broad appeal. In
1996-97 it broadcast over 1,000 hours of
features, documentaries and current
affairs programmes, together with nearly
1,000 hours of drama and entertainment,
over 650 hours of sport and almost 400 of
children’s programmes.
• BBC 2 is the channel of innovation and
flexibility. It caters for special audience
interests, with a variety of programmes
including documentaries, late-night
comedy and leisure and lifestyle shows.
Programmes are made at, or acquired
through, Television Centre in London and six
major bases throughout Britain (Glasgow in
Scotland, Cardiff in Wales, Belfast in
Northern Ireland, and Birmingham, Bristol
and Manchester in England). Or they are
commissioned from independent producers—
the BBC is obliged to make sure that at least
25 per cent of its original programming comes
from the independent sector.
Education is a central component of the
BBC’s public service commitment. A wide
range of educational programmes is broadcast
for primary and secondary schools (over 90
per cent of which use BBC schools television),
further education colleges and the Open
University (see p. 453), while programmes for
adults cover numeracy, literacy, language
learning, health, work and vocational training.
Books, pamphlets, computer software, and
audio and video cassettes are produced to
supplement the programmes. A night-time
The BBC is developing plans for new
digital television services to be available
free-to-air on all digital delivery systems.
These services, which will increase
choice for licence-fee payers, will include
an extended widescreen BBC 1 and BBC
2, extra digital TV services
supplementing BBC 1 and BBC 2 output
(BBC Choice), 24-hour television news,
enhanced coverage and access to regional
news and information (BBC Inform TV),
and extensive opportunities for
interactive learning in the school,
workplace and home. In addition, from
November 1997 there will be themed
subscription services (operated by BBC
Worldwide and Flextech and called
LJKTV) for those prepared to pay for
them. These services will not be funded
by the licence fee.
education and training service—The Learning
Zone—was launched on BBC 2 in 1995, and
the BBC provides specialist programming for
further education colleges through FETV
(Further Education TV).
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio, broadcasting to the
whole of Britain, serves an audience of 29
million each week, transmitting over 42,000
hours of programmes each year on its five
networks:
• BBC Radio 1 is a leading contemporary
music station (24 hours a day), serving a
target audience of 15- to 24-year-olds. It
plays top-selling, new and specialist
music, covers live performances, social
action campaigns and broadcasts music,
documentaries and news programmes.
• BBC Radio 2 provides a 24-hour service
of popular music (including folk,
country, gospel, rhythm & blues, brass
band, and light classics), comedy, arts
and speech.
• BBC Radio 3 offers a wide repertoire of
classical music and jazz, more than half of
493
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
which is performed live or is specially
recorded, together with drama,
documentaries and discussion (also for 24
hours a day).
• BBC Radio 4 (broadcast with some
differences on FM and Long Wave) has
a backbone of authoritative news and
current affairs coverage, complemented
by drama, science, the arts, religion,
natural history, medicine, finance and
gardening; it also carries parliamentary
coverage, cricket in season on Long
Wave and BBC World Service (see p.
499) overnight.
• Radio 5 Live has news and sports
coverage 24 hours a day.
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING
Independent Television Commission
The ITC is responsible for licensing and
regulating commercial television services
operating in, or from, Britain. These include
ITV (Channel 3), Channel 4, Channel 5,
cable and other local delivery services,
independent teletext services, and satellite
services based in Britain or whose main
establishment is in Britain. Under the
provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1996, the
ITC also has powers to license and regulate
commercial digital terrestrial television and
BBC commercial television services. The
ITC does not make, broadcast or transmit
programmes itself.
The ITC must see that a wide range of
commercial television services is available
throughout Britain and that they are of a high
quality and appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. It must also ensure fair and effective
competition in the provision of these services,
and adherence to the rules on media
ownership.
The ITC regulates the various television
services through licence conditions, codes and
guidelines. The codes cover programme
content, advertising, sponsorship and
technical standards. If a licensee does not
comply with the conditions of its licence or
the codes, the ITC can impose penalties.
These range from a formal warning or a
requirement to broadcast an apology or
correction, to a fine. In extreme
circumstances, a company’s licence may be
shortened or revoked.
ITC staff regularly monitor programmes,
and take into account comments from viewers
and audience research. They are also advised
by 11 Viewer Consultative Councils, and by
committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and
advertising.
ITV (Channel 3)
The first regular ITV programmes began in
London in 1955 (19 years after the BBC
launched the world’s first regular television
service in 1936). ITV is made up of 15
regionally based television companies which
are licensed to supply programmes in the 14
independent television geographical regions.
There are two licences for London, one for
weekdays and the other for the weekend. An
additional ITC licensee provides a national
breakfast-time service, transmitted on the
ITV network.
The ITV licences for Channel 3 are
awarded for a 10-year period by competitive
tender to the highest bidder (who has to have
passed a quality threshold). Licensees must
provide a diverse programme service designed
to appeal to a wide range of viewers’ tastes
and interests. They have a statutory duty to
present programmes made in, and about, their
region, and there is also a requirement for
district and regional programming to be
aimed at different areas within regions.
Each company plans the content of the
programmes to be broadcast in its area. These
are produced by the company itself, by other
programme companies, or are bought from
elsewhere. As with the BBC, at least 25 per
cent of original programming must come
from the independent sector. About one-third
of the output is made up of informative
programmes^news, documentaries, and
coverage of current affairs, education and
religion—while the remainder covers drama,
entertainment, sport, arts and children’s
programmes. Programmes are broadcast 24
hours a day throughout the country. A
common national and international news
494
THE MEDIA
service is provided by Independent
Television News (ITN).
Channel 3 companies are obliged to
operate a national programme network. The
ITV Network Centre, which is owned by the
companies, independently commissions and
schedules programmes.
Operating on a commercial basis, licensees
derive most of their income from selling
advertising time. Their financial resources
and programme production vary
considerably, depending largely on the
population of the areas in which they operate.
Newspaper groups can acquire a controlling
interest in Channel 3 companies, although
safeguards exist to ensure against any undue
concentrations of media ownership (see
p. 491).
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in 1982,
provides a national 24-hour television service
throughout Britain, except in Wales, which
has a corresponding service—S4C (Sianel
Fed war Cymru). Channel 4 is a statutory
corporation, licensed and regulated by the
ITC, and funded by selling its own
advertising time.
Channel 4’s remit is to provide »
programmes with a distinctive character and
to appeal to tastes and interests not generally
catered for by Channel 3. It must present a
suitable proportion of educational
programmes and encourage innovation and
experiment. Channel 4 commissions
programmes from the ITV companies and
independent producers and buys programmes
from overseas.
The fourth channel in Wales is allocated to
S4C, which is regulated by the Welsh Fourth
Channel Authority. Members of the Welsh
Authority are appointed by the Government.
S4C must ensure that a significant proportion
of programming—particularly between 18.30
and 22.00 hours—is in the Welsh language.
At other times S4C transmits national
Channel 4 programmes. Like Channel 4, S4C
sells its own advertising. Roughly 10 per cent
of its income comes from this source, with the
remainder coming from a government grant,
the level of which is fixed in statute.
Channel 5
Britain’s newest national terrestrial channel
went live in March 1997, its 10-year licence
having been awarded by competitive tender
to Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited.
Channel 5 serves about 70 per cent of the
population.
Before the service went on air, the
licensee had to make arrangements to re¬
tune domestic equipment such as video
recorders and satellite receivers to eliminate
interference caused by the new channel’s
transmissions. This operation affected
between four and five million homes and
the licensee was required to carry it out at
no cost to the viewer.
Like Channel 3, the new service is
subject to positive programming
requirements. It must show programmes of
quality and diversity, with a wide range of
original productions and commissions from
independent producers.The new channel is
supported by advertising revenue.
Gaelic Broadcasting Fund
The Gaelic Broadcasting Committee is an
independent body committed to ensuring that a
wide range of quality television and radio
programmes is broadcast in Gaelic for
reception in Scotland. Its members are
appointed by the ITC, in consultation with the
Radio Authority. The Committee distributes
government money to programme makers
through the Gaelic Broadcasting Fund. Gaelic
television programmes funded in this way have
been transmitted since 1993. The Fund was
extended to radio from April 1997.
The Radio Authority
The Radio Authority’s licensing and
regulatory remit covers all independent radio
services, including national, local, cable and
satellite services. Its three main tasks are to
plan frequencies, appoint licensees with a view
to broadening listener choice, and regulate
programming and advertising.
Like the ITC, the Radio Authority has to
make sure that licensed services are of a high
495
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
quality, and offer programmes which will
appeal to many different tastes and interests.
It has published codes covering engineering,
programmes, news and current affairs, and
advertising and sponsorship, to which
licensees must adhere.
Independent National Radio (INR)
There are three independent national radio
services (licences having been awarded by the
Radio Authority through competitive tender),
which all broadcast 24 hours a day:
• Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly
classical music, together with news and
information;
• Virgin 1215, which plays broad-based
rock music (and is supplemented by a
separate Virgin station which operates
under a local London licence); and
• Talk Radio UK, which is a speech-
based service.
Independent Local Radio (ILR)
Independent local radio stations have been
broadcasting in Britain since 1973. ILR
stations broadcast a wide variety of
programmes and news of local interest, as well
as music and entertainment, traffic reports
and advertising. There are also stations
serving ethnic minority communities. The
Radio Authority awards independent local
licences, although not by competitive tender;
the success of licence applications is in part
determined by the extent to which applicants
widen choice and meet the needs and interests
of the people living in the area and in part by
whether they have the necessary financial
resources to sustain programme plans for the
eight-year licence period.
Some of the locations for stations have been
selected with small-scale radio in mind. As
part of its brief to develop a wide range of
radio services, the Authority is licensing a
number of more specialist stations.
The Authority also issues restricted service
licences (RSLs)—short-term RSLs, generally
for periods of up to 28 days, for special events
or trial services, and long-term RSLs,
primarily for student and hospital stations, to
broadcast to specific establishments.
TELETEXT, CABLE AND SATELLITE
SERVICES
Teletext Services
The BBC and independent television each
operate a teletext service, offering constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including news, sport, travel, weather conditions
and entertainment. The teletext system allows
the television signal to carry additional
information which can be selected and displayed
as ‘pages’ of text and graphics on receivers
equipped with the necessary decoders. The BBC
and Channels 3,4 and 5 provide subtitling for
people with hearing difficulties.
The ITC awards teletext licences in
Channels 3,4, and 5 by competitive tender for
a period of ten years. Applicants have to
satisfy certain statutory requirements before
their cash bid can be considered.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for
by subscription. The franchising of cable
systems and the regulation of cable television
services are carried out by the Programmes
and Cable Division of the ITC, while the
Radio Authority issues cable radio licences.
‘Broadband cable’ systems can carry
between 30 and 65 television channels using
analogue technology (including terrestrial
broadcasts, satellite television and channels
delivered to cable operators by landline or
videotape), as well as a full range of
telecommunications services. Digital
technology is being introduced which will
support up to 500 television channels.
Interactive services such as video-on-demand,
home shopping, home banking, security and
alarm services, electronic mail and high-speed
Internet access (see p. 507) are also possible on
cable and trials are being carried out in some
locations. Cable can additionally supply
television services tailored specifically for local
communities; cable operators are testing
496
THE MEDIA
varying programming concepts to find out
what works best at the local level.
Cable franchises have been granted
covering areas which include 80 per cent of all
homes and nearly all urban areas in Britain.
Regulation is as light as possible to encourage
the development of a wide range of services,
and flexible enough to adapt to new
technology. The ITC awards only one
broadband cable franchise in each area. In
mid-1997 there were about 9.5 million homes
able to receive broadband cable services and
nearly 2.75 million subscribing homes.
ITC licences are required for systems
capable of serving more than 1,000 homes.
They are awarded for each area on the basis
of competitive tendering. Systems extending
beyond a single building and up to 1,000
homes require only an individual licence
from OFTEL. Cable investment must be
privately financed.
There are no specific quality controls on
cable services. However, if cable operators also
provide their own programme content as
opposed to just conveying services, they
require a programme services licence from the
ITC, which includes consumer protection
requirements.
Direct Broadcasting by Satellite
Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), by
which television is transmitted directly by
satellite into people’s homes, has been
available throughout Britain since 1989. The
signals from satellite broadcasting are received
through specially designed aerials or ‘dishes’.
Most services are paid for by subscription.
Many British-based satellite television
channels have been set up to supply
programmes to cable operators and viewers
with dishes in Britain and, in some cases,
throughout Europe. Some offer general
entertainment, while others concentrate on
specific areas of interest, such as sport, music,
children’s programmes, and feature films.
Over 30 English language channels were
available to viewers with standard satellite
dishes at the end of 1996. The ITC also
licenses a number of foreign language services,
some of them designed for ethnic minorities
within Britain and others aimed primarily at
audiences in other countries. Viewers in
Britain may also receive a variety of television
services from other European countries. The
largest satellite programmer is BSkyB (British
Sky Broadcasting) which, with over 5 million
subscribers, dominates paid-for television in
Britain.
Satellite services must comply with the
ITC’s programmes, advertising and
sponsorship codes, but they are not subject to
any positive programming obligations.
Satellite radio services must be licensed by
the Radio Authority if they are transmitted
from Britain for general reception within the
country, or if they are transmitted from
outside Britain but are managed editorially
from within it.
OTHER ASPECTS
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC may not obtain revenue from
broadcasting advertisements or from
commercial sponsorship of programmes on its
public service channels. Its policy is to avoid
giving publicity to any firm or organised
interest except when this is necessary in
providing effective and informative
programmes. It does, however, cover
sponsored sporting and artistic events.
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed on
commercial television and radio services,
subject to controls. The ITC and the Radio
Authority operate codes governing advertising
standards and programme sponsorship, and
can impose penalties on broadcasters failing to
comply with them.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast between programmes
as well as in breaks during programmes.
Advertisers are not allowed to influence
programme content. Advertisements must be
distinct and separate from programmes.
Advertising on terrestrial television is limited
to an average of seven minutes an hour during
the day and seven and a half minutes in the
peak evening viewing period. Advertising is
prohibited in broadcasts of religious services
and in broadcasts to schools. Political
advertising and advertisements for betting
(other than the National Lottery, the football
497
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
pools and bingo) are prohibited. All tobacco
advertising is banned on television and
cigarette advertisements are banned on radio.
Religious advertisements may be broadcast on
commercial radio and television, provided
they comply with the guidelines issued by the
ITC and the Radio Authority.
Sponsorship in Independent Broadcasting
In Britain sponsorship is a relatively new way of
helping to finance commercial broadcasting,
although the practice has long been established
in other countries. In return for their financial
contribution, sponsors receive a credit
associating them with a particular programme.
The ITC’s Code of Programme Sponsorship
and the Radio Authority’s Advertising and
Sponsorship Code aim to ensure that sponsors
do not exert influence on the editorial content of
programmes and that sponsorships are made
clear to viewers and listeners. News and current
affairs programmes may not be sponsored.
Potential sponsors for other categories of
programme may be debarred if their
involvement could constrain the editorial
independence of the programme maker in any
way. References to sponsors or their products
must be confined to the beginning and end of a
programme and around commercial breaks;
they must not appear in the programme itself.
All commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins may be sponsored.
Government Publicity
Government publicity material to support
non-political campaigns may be broadcast on
independent television and radio. This is paid
for on a normal commercial basis. Short
public service items, concerning health, safety
and welfare, are transmitted free by the BBC
and independent television and radio. All
government advertisements and public service
information films are subtitled via electronic
text to support people with hearing difficulties.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it certain
obligations over programme content.
Broadcasters must display, as far as possible, a
proper balance and wide range of subject
matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and must not
offend against good taste. Broadcasters must
also comply with legislation relating to
obscenity and incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio
Authority apply codes providing rules on
impartiality, the portrayal of violence and
standards of taste and decency in programmes,
particularly during hours when children are
likely to be viewing or listening. By
convention, television programmes broadcast
before 21.00 hours (or 20.00 hours on certain
cable and satellite services) are expected to be
suitable for a general audience, including
children.
Complaints can be made to the regulators,
including the BBC, which opened its own
Programme Complaints Unit in 1994 to
investigate serious complaints about BBC
television or radio programmes.
Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC)
In April 1997 the Broadcasting Standards
Commission (BSC) was set up, replacing the
Broadcasting Standards Council and the
Broadcasting Complaints Commission, and
combining their functions. The BSC is
required to:
• draw up and review guidance for the
avoidance of unjust or unfair treatment
and unwarranted infringement of privacy
in television and radio;
• draw up and review a code on the
portrayal of violence and sexual conduct
and on standards of taste and decency
(which television and radio broadcasters
would have to take into account when
drawing up their own guidelines);
• monitor and report on the portrayal of
violence, sexual conduct and standards of
taste and decency in programmes
generally;
• consider and adjudicate on complaints
about fairness and standards;
498
THE MEDIA
• represent the Government at
international bodies concerned with
setting standards for broadcasting; and
• make arrangements for undertaking
research into matters related to, or
connected with, fairness and taste and
decency in broadcasting.
Parliamentary and Political
Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament
may be broadcast on television and radio,
either live or, more usually, in recorded and
edited form on news and current affairs
programmes. The BBC has a specific Charter
and Agreement obligation to transmit an
impartial account day by day of the
proceedings in both Houses of Parliament.
The BBC and some of the commercial
services provide time on national radio and
television for an annual series of party political
broadcasts. Party election broadcasts are
arranged following the announcement of a
General Election. In addition, the
Government may make ministerial broadcasts
on radio and television, with opposition
parties also being allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the commercial sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising that they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through BARB (the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board),
owned jointly by the BBC and the ITV
Network Centre. For radio, joint research is
undertaken for BBC radio and for commercial
radio by RAJAR (Radio Joint Audience
Research).
Both the BBC and the commercial sector
conduct regular surveys of audience opinion
on television and radio services. Public
opinion is further assessed by the BBC and
ITC through the work of their advisory
committees, councils and panels.
INTERNATIONAL SERVICES
BBC Worldwide
In 1994 the international and commercial
interests of the BBC were brought together in
BBC Worldwide, to enable the BBC to develop
its role in the fast-expanding broadcast and
media world. BBC Worldwide comprises BBC
World Service Radio, funded by a government
grant, and BBC Worldwide Limited.
World Service
BBC World Service broadcasts by radio in
English and 45 other languages worldwide. It
has a global weekly audience of at least 140
million listeners. This excludes any estimate
for listeners in countries where it is difficult to
survey audiences. The core programming of
news, current affairs, business and sports
reports is complemented by a wide range of
cultural programmes, including drama,
literature and music.
BBC World Service programmes in
English and many other languages are made
available by satellite for rebroadcasting by
agreement with local or national radio stations,
networks and cable operators. BBC World
Service Radio International sells recorded
programmes to other broadcasters in over 100
countries.
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of BBC World Service,
provides transcripts of radio and television
broadcasts from over 140 countries. As well as
providing a vital source of information to the
BBC, this service is also used by other media
organisations, government departments, the
commercial sector and academic institutions.
Worldwide Limited
With responsibility for the BBC’s commercial
television activity, BBC Worldwide Television
is a major international broadcaster and a
leading distributor and co-producer of BBC
programmes.
In 1996-97 BBC Worldwide Television
licensed more than 27,000 hours of
programming to 550 broadcasters in 69
countries, making the BBC the largest European
499
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
exporter of television programmes. Notable
recent successes have been Pride and Prejudice,
People’s Century and Dancing in the Streets.
BBC Worldwide works closely with BBC
production departments, independent
producers and its network of international
offices to determine commercial strategies for
key programmes with international licensing
potential. It is also developing premium
channels to compete in the international
marketplace. Its core service is BBC World, an
advertiser-funded, 24-hour international news
and information channel. The channel provides
news bulletins, in-depth analysis and reports,
and is available to over 50 million homes around
the world. BBC Prime, an entertainment and
drama channel for Europe, has 5 million
subscribers.
BBC Worldwide also operates a large-scale
publishing and licensing operation covering
magazines, books, video, audio sales, CD-Roms
and a commercial on-line service.
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
British Satellite News is an international satellite
news service, produced by WTN (Worldwide
Television News) for the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office. The service, under FCO
editorial control, transmits programmes five days
a week. These are distributed, either by satellite
or on hard copy compilations, free to television
stations throughout Eastern Europe, the Middle
East, Latin America and Asia for use in news
bulletins.
London Radio Services, also produced
through WTN, provides daily radio bulletins in
English, Spanish and Arabic for overseas
distribution by ISDN line and satellite. There
are also a number of radio magazine programmes
available on tape in several languages. London
Television Services is the marketing arm of the
FCO, distributing the television programmes
and videos produced by the Department. These
include UK Today, Inside Britain, Perspective and
many special productions on topical subjects.
International Relations
European Agreements
Britain has implemented two important
European agreements on cross-border
broadcasting: the European Community
Broadcasting Directive (which was revised in
1997) and the Council of Europe Convention
on Transfrontier Television. Under these,
countries have to allow the retransmission of
programmes originating from other
participating countries. They must also ensure
that their own broadcasters observe certain
minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency and the
portrayal of sex and violence on television.
The revised Directive also provides
Community-wide protection for national
measures securing public access to major
events on free-to-air television.
Audiovisual Eureka (AYE), which has a
membership of 33 European countries
including Britain, aims to help improve
aspects of the European audiovisual industry
through practical measures to enhance
training, development and distribution. It
concentrates its work on the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe. Another
important task of AYE has also been to
establish an Audiovisual Observatory based in
Strasbourg which collects, disseminates and
standardises European audiovisual data for the
industry.
Britain plays an active part in the European
Community MEDIA II programme. The
programme (which succeeded MEDIA I on 1
January 1996) is aimed at enhancing the
strength of member states’ national
audiovisual industries by encouraging greater
collaboration between them and wider
distribution of their products.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC and the Radio Authority are
members of the European Broadcasting
Union, which manages Eurovision, the
international network of television news and
programme exchange. The Union is
responsible for co-ordinating the exchange of
programmes and news over the Eurovision
network and intercontinental satellite links. It
provides a forum linking the major public
services and national broadcasters of Western
Europe and other parts of the world, and co¬
ordinates joint operations in radio and
television.
500
THE MEDIA
The Press
More daily newspapers, national and regional,
are sold for every person in Britain than in
most other developed countries. On an
average day nearly 60 per cent of people over
the age of 15 read a national morning
newspaper; over 65 per cent read a Sunday
newspaper. Around 90 per cent of people read
a regional or local newspaper.
National papers have an average total
circulation of over 13 million on weekdays and
15 million on Sundays, although the total
readership is considerably greater. Men are
more likely to read newspapers than women,
and more people in the 25-44 age group read a
daily newspaper than in any other age group.
There are about 1,400 regional and local
newspaper titles and over 6,500 periodical
publications.
Several newspapers have had very long and
distinguished histories. The Observer, for
example, first published in 1791, is the oldest
national Sunday newspaper in the world, and
The Times, Britain’s oldest daily national
newspaper, began publication in 1785.
The press caters for a range of political
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where they
express pronounced views and show obvious
political leanings in their editorial comments,
these may derive from proprietorial and other
non-party influences. Nevertheless, during
general election campaigns many newspapers
recommend their readers to vote for a
particular political party. Even newspapers
which adopt strong political views in their
editorial columns sometimes include feature
and other types of articles by authors of
different political persuasions.
In order to preserve their character and
traditions, some newspapers and periodicals
are governed by trustee-type arrangements.
Others have management arrangements that
try to ensure their editors’ authority and
independence.
In recent years working practices
throughout the newspaper industry have
undergone major changes in response to the
challenges posed by computer-based
technology and the need to contain costs.
Newsprint, more than half of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales revenue,
newspapers and periodicals earn considerable
amounts from their advertising. Indeed, the
press (including newspapers, magazines and
directories) is by far the largest advertising
medium in Britain. Unlike most of its
European counterparts the British press
receives no subsidies and relatively few tax
and postal concessions.
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TITLES
Ownership of the national, London and many
regional daily newspapers lies in the hands of a
number of large corporations, most of which
are involved in the whole field of publishing
and communications.
The National Press
The national press consists of 10 morning
daily papers and 9 Sunday papers (see Table
29.1). At one time London’s Fleet Street was
the centre of the newspaper industry, but now
all the national papers have moved their
editorial and printing facilities to other parts
of London or away from the capital altogether.
Editions of several papers, for example the
Financial Times and The Guardian, are also
printed in other countries.
National newspapers are often described as
‘quality’, ‘mid-market’ or ‘popular’ papers on
the basis of differences in style and content.
Five dailies and four Sundays are usually
described as ‘quality’ newspapers, which are
directed at readers who want full information
on a wide range of public matters. Popular
newspapers appeal to people wanting news of
a more entertaining character, presented more
concisely. ‘Mid-market’ publications cover the
intermediate market. Quality papers are
normally broadsheet (large-sheet) in format
and mid-market and popular papers tabloid
(small-sheet).
Many newspapers are printed in colour and
most produce colour supplements as part of
the Saturday or Sunday paper, with articles on
travel, food and wine, and other leisure topics.
501
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Regional Newspapers
Most towns and cities throughout Britain have
their own regional or local newspaper. These
range from morning and evening dailies to
Sunday papers and others which are published
just once or twice a week. They mainly
include stories of regional or local attraction,
but the dailies also cover national and
international news, often looked at from a local
viewpoint. They also provide a valuable
medium for local advertising.
England
Examples of the top regional daily
newspapers by circulation in England include
the Express & Star (197,500) in the West
Midlands, Birmingham’s Evening Mail
(191,700), Manchester Evening News
(171,500), and Liverpool Echo (159,700). Of
the bigger regional Sunday papers, the
Sunday Mercury in Birmingham sells 145,000
copies and the Sunday Sun in Newcastle
upon Tyne sells 119,000.

502
THE MEDIA
London has one paid-for evening paper,
the Evening Standard, with a circulation of
about 435,000. It provides Londoners with
news and features covering events in the
capital and of national and international
interest. There are local weekly papers for
every district in Greater London; these are
often different local editions of one centrally
published paper.
Wales
The daily morning paper, the Western Mail,
which is published in Cardiff, circulates
throughout Wales (60,300), as does Wales on
Sunday (57,400). Many others give more local
coverage of Welsh events, and the weekly press
includes Welsh-language and bilingual papers.
Welsh community newspapers receive an
annual grant as part of the Government’s wider
financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland
Daily morning papers, with circulations
ranging up to around 700,000, include the
Daily Record (sister paper of the Mirror), the
Scotsman (published in Edinburgh), the Herald,
(published in Glasgow), the Dundee Courier and
Advertiser and the Aberdeen Press and Journal.
Daily evening papers, with circulations up to
138,000, include the Edinburgh Evening News,
Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening
Telegraph and Aberdeen’s Evening Express. The
Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the
Sunday Post and a quality broadsheet paper,
Scotland on Sunday.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has two morning
newspapers, one evening and two Sunday
papers, all published in Belfast, with
circulations ranging from about 46,000 to
137,000. They are the News Letter (unionist),
the Irish News (nationalist), the evening
Belfast Telegraph, Sunday Life and Sunday
World (Northern Ireland edition). There are
just over 50 weeklies. Newspapers from the
Irish Republic, as well as the British national
press, are widely read in Northern Ireland.
Free Distribution Newspapers
Several hundred free distribution newspapers,,
mostly weekly and financed by advertising, are
published in Britain. They have enjoyed rapid
growth in recent years.
Ethnic Minority Publications
Many newspapers and magazines in Britain are
produced by members of ethnic minorities.
Most are published weekly, fortnightly or
monthly. A Chinese newspaper, Sing Tao, the
Urdu Daily Jang and the Arabic Al-Arab,
however, are dailies.
Afro-Caribbean newspapers include the
Gleaner and West Indian Digest. The Voice and
Caribbean Times, both weeklies, are aimed at
the black population in general. The Weekly
Journal, launched in 1992, is the first ‘quality’
broadsheet aimed at Britain’s black community.
The Asian Times is an English language
weekly for people of Asian descent; the Sikh
Courier is produced quarterly. Examples of
ethnic language newspapers include the Urdu
Daily Jang, and the weeklies Garavi Gujarat
and Gujarat Samachar. Publications also
appear in Bengali, Hindi and Punjabi. The
fortnightly Asian Trader and Asian Business are
both successful ethnic business publications,
while Cineblitz International targets those
interested in the Asian film industry.
Many provincial papers print special editions
for their local ethnic minority populations.
THE PERIODICAL PRESS
There are about 6,500 separate periodical
publications which carry advertising. They are
generally defined as either ‘consumer’ titles,
providing readers with leisure-time
information and entertainment, or ‘business
and professional’ titles, which provide people
with material of relevance to their working
lives. Within the former category, there are
general consumer titles, which have a wide
appeal, and consumer specialist titles, aimed
specifically at groups of people with particular
interests, such as motoring or classical music.
A range of literary and political journals,
appearing monthly or quarterly, cater for a
more academic readership. There are also
503
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
many in-house and customer magazines
produced by businesses or public services for
their employees and/or clients.
The weekly periodicals with the highest
sales are those which carry full details of the
forthcoming week’s television and radio
programmes, including satellite schedules.
What’s on TV, Radio Times and TV Times each
have circulations in excess of 1 million.
Reader’s Digest, which covers just about any
subject, has the highest circulation (1.5
million) among monthly magazines.
Women’s magazines also traditionally enjoy
large readerships. The top-selling title is Take
a Break with a weekly circulation of around
1.4 million. Old favourites like Woman’s
Weekly, Woman’s Own, Woman, Woman’s
Realm and My Weekly have circulations
ranging from 250,000 to over 800,000. Several
women’s magazines owned by overseas
publishing houses have attracted large
followings; Prima and Best, for instance, each
sell over 500,000 copies, while Bella and
Hello! are also widely read.
A recent phenomenon has been the
upsurge in the market for men’s general
interest magazines—for example, FHM,
Loaded, Sky Magazine, GQ, Men’s Health
and Maxim. Circulations range from about
149,000 to 365,000.
Children are well served with an array of
comics and papers, while magazines like
Smash Hits, Sugar, Top of the Pops and Bliss,
with their coverage of the pop music scene and
features of interest to young people, are very
popular with teenagers.
Leading journals of opinion include the
Economist, an authoritative, independent
commentator on national and international
affairs, finance and business, and science and
technology; New Statesman, which reviews
social issues, politics, literature and the arts
from an independent socialist point of view;
and the Spectator, which covers similar
subjects from a more conservative standpoint.
A rather more irreverent approach to public
affairs is taken by Private Eye, a satirical
fortnightly with a loyal following.
Weekly ‘listings’ magazines like Time Out
provide details of cultural and other events in
London and other large cities.
There are some 4,300 business and
professional titles, with the highest
concentrations in medicine, business
management, sciences, architecture and
building, social sciences, and computers.
New Scientist, for example, is extending its
readership beyond the strictly scientific
audience, and now has a circulation of over
120,000. Controlled (free) circulation titles
represent about two-thirds of the business and
professional magazine market. Ninety five per
cent of business and professional people
regularly read the publications relevant to
their sector.
NEWS AGENCIES
The top international news agencies operating
in Britain are Reuters, Associated Press and
United Press International. The main agency
which gathers news inside Britain is the Press
Association (PA), which is owned by the
regional newspaper publishers. A number of
other British and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London (for example,
Agence France Presse), and there are smaller
agencies based in other British cities.
The Press Association
The Press Association operates through the
following companies.
PA News, the national news agency for
Britain and the Irish Republic, provides
comprehensive coverage to the national and
regional print, broadcast and electronic media.
Around 1,500 stories and 100 pictures and
graphics are transmitted each day by satellite
and telecommunications links. PA’s national
and regional coverage includes live coverage
from Parliament, business, the courts and
major international events with a British or
Irish interest. PA customers include Teletext,
on-line information providers and Internet
sites (for information on the Internet see p.
507). Other services include a press cuttings
archive, a photo library with over 5 million
pictures, and NewsFile, an on-line news
service.
504
THE MEDIA
PA Sport provides comprehensive coverage
of British and Irish sport, including fixtures,

PRESS INSTITUTIONS
Trade associations include the Newspaper
Publishers Association, whose members
publish national newspapers, and the
Newspaper Society, which represents British
regional and local newspapers. The Scottish
Daily Newspaper Society represents the
interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in
Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Publishers’
Association acts on behalf of the owners of
weekly newspapers in Scotland; and
Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers is
made up of proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland. The membership of the
Periodical Publishers Association includes
most independent publishers of business,
professional and consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are
the National Union of Journalists and the
Chartered Institute of Journalists. The main
printing union is the Graphical, Paper and
Media Union, with a membership of around
200,000.
The Foreign Press Association was formed
in 1888 to help the correspondents of overseas
newspapers in their work by arranging press
conferences, tours, briefings, and other
services and facilities.
The Guild of Editors is the officially
recognised professional body for newspaper
editors and their equivalents in radio and
television. It has approximately 500 members
and exists to defend press freedom and to
promote high editorial standards. The British
Association of Industrial Editors is the
professional organisation for editors of house
journals. The Association of British Editors
represents the whole range of media,
including radio, television, newspapers and
magazines.
Training
A wide range of newspaper training courses
are accredited by the National Council for the
Training of Journalists (NCTJ), while
magazine courses are accredited by the
Periodical Training Council (the training arm
of the Periodical Publishers Association).
Courses for regional newspapers in such
subjects as newspaper sales, advertising and
management are provided by training services
endorsed by the Newspaper Society. Some
newspaper publishers carry out journalist
training independently of the NCTJ. The
Newspaper Society is the leading body for the
development of National Vocational
Qualifications (see p. 448) in the newspaper
industry.
PRESS CONDUCT AND LAW
The Press Complaints Commission
In a free society, there is a delicate and
sometimes difficult balance in the relationship
between the responsibilities of the press and
the rights of the public. The Press
Complaints Commission, a non-statutory
body, was set up in 1991 by the newspaper
and periodical industry following
recommendations in a report on privacy and
the press by an independent committee. This
was in response to growing criticism of press
standards, with allegations of unjustified
invasion of privacy and inaccurate and biased
reporting, which resulted in calls for
government regulation of the press.
In 1995 the Government rejected proposals
for statutory regulation and for legislation to
give protection to privacy. Instead, it
endorsed self-regulation under the
505
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Commission, and recommended tougher
measures to make self-regulation more
effective.
The Commission’s membership is drawn
from both the public and the press. It deals
with complaints about the content and
conduct of newspapers and magazines, and
operates a code of practice agreed by editors
covering such failings as inaccuracy, invasion
of privacy, harassment and discrimination by
the press.
The industry and the Commission have
introduced measures to reinforce voluntary
regulation. These include an increase in the
number of independent members of the
Commission to ensure a lay majority, the
incorporation of the code of practice into the
contracts of employment of most editors and
journalists, and the appointment of a Privacy
Commissioner with special powers to
investigate complaints about invasion of
privacy.
The Press and the Law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and
newspaper proprietors, editors and journalists
are subject to the law in the same way as any
other citizen. However, certain statutes
include sections which apply to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies (see
p. 491);
• the transfer of newspaper assets; and
• the right of press representatives to be
supplied with agendas and reports for
meetings of local authorities, and
reasonable facilities for taking notes and
telephoning reports.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer’s name and
address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Library (see p.
487).
Publication of advertisements is governed
by wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, copyright, financial services and fraud
legislation. Legal restrictions are imposed on
certain types of prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press.
A newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the courts
for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings, nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such
areas as defence and international relations,
where such unauthorised disclosure would be
harmful, are offences under the Official
Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989. However, these are
restrictions on publication—that is, on
dissemination to the public by any means—
not just through the printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press
are libel actions brought by private
individuals.
Defence Advisory Notices
Government officials and representatives of
the media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which has
agreed that in some circumstances the
publication of certain categories of
information might endanger national security.
Details of these categories are contained in
Defence Advisory Notices (DA Notices)
circulated to the media, whose members are
asked to seek advice from the Secretary of the
Committee, a retired senior military officer,
before publishing information in these areas.
Compliance with any advice offered by the
Secretary is expected but there is no legal
force behind it and the final decision on
whether to publish rests with the editor,
producer or publisher concerned.
The Notices were published for the first
time in 1993 to promote a better
understanding of the system and to contribute
to greater openness in government.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, sales
506
THE MEDIA
promotions, cinema, direct mail, and
electronic media such as CD-ROM and the
Internet, is regulated by the Advertising
Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA is an
independent body which sees that everyone
who prepares and publishes advertisements
conforms to the British Codes of Advertising
and Sales Promotion. The Codes are written
and enforced by the advertising industry
through the Committee of Advertising
Practice (CAP). They require that
advertisements and promotions:
• are legal, decent, honest and truthful;
• are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer and
society; and
• respect the principles of fair competition
generally accepted in business.
The ASA monitors advertisements to
ensure their compliance with the Codes and
investigates any complaints received. Pre¬
publication advice is provided by CAP’s copy
advice team to assist publishers, agencies and
advertisers. If an advertisement is found to be
unacceptable because it is misleading or
offensive, the ASA can ask the advertiser to
change or remove it. Failure to do so can
result in damaging adverse publicity in the
ASA’s monthly report of its judgments, the
refusal of advertising space by publishers, and
the loss of trading privileges. In the rare cases
of deliberate or persistent offending, the ASA
can also refer misleading advertisements to
the Director General of Fair Trading, who
has the power to seek an injunction to prevent
their publication.
THE MEDIA AND THE INTERNET
The Internet is among the most far-reaching
of recent developments in electronic
communications. It plays a new and
increasingly important role in the provision
and dissemination of information and
entertainment. Broadly, it is a loose collection
of computer networks around the world—it
links thousands of academic, government,
military and public computer systems, giving
millions of people access to a wealth of stored
information and other resources. No one
owns it—there is no centralised controlling or
regulating body. To access, or send out,
information an Internet user needs only a
computer with the necessary software, a
telephone and a modem (which allows
computers to talk to each other over a
telephone line).
The system dates from the 1960s, when it
began life in the military and academic
communities in the United States. It has only
assumed widespread significance in
commercial and consumer terms during the
present decade. It is the World Wide Web
(WWW or Web) which has given the Internet
its user appeal and accessibility. The Web
consists of tens of thousands of pages or ‘sites’
on the Internet, which can be viewed by a
browser (a programme that provides a
window in a computer screen on which the
pages are displayed). Users can move from
page to page in search of whatever
information or service they are after.
For an increasingly computer-literate
generation of consumers, the Internet could
become a real alternative to more traditional
media. Aware of this possibility, many
publishers and broadcasters have established
sites on the World Wide Web. British press
interests which have a presence on the system
include the Daily Mail, The Times, The
Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, the Mirror
Group, and the Press Association—and also
prominent magazine publishers, like Emap,
IPC and Time Out. There are over 100
regional newspaper Websites, offering a range
of editorial, directory and advertising
services. Broadcasters, such as the BBC and
Channel 4, are also represented.

Over 100 British sportsmen and women currently hold world championship
titles. Britain won a total of 15 medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and 122
at the subsequent Paralympics. The National Lottery is now making a
significant contribution towards financing sport, both at grass roots and elite
levels, and will be helping to finance major developments such as the planned
new national stadium in England and the British Academy of Sport. The
Government intends to extend opportunities for participation through a
national sports strategy, now being developed, which will embrace all sections
of the community.
About 29 million people in Britain over the
age of 16 regularly take part in sport or
exercise. The most popular participation
sports or activities are walking (including
rambling and hiking), swimming,
snooker/pool, keep fit/yoga and cycling.
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport is responsible for the Government’s
policies on sport and recreation in England. The
Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have similar responsibilities in
their countries. Responsibility for aspects of
government sports policy of benefit to Britain
as a whole rests with the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport, in association with
the respective home country Secretaries of
State.
Within its overall policy of‘Sport for AH’,
the Government is developing a national
sports strategy, and intends to work in
partnership with local authorities, sports
governing bodies and sporting agencies, to
produce an integrated approach to sports
provision. The strategy is intended to
improve sporting performance at all levels
and to extend opportunities for
participation in sport.
Sports Councils
Government responsibilities in sport and
recreation are largely channelled through the
Sports Councils. There are separate sports
councils for England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland, while the United Kingdom
Sports Council (UKSC) takes the lead on all
509
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
aspects of sport and physical recreation which
require strategic planning, administration, co¬
ordination or representation for Britain as a
whole. The UKSC currently has nine
members, including the chairmen of the home
country Sports Councils and key individuals
from amateur and professional sport.
The UKSC is particularly concerned with
providing support for top-level athletes, to
ensure that British sport in future produces a
constant flow of world-class performers and
winners. Key functions include:
• identifying sporting policies for Britain as
a whole;
• identifying areas of unnecessary
duplication and waste in the
administration of sport;
• developing and delivering appropriate
grant programmes for sports bodies
covering Britain or Great Britain as a
whole and for sports which have potential
for success at an international level;
• managing the development of the British
Academy of Sport;
• co-ordinating policy for bringing major
international sports events to Britain;
• representing British sporting interests
overseas and increasing influence at
international level; and
• working to develop a fair and ethical
sporting environment for all.
The home country Sports Councils operate
wide-ranging grant programmes, from
encouraging the development of sport for
young people to developing sporting
excellence on a national basis. They also
manage the National Sports Centres (see p.
514), and are responsible for distributing the
National Lottery Sports Fund (see p. 519).
As part of its new approach to sport, the
Government has concluded that there is a
need to review the way in which the Sports
Councils are working, to ensure that they
operate efficiently for the future in the best
interests of sport.
Local Authorities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the
In November 1996 the World Class
Performance Programme was launched to
provide support across Britain to the most
talented athletes competing up to Olympic
and world championship level. The funds
are expected to be available to some 4,500
top sportspeople. Three further
programmes are planned:
• the World Class Events Programme,
designed to attract and stage major
international events in Britain;
• the World Class Start Programme, to
provide community coaching and
leadership schemes; and
• the World Class Potential Programme,
to develop talent in schools and sports
clubs.
These initiatives will be funded from the
National Lottery Sports Fund. The
programmes should contribute around £50
million a year to sport in Britain when they
are all under way.
local community. In England they manage
over 1,500 indoor sports centres. Other
facilities include parks, lakes, playing fields,
tennis courts, artificial pitches, golf courses
and swimming/leisure pools. Many local
authorities employ full-time sports
development officers. The Government
intends to encourage each local authority to
develop a leisure strategy in which sport
would have a prominent role, with the aim of
ensuring that the provision of sporting
facilities meets local needs.
Sports Clubs
Local sports clubs provide a wide variety of
recreational facilities. Some cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those
providing sports grounds, particularly for
cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis and
golf. Over 150,000 voluntary sports clubs are
affiliated to the national governing bodies of
sport. Many clubs linked to business firms
cater for sporting activities. Commercial
facilities include fitness centres, tenpin
bowling centres, ice and roller-skating rinks,
510
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
squash courts, golf courses and driving ranges,
riding stables and marinas.
National Sports Associations
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
(CCPR) is the largest sport and recreation
federation in the world. It comprises 209 British
bodies and 68 English associations, most of
which are governing bodies of sport. The
Scottish Sports Association, the Welsh Sports
Association and the Northern Ireland Sports
Forum (NISF) are related associations. Their
primary aim is to represent the interests of their
members to the appropriate national and local
authorities, including the Sports Councils, from
which they receive funding. Award schemes run
by the associations include the CCPR’s
Community Sports Leaders Award scheme,
which attracts some 36,000 youngsters each
year, and the NISF’s Service to Sport Awards.
British Olympic Association
The British Olympic Association (BOA) is the
National Olympic Committee for Britain and
comprises representatives of the 35 governing
bodies of Olympic sports. It organises the
participation of British teams in the Olympic
Games, determines the size of British Olympic
teams, sets standards for selection and raises
funds. It is supported by sponsorship and by
donations from the private sector and the
public. Over 300 competitors represented
Britain in the 1996 Olympics and won 15
medals: one gold, eight silver and six bronze.
The BOA also makes important
contributions to the preparation of competitors
in the period between Games, such as
arranging training camps. The Association’s
British Olympic Medical Centre at Northwick
Park Hospital in north London supplies a
medical back-up service for competitors before
and during the Olympics.
The BOA is investigating the possibility of a
British bid for the Olympic Games in the early
part of the 21st century.
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 400
independent governing bodies. 4 heir
functions include drawing up rules, holding
events, regulating membership, and selecting
and training national teams. Governing bodies
receiving long-term funding from the Sports
Councils are required to produce four-year
development plans, from the grass roots to the
highest competitive levels. In order to have
access to Lottery funds, they now need also to
prepare ‘world-class performance’ plans, with
specific performance targets. There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking and cycling. Most sports clubs
in Britain belong to, or are affiliated to, the
appropriate governing body.
National Coaching Foundation
The National Coaching Foundation (NCF)
works closely with sports governing bodies,
local authorities, and higher and further
education. Supported by the Sports Councils,
it provides a comprehensive range of
education and development services for
coaches in all sports. It has ten regional offices
in England, and one each in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
The NCF also runs Champion Coaching,
one of the elements of the National Junior
Sport Programme (see p. 512). Champion
Coaching provides after-school coaching in a
variety of sports in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. In 1997-98 there will be 150
local authority schemes, with about 11,500
children and 1,000 coaches participating.
Sport in Schools and for Young People
The Government is planning to develop
further the sporting opportunities for young
people. It has set up a new Youth Sports Unit
in the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport. Sport for young people is given a high
priority by the Sports Councils.
Physical education (PE), which includes
sport, is a compulsory subject in the National
Curriculum (see p. 439) for all pupils aged 5 to
16 in state-maintained schools in England and
Wales and in the common curriculum in
Northern Ireland. All schools have to include
in their prospectuses details of their sporting
511
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
aims and provision for sport, and to record in
their governors’ reports how they have met
these aims.
The Government believes that sport
should be a fundamental part of school life
and it will be looking at ways of promoting
sport in schools. The Government also
intends to introduce after-school clubs,
which would be funded through the
National Lottery Sports Fund and include
provision for additional sporting
opportunities for children.
In Scotland the National Guidelines contain
programmes of study and attainment targets
for physical activity for pupils aged 5 to 14.
The Scottish Sports Council is preparing a
national scheme under which each school
would have a school sports co-ordinator.
A new initiative designed to encourage
young people to participate in sport was
launched in 1997. Leading sports figures will
be visiting schools and local clubs to set out
the benefits of a wide range of sports. Lottery
funds will also be made available to schools for
additional sports coaching.
Assessment of Sporting Facilities
Two new schemes have been set up to assess
the sporting merits of schools:
• a Sportsmark scheme to recognise
schools that have effective policies for
promoting sport; and
• ‘Sportsmark Gold’ awards for the most
innovative schools or those showing
exceptional achievement.
Playing Fields
The Government is looking at the options to
meet its commitment of ensuring that playing
fields needed by schools and their local
communities are not sold in the future. In the
meantime, the respective national Sports
Councils must be consulted on planning
proposals affecting all playing fields in Great
Britain.
Links with the Local Community
Links between schools and the local
community are being encouraged so that, for
example, children have access to the sports
amenities which clubs and associations can
make available outside school hours. A fl
million challenge fund was established in
England in 1996 to promote links between
schools and sports clubs or governing bodies.
National Junior Sport Programme
The National Junior Sport Programme in
England aims to encourage sporting
participation and to develop children’s sports
skills. It is run by the English Sports Council
(ESC). Key partners include the Youth Sport
Trust, the physical education profession, local
authorities, youth clubs, the National
Coaching Foundation and national governing
bodies of sport. An important component is
the TOP programme designed to provide 4
million children with sports equipment,
qualified coaches and places to play. Over the
three years to 1998 about £14 million is being
provided by the National Lottery Sports
Fund, the ESC and private sector funding
including business sponsorship. .
The scheme has several elements,
including:
• Top Play, for those aged four to nine,
aims to develop core skills, such as co¬
ordination, ball skills and teamwork;
• BT Top Sport, for those aged 7 to 11,
introduces children to specific sports,
such as cricket, football, rugby and tennis;
• Champion Coaching (see p. 511), run by
the National Coaching Foundation;
• Top Club, a programme which assists
clubs in developing junior coaching and
competitive opportunities for young
people; and
• Sports Fair, a programme to promote
sporting activity with youth groups.
Women and Sport
The Government is keen to improve
opportunities for women in sport, where their
512
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
participation has been at a significantly lower
rate than that of men. This will be an
important aspect of the national sports
strategy.
Sporting agencies, including the Sports
Councils and the Women’s Sports Federation
(WSF), promote the interests of women and
girls in sport and active recreation. The WSF
encourages the establishment of women’s
sports groups throughout Britain and
organises events and activities. It runs both
the Sportswomen of the Year Awards and
an annual nationwide awards scheme for
girls and young women between the ages of
11 and 19.
Organisations are required to include ways
of encouraging the participation of women
when applying for support from the National
Lottery Sports Fund. This is helping to
increase participation of women, especially in
sports that have traditionally been dominated
by men.
Sport for Disabled People
The governing bodies of sport are increasingly
taking responsibility for disabled people.
There is close liaison with the Sports
Councils, which provide advice to governing
bodies on encouraging the integration of
people with disabilities.
The key organisations for people with
disabilities are:
• Disability Sport England (formerly the
British Sports Association for the
Disabled), a national body working across
all the disabilities, which organises
regional and national championships in
many sports and also runs training
courses, coaching courses and
development days. The Scottish and the
Welsh Sports Associations for the
Disabled and the Northern Ireland
Committee on Sport for People with
Disabilities have similar co-ordinating
roles;
• the United Kingdom Sports Association
for People with Learning Disability
(UKSAPLD), a co-ordinating body with
a membership of over 20 national
organisations, which promotes and
develops opportunities in sport and
recreation for people with learning
disability; and
• the British Paralympic Association
(BPA), which organises Britain’s
participation in the Paralympics, in close
liaison with the British Olympic
Association. The UKSAPLD is
responsible, in partnership with the BPA,
for the preparation and training of the
Paralympic team. In 1996, 244
competitors represented Britain in the
Paralympics and won 122 medals: 39
gold, 42 silver and 41 bronze.
There are also bodies concerned with
individual disabilities and single sports. The
Riding for the Disabled Association, for
example, caters for some 25,000 riders, and
there are five national disability sports
organisations concerned with individual
disabilities: the British Amputee and Les
Autres Sports Association; British Blind
Sport; the British Deaf Sports Council; the
British Wheelchair Sports Foundation; and
Cerebral Palsy Sport. They provide coaching
and help to organise national competitions in
conjunction with the governing bodies of sport
and Disability Sport England.
Other Organisations
The Countryside Commission (for England),
the Countryside Council for Wales and
Scottish Natural Heritage are responsible for
conserving the natural beauty of the
countryside, and for encouraging the
provision of facilities for open-air recreation.
They are working with the Sports Councils to
ensure that outdoor recreation and sport are
managed according to the principles of
sustainable development.
British Waterways is a publicly owned body
responsible for managing and developing much
of Great Britain’s inland waterways. Many
leisure and recreational pursuits, such as angling
and various types of sailing and boating, are
enjoyed on waterways and reservoirs.
In Northern Ireland the Environment and
Heritage Service, an agency within the
Department of the Environment, is
responsible for protecting the natural
environment and promoting its appreciation.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
MAJOR SPORTS FACILITIES
Britain has a range of world-class sporting
facilities including 13 National Sports
Centres, run by the Sports Councils,
Wembley Stadium in London is to be
redeveloped as the new national stadium for
England, and up to £80 million is being
provided to support facilities in Manchester,
which will host the Commonwealth Games in
2002. These include £60 million for a new
sports stadium and nearly £20 million for an
Olympic-sized swimming complex.
British Academy of Sport
A British Academy of Sport is to be established.
It is a key element of the proposal to provide
customised support services to top-level
sportsmen and women, including the integrated
development and delivery of sports science,
sports medicine and coaching. The Academy
will provide world-class services and training
facilities, and will co-ordinate a network of
regional centres of sporting excellence.
Three sites have been selected as possible
locations from an original list of 26 bids. The
Government is considering its preferred site.
National Stadium
A new national 80,000 all-seater stadium for
England is to be located at Wembley (London).
This will involve rebuilding the existing
stadium, and it is expected to be ready in time
for the FA (Football Association) Cup Final in
2002. Facilities of the highest standard will be
provided and the stadium will be capable of
hosting major world sporting events. It will cost
around £210 million, of which £120 million
will be provided from Lottery funding.
National Sports Centres
First priority at the National Sports Centres is
given to the governing bodies of sport for
national squad training and for the training of
coaches. Centres also make their facilities
available to top sportsmen and women for
individual training and to the local
community. Most Centres provide residential
facilities.
England
The English Sports Council (ESC) runs six
major National Sports Centres. Crystal Palace
in London is a leading competition venue for a
wide range of sports and a major training
centre for national squads, clubs and schools,
and serious enthusiasts. It is a regional centre
of excellence for athletics, netball,
weightlifting and swimming. Crystal Palace
stadium is Britain’s major international
athletics venue, with capacity for 17,000
spectators. Other facilities include Olympic-
size swimming and diving pools and a sports
injury centre. The Centre also houses the
National Boxing Academy. The long-term
future of Crystal Palace is being reviewed,
partly in the light of the redevelopment of
Wembley as a new national stadium and the
forthcoming establishment of the British
Academy of Sport.
Bisham Abbey in Berkshire caters for a
number of sports, including tennis, football,
hockey, weightlifting, squash, rugby union
and golf. The England football and rugby
union squads train at the Centre. Bisham
Abbey has long-standing partnerships with
the British Amateur Weightlifting Association
and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA),
which has helped to develop the Abbey as the
National Tennis Training Centre and the
home of the LTA Rover Tennis School.
Lilleshall National Sports Centre in
Shropshire offers extensive sports facilities,
which are used by a variety of national teams.
Facilities include the Olympic Gymnastics
Centre, regularly used by the British
gymnastic squads, and extensive playing fields
for football and hockey. The Football
Association uses Lilleshall as its base for major
coaching activities. Lilleshall also houses the
Olympic Archery Centre.
The National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont in Nottinghamshire is one
of the most comprehensive water sports
centres in the world. It has facilities for
rowing, canoeing, water-skiing, powerboating,
ski-racing, angling and sailing. Its main
features are a 2,000-metre regatta course and
the only purpose-built floodlit canoe slalom
course in the world.
The National Cycling Centre, opened in
Manchester in 1994, is Britain’s first indoor
514
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
velodrome. It was the venue for the World
Cycling Championships in 1996.
Wales
The Sports Council for Wales runs two
National Sports Centres:
• The Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff
is the country’s premier venue for top-
level training and for competition in
many sports. Facilities include a world-
standard gymnastics hall, a sports science
laboratory and a sports injury clinic.
• The National Watersports Centre at Plas
Menai in north Wales is a centre of
excellence for sailing and canoeing;
activities include dinghy and catamaran
sailing, offshore cruising and powerboat
training.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre, a
third centre, is run by the English Sports
Council. Situated in Snowdonia National Park
in north Wales, it offers courses in rock
climbing, mountaineering, canoeing,
orienteering, skiing and most other mountain-
based activities. It is Britain’s leading training
institution for the development of mountain
instructors.
Scotland
Scotland has three National Sports Centres,
which are run by the Scottish Sports Council:
• The Scottish National Outdoor Centre at
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore caters
for a range of activities, including hill
walking, rock climbing, mountaineering,
skiing, kayaking and canoeing. Its main
purpose is to provide top-quality training
for those who intend to lead or instruct
others in outdoor activities.
• The Scottish National Sports Centre—
Inverclyde—at Largs, has a large number
of facilities, including a gymnastics hall, a
golf training facility and a laboratory for
fitness assessment. The Centre also acts
as an important venue for major
championships. Inverclyde was used by
32 governing bodies of sport in 1996—97,
many of them using it as their national
training and coaching base.
• The Scottish National Water Sports
Centre—Cumbrae—on the island of
Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde,
offers an extensive range of courses
catering for all levels of ability. It has a
comprehensive range of modern craft for
a variety of sailing activities, as well as
sub-aqua diving equipment. Cumbrae
hosts major sailing championships.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Centre for Outdoor
Activities at Tollymore in County Down, run
by the Sports Council for Northern Ireland,
offers courses in mountaineering, rock
climbing, canoeing and outdoor adventure.
Leadership and instructor courses resulting in
nationally recognised qualifications are also
available.
A Northern Ireland Outdoor Team Sports
Training Centre is under development in
Belfast. The first phase, involving two new
synthetic pitches, was opened in 1995 at
Queen’s University of Belfast Playing Fields.
SPORTS MEDICINE AND SCIENCE
Sports Medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute,
funded by the UKSC and ESC, is responsible
for the co-ordination of sports medicine
services. Based at the medical college of St
Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, its facilities
include a physiology laboratory, library and
information centre. Work is in progress to
develop a network of regional centres to
provide both clinical and educational services,
which will be linked with new support services
at the National Sports Centres.
In Scotland a network of 33 sports
medicine centres provides specialist help with
sports injuries. The Scottish Institute of
Sports Medicine and Sports Science, opened
in 1995, aims to form partnerships with
national governing bodies to provide athletes
and coaches with high-quality medical and
scientific support.
515
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
A Northern Ireland Sports Medicine
Centre was established in 1996 as a
partnership between the Sports Council for
Northern Ireland and a local healthcare trust.
Sports Science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is being promoted by the Sports
Councils, in collaboration with the British
Olympic Association and the National
Coaching Foundation, in an effort to raise the
standards of performance of national squads.
The type of support provided may cover
biomechanical (human movement),
physiological or psychological factors. There
are 24 national governing bodies involved in
the UKSC’s Sports Science Support
Programme. The Sports Council for Wales
has established a sports science service at the
Welsh Institute of Sport with support from
the Welsh Office.
Drug Misuse
The UKSC aims to prevent doping in sport
and achieve a commitment to drug-free sport
and ethical sporting practices. Its Ethics and
Anti-Doping Directorate co-ordinates a drug¬
testing programme and conducts a
comprehensive education programme aimed at
changing attitudes to drug misuse.
In running its drug-testing programme, the
UKSC is responsible for the collection of
samples; arranging their analysis at a
laboratory accredited by the International
Olympic Committee, at King’s College,
University of London; and reporting the
results to the appropriate governing body.
The UKSC’s programme involves nearly 80
national governing bodies and 24 international
sporting federations from 47 sports. Nearly
4,500 tests were conducted in 1996—97—over
2,800 in competition and 1,650 out of
competition—and 98 per cent were negative.
The UKSC provides a Drug Information
Line to allow athletes to check whether a
licensed medication is banned or permitted
under their governing body’s regulations.
Anabolic steroids and other anabolic
substances (such as growth hormones) have
recently become controlled drugs, and greater
penalties for their unauthorised supply have
been introduced. This is expected to help to
eliminate their misuse in sport and other
leisure activities such as bodybuilding.
Britain has implemented the Council of
Europe’s Anti-doping Convention, designed
to ensure minimum national standards for the
organisation of doping control. Five
countries—Britain, Australia, Canada, New
Zealand and Norway—have signed the
International Anti-Doping Arrangement to
facilitate the development of high-quality
domestic anti-doping programmes and of
internationally recognised standards in anti-
doping programmes.
SPECTATOR SAFETY
Safety at sports grounds in Great Britain is
governed by legislation. The main instrument
of control is a safety certificate which is issued
by the relevant local authority. When
determining the conditions of a safety
certificate, the local authority is expected to
comply with the Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds produced by the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport and The Scottish
Office. Similar legislation in Northern Ireland
is under discussion.
The Taylor Report
Following the Hillsborough stadium disaster
in Sheffield in 1989, when 96 spectators died,
the Taylor Report was published in 1990. Its
major recommendation was that standing
accommodation should be eliminated at all
grounds designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975. The Government accepted
the report but limited the all-seating
requirement to football.
In England and Wales the all-seater policy
is being enforced through licences issued by
the Football Licensing Authority. These
require all clubs in the Premier League and
those in the First Division of the Football
League to have all-seater grounds; these
conditions have now largely been satisfied.
Clubs in the Second and Third Divisions of
the Football League are permitted to keep
some standing accommodation, providing that
516
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
the terracing is safe. In Scotland the all¬
seating policy is being implemented through a
voluntary agreement under the direction of
the Scottish football authorities.
The Football Trust
The Football Trust provides grant aid to help
football clubs at all levels. It is funded partly
by contributions from football governing
bodies and partly from reductions in pool
betting duty which will continue until 2000.
These concessions have provided over £144
million to assist football clubs with projects to
improve the comfort and safety of spectators
in line with the Taylor Report
recommendations. In June 1997 further
funding of £55 million over the next four
years was announced to enable the Trust to
continue its programme of football ground
safety and improvement work. This extra
funding will come from the ESC’s Lottery
Fund, the Football Association and the FA
Premier League.
The Football Trust also administers
funding of safety work at rugby league, rugby
union and cricket grounds under the Sports
Grounds Initiative.
Crowd Control
The Government has worked closely with the
police, football authorities and the
governments of other European countries to
implement crowd control measures. Extensive
measures ensured that Euro 96—the final of
the European Championship (see p. 523)—
was not disrupted by violence or disorder.
Strict crowd control and surveillance
measures were taken at the eight grounds in
England where matches were held.
Legislation has made it an offence in
England and Wales to throw objects at football
matches, run onto the playing area or chant
indecent or racist abuse. There are also
controls on the sale and possession of alcohol
at football grounds and on transport to and
from grounds. Courts in England and Wales
have the power to prohibit convicted football
hooligans from attending football matches,
and to impose restriction orders to prevent
them travelling abroad to attend specified
matches. In Northern Ireland similar
legislation is under consideration.
The Government has established a Football
Task Force to investigate and recommend new
measures to deal with public concerns on a
range of issues, including racism, ticket prices
and access for the disabled. Measures are also
being considered by the Government on
crowd violence and racist abuse, including
higher penalties for such abuse at football
matches.
SPONSORSHIP AND OTHER
FUNDING
Sport is a major industry in Britain. In
addition to professional sportsmen and
women, over 450,000 people are employed in
the provision of sports clothing, publicity,
ground and club maintenance and other
activities connected with sport. Consumer
expenditure on sport in Britain is estimated at
some £10,400 million a year. The private
sector makes a substantial investment in sport,
with more than 2,000 British companies
involved.
Sports sponsorship reached a record level in
1996, at £340 million, 19 per cent higher
than in 1995. This reflected a boost from
Euro 96 to which sponsors contributed
£38.5 million. Nearly 1,000 separate sports
sponsorship deals were reported in 1996.
Sponsorship may take the form of financing
specific events or championships, such as
horse races or cricket leagues, or of grants to
sports organisations or individual performers.
Motor sport and football receive the largest
amounts of private sponsorship. Sponsorship
is encouraged by a number of bodies,
including:
• the Institute of Sports Sponsorship, set
up by the Central Council of Physical
Recreation (CCPR) and which comprises
some 80 British companies involved in
sponsoring sport; and
• the Sports Sponsorship Advisory
Service, administered by the CCPR and
517
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
funded by the ESC, and similar advisory
services of the Scottish Sports Council
and the Sports Council for Wales.
Legislation is planned to ban all forms of
tobacco advertising and promotion (see p.
408), and the Department of Health is
consulting the Department for Culture, Media
and Sport to ensure that the ban is
implemented in a way which minimises any
damage to sport. Early in 1998 a White Paper
will set out the Government’s plans to tackle
tobacco consumption. These will include a
transitional period to allow sports bodies to
identify and secure alternative sponsors.
Sportsmatch
Sportsmatch aims to increase the amount of
business sponsorship going into ‘grass roots’
sport and physical recreation. It offers
matching funding for new sponsorships and
extension of existing ones. Priority is given to
projects involving the young, disabled people
and ethnic minorities and to projects in
deprived areas.
In England the Institute of Sports
Sponsorship runs the scheme on behalf of the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
Between 1992 and July 1997 Sportsmatch
approved over 1,800 awards in England,
totalling £14.7 million and covering nearly 70
different sports. Football, rugby union,
cricket, tennis and basketball have received
most awards. Minority sports, such as
korfball, orienteering and trampolining, have
also received awards. About half the
companies involved are sponsoring sport for
the first time. In Scotland and Wales the
scheme is managed by the appropriate Sports
Council’s Sponsorship Advisory Service.
Sports Aid Foundation
The Sports Aid Foundation raises funds to
help talented British individual sportspeople
to meet their personal training expenses.
Assistance is given to those needing financial
help and is concentrated on individuals who
do not qualify for awards from the National
Lottery Sports Fund. The Foundation raises
its funds by commercial sponsorship and by
donations from companies, local authorities,
voluntary organisations and members of the
public. The Scottish and Welsh Sports Aid
Foundations and the Ulster Sports and
Recreation Trust have similar functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts was
set up by the football pools promoters in 1991
to channel funds into sport and the arts. This
followed the Budget in which pool betting
duty was reduced by 2.5 per cent, provided
that the money forgone by the Government
was paid into the new Foundation. In
addition, the pools promoters passed on an
additional 5 pence in the pound levy on pools
coupons to the Foundation. About £33
million was given to sports schemes in
1995-96. The Foundation has made awards to
schemes benefiting over 100 sports and
totalling £200 million.
Betting and Gaming
Most betting in Britain takes place on horse
racing and greyhound racing. Bets may be
made at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or
through about 8,500 licensed off-course
betting offices, which take about 90 per cent of
the money staked. A form of pool betting—
totalisator betting—is organised on
racecourses by the Horserace Totalisator
Board (the Tote). Racecourse bets may also be
placed with on-course bookmakers. Betting on
other sporting events, such as football, is
becoming more popular.
Bookmakers and the Tote contribute an
annual levy—a fixed proportion of their
turnover—to the Horserace Betting Levy
Board. The amount of levy payable is decided
by the racing and bookmaking industries or, if
agreement cannot be reached, by the Home
Secretary. The Levy Board promotes the
improvement of horse breeds, advancement of
veterinary science and the improvement of
horse racing.
In 1996-97 the total money staked in all
forms of gambling, excluding gaming
machines, was over £14,700 million. Various
measures have recently been taken to provide
new opportunities for the industry and the
518
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
consumer. These include relaxation on
membership conditions of casinos (of which
there are around 120 in Great Britain), and
broadcast advertising of commercial bingo.
National Lottery Awards
Sport is one of five good causes to receive
awards from funds raised by the National
Lottery. By June 1997 awards of £630 million
had been made to some 3,200 projects in
Britain. Projects have ranged from the
provision of small items of equipment and
floodlight facilities at grass roots level to the
building of major sports venues. Around 50
sports have benefited from Lottery funding.
The largest single award from the National
Lottery Sports Fund has been for nearly £20
million for the swimming complex in
Manchester (see p. 514). Changes to the
Lottery distribution regulations now mean
that some £50 million a year is being used for
programmes as well as building projects. The
Government’s White Paper on the Lottery
(see p. 47) outlines further changes in the ways
in which the Sports Councils are able to
encourage applications and plan strategically
for the deployment of Lottery funds.
Some of the funds from the Millennium
Commission (see p. 47) are also for sporting
and recreational developments. Major
schemes include:
• £46 million for the Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff, which will be ready for the
1999 Rugby World Cup (see p. 527);
• £42.5 million for a new national cycle
network; and
• £23 million for the development of the
national football stadium in Scotland at
Hampden Park (Glasgow).
SPORT ON TELEVISION AND RADIO
Major sporting events receive extensive
television and radio coverage and are watched or
heard by millions of viewers or listeners. Sports
receiving the most coverage on terrestrial
television are football, horse racing, snooker and
cricket. Euro 96 attracted a peak viewing figure
of 26 million, spread over two channels.
Since 1988 the amount of sport on
television has grown considerably, to over
12,000 hours a year, primarily as a result of the
development of satellite and cable
broadcasting including channels devoted
exclusively to sport. Some major events, such
as certain football, rugby union and cricket
matches, are now shown live only on these
channels. As a result, there has been
considerable discussion about public
accessibility to sport on television, including
the pay-per-view service, whereby subscribers
pay an additional amount to watch particular
events—BSkyB introduced pay-per-view in
1996, mainly for top boxing contests.
Certain important sporting events—‘listed’
events—are not permitted to be shown on
television solely on pay-per-view or
subscription terms unless they have first been
offered to terrestrial channels:
• the FIFA World Cup football finals;
• the FA Cup Final;
• the Scottish FA Cup Final;
• the finals weekend of the Wimbledon
Tennis Championships;
• the Olympic Games;
• the Grand National;
• the Derby; and
• Test cricket matches involving England.
The Government has set up an urgent
review of the listed events. Its aim is to ensure
that major sporting events are available to the
greatest number of potential viewers and
listeners.
A TO Z OF POPULAR SPORTS
Some of the major sports in Britain, many of
which were invented by the British, are
described below.
Angling
Angling is one of the most popular
countryside sports. There are an estimated 3
million anglers in Britain. Many fish for
salmon and trout, particularly in the rivers and
lochs of Scotland and in Wales. In England
and Wales the most widely practised form of
519
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
angling is for coarse fish (freshwater fish other
than salmon or trout). Separate organisations
represent game, coarse and sea fishing clubs in
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, and there are separate competitions in
each of the three angling disciplines. A
number of options for a national centre for
angling are under discussion by the governing
bodies; the ESC has indicated that it will
consider a bid for Lottery funding and also
provide technical advice and assistance.
In 1996 Alan Scotthorne won the world
freshwater fishing championships, while Chris
Clark won the world shore championships and
England took the team title in the latter event.
Athletics
A recent development in athletics has been a
significant growth in mass participation
events, notably marathons and half
marathons. The largest is the London
Marathon, which takes place every spring.
About 29,000 runners took part in the 1997
event. Many of the runners are sponsored,
raising considerable amounts for charities and
other good causes.
British athletes held world records in two
events in October 1997: Jonathan Edwards in
the triple jump, achieved in 1995 when he
became the first man to jump beyond 18
metres; and Colin Jackson in the 110 metre
hurdles (achieved in 1991). British athletes
won six medals in the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, with silver medals for Jonathan
Edwards and for Roger Black (400 metres),
Steve Backley (javelin) and the men’s 4 x 400
metres relay team (Jamie Baulch, Roger
Black, Mark Richardson and Iwan Thomas);
and bronze medals for Denise Lewis
(heptathlon) and Steve Smith (high jump).
Paula Radcliffe finished second in the 1997
world cross-country championships in Turin.
At the world athletics championships in
Athens in August 1997, British athletes won
five silver medals—Steve Backley, Jonathan
Edwards, Colin Jackson, Denise Lewis and
the men’s 4 x 400 metres relay team (with the
same line-up as the Olympics)—with a
bronze medal for the men’s 4 x 100 metres
relay team of Darren Braithwaite, Darren
Campbell, Julian Golding and Doug Walker.
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the
Badminton Association of England and the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Ulster Branch)
Badminton Unions. Around 5 million people
play badminton in Britain and there are over
5,000 clubs. The Badminton Association of
England has a modern coach education
system to develop coaches for players of all
levels.
The world championships were held in
Glasgow in May-June 1997. The All England
Badminton Championships, held at the
National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, is a
leading tournament in the world grand prix
circuit.
A mini version of the game—Short
Badminton—and badminton for the disabled
have been introduced in recent years.
Basketball
In Britain over 3 million people participate in
basketball. The English Basketball
Association is the governing body in England,
with similar associations in Wales, Scotland
and Ireland (Ulster Branch). All the
associations are represented on the British
and Irish Basketball Federation, which acts as
the co-ordinating body for Britain and the
Irish Republic.
The leading clubs play in the National
Basketball Leagues, which cover four
divisions for men and two for women, while
there are also leagues for younger players.
Mini-basketball has been developed for
players under the age of 13. Wheelchair
basketball is played under the same rules,
with a few basic adaptations, and on the same
court as the running game.
The English Basketball Association runs
various development schemes for young
people which aim to increase participation
and improve the quality of basketball
throughout England. There is also a scheme
to provide 10,000 outdoor basketball goals in
parks and play areas in England to encourage
recreational participation in the sport.
520
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn (flat
green and crown green) and indoor bowls.
About 4,000 lawn bowling clubs are affiliated
to the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish
Bowling Associations, which, together with
Women’s Bowling Associations for the four
countries, play to the rules of the World Bowls
Board. Crown green bowls and indoor bowls
have their own separate associations.
British bowlers have achieved considerable
success in international championships. At the
world outdoor championships (held every four
years) the winners at the most recent event,
held in Adelaide in 1996, included Tony
Allcock, who became the first man to defend
the singles title successfully, and Scotland,
winners of the overall team title. At the 1997
world indoor championships, held in Preston,
Hugh Duff won his second world title in the
singles, while Tony Allcock and Mervyn King
won the pairs title. Norma Shaw was the
winner of the 1997 women’s world indoor
singles championship, held at Llanelli.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the
rules established by the 9th Marquess of
Queensberry in 1865. In Britain boxing is both
amateur and professional, and in both strict
medical regulations are observed.
All amateur boxing in England is controlled
by the Amateur Boxing Association of
England. There are separate associations in
Scotland and Wales, and boxing in Northern
Ireland is controlled by the Irish Amateur
Boxing Association. The associations organise
amateur boxing championships as well as
training courses for referees, coaches and
others. Headguards must be used in all British
amateur competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the
British Boxing Board of Control. The Board
appoints inspectors, medical officers and
representatives to ensure that regulations are
observed and to guard against overmatching
and exploitation.
Britain currently has seven world
champions: Naseem Hamed, who holds the
World Boxing Organisation (WBO)
featherweight title; heavyweights Lennox
Lewis (who holds the World Boxing
Council—WBC—version) and Herbie Hide
(WBO); super-middleweights Robin Reid
(WBC) and Joe Calzaghe (WBO); Robbie
Regan (WBO bantamweight); and Carl
Thompson (WBO cruiserweight).
Chess
There are local chess clubs and leagues
throughout Britain, and chess is also played
widely in schools and other educational
establishments. Domestic competitions
include the British Championships, the
National Club Championships and the County
Championships. The Hastings Chess
Congress, which started in 1895, is the world’s
longest running annual international chess
tournament.
The governing bodies are the British Chess
Federation (responsible for England and for
co-ordinating activity among the home
nations), the Scottish Chess Association and
the Welsh and Ulster Chess Unions.
England won the European Team
Championship for the first time in May 1997.
Earlier in the year Luke McShane, at 13,
became the world’s youngest international
master.
Cricket
The earliest extant set of laws for cricket,
which was first played in south-east England,
are dated 1744. The rules of the game became
the responsibility, in the 18th century, of the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which still
frames the laws today. The MCC is based at
Lord’s cricket ground in north London, the
administrative centre of the English game.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages.
Throughout Britain there is a network of
cricket consisting of first-class, minor counties
and club games with a variety of leagues.
The main competition in professional
cricket is the Britannic Assurance County
Championship, played by 18 first-class county
teams in four-day matches. There are
521
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
currently three one-day competitions: the
Benson & Hedges Cup, the NatWest Trophy
and the AXA Life League.
A major change in the administration of
cricket took effect in January 1997 when the
England and Wales Cricket Board was
established, succeeding a number of bodies,
including the Test and County Cricket
Board. In August 1997 the new Board
produced a strategic plan for the future of
cricket. Following discussions, a number of
changes to the main cricket competitions
have been decided, including a new
knockout cup in 1999 replacing the Benson
& Hedges Cup and which will involve the
top eight counties in the County
Championship in 1998; and a new National
League, with two divisions, which will
succeed the AXA Life League in 1999.
Every year there is a series of five-day
Cornhill Insurance Test matches played
between England and one or more touring
teams from Australia, India, New Zealand,
Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West
Indies or Zimbabwe. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these
countries in the British winter. England will
host the 1999 World Cup.
The governing body of cricket for women
and girls is the Women’s Cricket Association.
Women’s cricket is played at local, county and
international level.
Cycling
Cycling, one of Britain’s fastest growing activities,
includes road and track racing, time-trialling,
cyclo-cross (cross country racing), touring and
bicycle moto-cross (BMX). All-terrain or
mountain bikes are increasingly popular.
The British Cycling Federation has 16,000
members and is the internationally recognised
governing body for British cycling as a sport.
The Road Time Trials Council (to which 1,019
cycling clubs are affiliated) controls road time
trials. The CTC (Cyclists’ Touring Club), with
65,000 members and affiliates, is the governing
body for recreational and urban cycling, and
holds the CTC rally each year in York. CTC
Scotland represents cyclists in Scotland, Wales
has its own Cyclists’ Union and Northern
Ireland also has separate federations for
competitive cycling.
In 1996 Chris Boardman won the 4,000
metres pursuit title at the World Cycling
Championships at the Manchester Velodrome,
in a new world record of 4 minutes 11 seconds.
He later regained the world record for the
distance covered in 1 hour, when at the
Velodrome he rode for over 56 km. At the
Atlanta Olympics he had won a bronze in the
time trial, while Max Sciandri also won a
bronze, in the road race.
Equestrianism
The arts of riding and driving are promoted
by the British Horse Society, which is
concerned with the welfare of horses, road
safety, riding rights of way and training. It
runs the British Equestrian Centre at
Stoneleigh in Warwickshire. With some
63,000 members, the Society is the parent
body of the Riding Club movement, which
holds rallies, meetings and competitions
culminating in annual national championships.
Leading horse trials, comprising dressage,
cross-country and show jumping, are held at a
number of locations. The Badminton Horse
Trials is one of Britain’s largest sporting events,
attracting around 250,000 spectators.
Show jumping is regulated and promoted by
the British Showjumping Association. The
major events include the Horse of the Year
Show at Wembley in London and the
Hickstead Derby at Hickstead (West Sussex).
John Whitaker has won the Volvo World Cup
twice, in 1990 and 1991, and was runner-up in
May 1997, riding Virtual Village Welham.
The authority responsible for equestrian
competitions (other than racing) at
international and Olympic level is the British
Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates the
activities of the British Horse Society and the
British Showjumping Association.
Football
Association football is controlled by separate
football associations in England, Wales,

SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Football has seen an influx of money
during the 1990s, particularly into the top
clubs. This has arisen primarily as a result
of the agreements on television coverage,
notably with BSkyB, while several leading
clubs, such as Manchester United, are
listed on the London Stock Exchange.
More leading international footballers—
from most European countries and from
South America, Africa, Australia and
elsewhere—are now playing in the top
divisions as clubs have been able to finance
their purchase. Transfer fees have also
risen—a then world record fee was set in
1996 when Alan Shearer was signed by
Newcastle United from Blackburn Rovers
for £15 million.
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
340 clubs are affiliated to the Football
Association and more than 42,000 clubs to
regional or district associations. The FA,
founded in 1863, and the Football League,
founded in 1888, were both the first of their
kind in the world. In Scotland there are 78
full and associate clubs and nearly 6,000
registered clubs under the jurisdiction of the
Scottish Football Association.
A new FA Premier League was started in
England in 1992 and now comprises 20 clubs.
A further 72 full-time professional clubs play
in three main divisions run by the Football
League. During the season, which lasts from
August until May, over 2,000 English League
matches are played. In June 1997 a £40
million scheme to establish new centres of
excellence for coaching and developing
young players was announced, with a
contribution of £20 million from the FA
Premier League being matched by £20
million from the English Sports Council’s
Lottery Fund.
Three Welsh clubs play in the Football
League, while the National League of Wales
contains 20 semi-professional clubs. In
Scotland the Scottish Football League has 40
clubs, equally divided into four divisions. In
Northern Ireland, 16 semi-professional clubs
play in the Irish Football League.
The major annual knock-out competitions
are the FA Cup sponsored by Littlewoods and
the Coca-Cola Cup (the League Cup) in
England, the Tennents Scottish Cup, the
Coca-Cola Cup (the Scottish League Cup),
the Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup.
Euro 96, the final stage of the European
Championship, was held in June 1996. This
was the biggest football tournament to have
been held in Britain since the 1966 World
Cup. About 1.2 million spectators watched
Euro 96 and the event was televised in 195
countries. Following the success of the event,
the FA announced its intention of putting in a
bid to host the World Cup in 2006. England
and Scotland have both qualified for the 1998
World Cup finals in France.
Gaelic Games
Gaelic Games, increasingly popular in
Northern Ireland, cover the sports of Gaelic
football, handball, hurling, camogie (women’s
hurling) and rounders. There are over 700
clubs in Northern Ireland affiliated to the
Gaelic Athletic Association and the Camogie
Council, the official governing bodies
responsible for Gaelic Games.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland and is ruled by the
Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R & A), which
is situated at St Andrews on the east coast of
Scotland. The Golfing Union of Ireland and
parallel unions in Wales, Scotland and
England are the national governing bodies for
men’s amateur golf. These bodies are affiliated
to the R & A and are represented on the
Council of National Golf Unions, which is the
British co-ordinating body responsible for
handicapping and organising home
international matches. Women’s amateur golf
in Great Britain is governed by the Ladies’
Golf Union. Club professional golf is
governed by the Professional Golfers’
Association (PGA) and tournament golf by the
European PGA Tour and the Women
Professional Golfers European Tour.
Women’s golf in Northern Ireland is governed
by the Irish Ladies Golf Union.
The main tournament of the British golfing
year is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s four ‘major’ events. Other important
523
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
events include the World Matchplay
Championship at Wentworth; the Walker Cup
and Curtis Cup matches for amateurs, played
between Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States; and the Ryder Cup and
Solheim Cup matches for men and women
professionals respectively, played every two
years between Europe and the United States.
Europe retained the Ryder Cup in September
1997, winning in Valderrama (Spain) by 14.5
to 13.5 points.
There are nearly 2,000 golf courses in
Britain. Some of the most famous include St
Andrews, Royal Lytham and St Anne’s,
Muirfield and Troon (which staged the 1997
British Open Championship).
Nick Faldo won the US Masters tournament
at Augusta in 1996, his third win in the event
and his sixth ‘major’ title. Colin Montgomerie
headed the European list of money winners in
1997 for the fifth year running and finished
second in the 1997 US Open. In the women’s
game Alison Nicholas won the US Women’s
Open in July 1997 and Laura Davies is ranked
number three in the world.
Greyhound Racing
Greyhound racing is one of Britain’s most
popular spectator sports, with about 5 million
spectators a year. Meetings are usually held
three times a week at each track, with at least
ten races a meeting. The main event of the
year is the Greyhound Derby, run in June at
Wimbledon Stadium, London. Tracks are
licensed by local authorities. There are 32
major tracks and around 45 smaller tracks,
although the number of tracks has fallen
recently.
The rules for the sport are drawn up by the
National Greyhound Racing Club, the sport’s
judicial and administrative body. The
representative body is the British Greyhound
Racing Board.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into five main
disciplines: artistic (or Olympic) gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics,
general gymnastics and sports aerobics.
The governing body for the sport is British
Gymnastics. Over the past decade the number
of affiliated clubs has nearly doubled. The sport
is particularly popular with schoolchildren and
young adults. It is estimated that between 3 and
4 million schoolchildren take part in some form
of gymnastics every day.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games cover a wide range
of athletic competitions, including running,
cycling, dancing and solo piping. The
heavyweight events are the most popular and
include throwing the hammer, tossing the
caber and putting the shot. Over 70 gatherings
of various kinds take place throughout
Scotland, the most famous being the annual
Braemar Gathering.
The Scottish Games Association is the
official governing body responsible for athletic
sports and games at Highland and Border
events in Scotland.
Hockey
The modern game of hockey was started by
the Hockey Association (of England), which
was founded in 1886. The Irish Ladies
Hockey Union was the first women’s
governing body and assisted in the formation
of the controlling body of women’s hockey in
England, the All England Women’s Hockey
Association. A single association—the
England Hockey Association—was formed in
June 1997 to govern all hockey in England;
there are similar single associations in
Scotland and Wales. Cup competitions and
leagues exist at national, divisional or district,
club and school levels, both indoors (six-a-
side) and outdoors, and there are regular
international matches and tournaments. A
National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes,
opened in 1996, is now the venue for all major
hockey matches in England.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing and
National Hunt (steeplechasing and hurdle)
racing. The turf flat race season runs from late
524
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
March to early November, but all-weather flat
racing and National Hunt racing take place
throughout the year. Britain has 59
racecourses and about 12,000 horses currently
in training.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the 2,000 Guineas and
the 1,000 Guineas, both run at Newmarket;
the Oaks (Epsom); and the St Leger
(Doncaster). The most important National
Hunt meeting is the National Hunt Festival
held at Cheltenham in March, which features
the Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, is the world’s best-known
steeplechase and dates from 1839.
British-trained racehorses have won
several important events overseas in recent
years. Singspiel, trained by Michael
Stoute, won the Canadian International
and the Japan Cup in 1996, and the Dubai
World Cup in 1997.
The British Horseracing Board is the
governing authority for racing in Britain. Its
responsibilities include the fixture list, race
programmes, relations with the Government
and the betting industry, and central
marketing. The Jockey Club, as the regulatory
authority, is responsible for licensing,
discipline and security.
Ice Skating
Ice skating has four main disciplines: ice figure
(single and pairs), ice dance, speed skating and
precision skating. The governing body is the
National Ice Skating Association of UK Ltd.
There are 68 rinks in Britain, with plans in
hand for a number of new rinks. A £16 million
project for a new ice arena in Sheffield will
receive funding from the National Lottery
Sports Fund.
British couples have won the world ice
dance championship 17 times, the most recent
being Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean,
who won four consecutive world
championships between 1981 and 1984. They
returned to amateur competition briefly in
1994, winning a gold medal at the European
Championships and a bronze medal at the
Winter Olympics.
Judo
Judo is popular not only as a competitive sport
and self-defence technique, but also as a
means of general fitness training. An
internationally recognised grading system is in
operation through the sport’s governing body,
the British Judo Association. In October 1997
Kate Howey won the world middleweight
title. The world championships in 1999 will be
staged in Birmingham.
Keep Fit
Keep fit encompasses various forms of
movement and exercise activities. The Keep Fit
Association (KFA), one of the largest governing
bodies in England, has 1,500 teachers and a
membership of 12,000. It promotes fitness
through movement, exercise and dance for
people of all ages and abilities. Its national
certificated training scheme is recognised by
local education authorities throughout Britain.
Autonomous associations serve Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. The Exercise Association
of England is a health-promoting organisation
concerned with raising professional standards
and advising the public.
Martial Arts
A broad range of martial arts, mainly derived
from the Far East, is practised in Britain.
There are recognised governing bodies for
karate, ju-jitsu, aikido, Chinese martial arts,
kendo, taekwondo and tang soo do. The most
popular martial art is karate, with over 100,000
participants.
Motor-car Sports
The main four-wheeled motor sports include
motor racing, autocross, rallycross, rallying
and karting. In motor racing the Grand Prix
Formula 1 World Championship is the major
form of the sport.
525
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The governing body for four-wheeled
motor sport in Britain is the RAC (Royal
Automobile Club) Motor Sports Association.
The Association issues licences for a variety of
competitions. It also organises the RAC Rally,
an event in the World Rally Championship,
and the British Grand Prix, which is held at
Silverstone as part of the Formula 1 World
Championship.
Britain has had more Formula 1 world
champions than any other country. The most
recent is Damon Hill (son of Graham Hill, a
previous world champion), who won the 1996
Formula 1 World Championship and has won
21 Grand Prix.
British car constructors, including Williams
and McLaren, have enjoyed outstanding
success in Grand Prix racing and many other
forms of racing. Most of the cars in Formula 1
have been designed, developed and built in
Britain. A new team to enter Formula 1 in
1997 is the Stewart Grand Prix team (headed
by a previous world champion, Jackie Stewart,
and his son Paul). The motor sport industry in
Britain is estimated to generate an annual
turnover of £1,300 million (of which exports
account for 60 per cent) and to employ more
than 50,000 people.
In 1995 Colin McRae became the first
British driver to win the World Rally
Championship.
Motor-cycle Sports
Motor-cycle sports include road racing, moto-
cross, grass track, speedway, trials, drag
racing, enduro (endurance off-road racing)
and sprint. There are between 40,000 and
50,000 competitive motor, cyclists in Britain.
The governing bodies of the sport are the
Auto-Cycle Union in England and Wales, the
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and the Motor
Cycle Union of Ireland (in Northern Ireland).
The major events of the year include the Isle
of Man TT races and the British Road Race
Grand Prix. The Auto-Cycle Union also
provides off-road training by approved
instructors for riders of all ages.
Carl Fogarty won the World Superbike
Championships in 1994 and 1995, and in 1997
finished runner-up, winning six races. In 1996
Darren Dixon and Alex Hetherington won
their second successive world sidecar title.
Joey Dunlop has a record 22 wins in the Isle of
Man TT races.
Mountaineering
The representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council (BMC), which works
closely with the Mountaineering Councils of
Scotland and Ireland. The main areas of work
include access and conservation. A survey has
estimated that climbing is one of the fastest
growing sports in Britain. The BMC estimates
that the number of active participants is
around 150,000, while there are many more
hill walkers. There are over 300
mountaineering and climbing clubs in Britain,
and three National Centres for
mountaineering activities run by the Sports
Councils (see p. 515). Organisations such as
the Scottish Mountain Safety Group help to
promote the safe enjoyment of the hills.
British mountaineers have played a leading
role in exploring the world’s great mountain
ranges. The best-known is Sir Chris
Bonington, who has climbed Everest and led
many other expeditions, including an
expedition in 1997 to the unclimbed Sepu
Kangri in Tibet. Some of the world’s hardest
rock climbs are found on cliffs in Britain.
Netball
More than 60,000 adults play netball regularly
in England and a further 1 million young
people play in schools. The sport is played
almost exclusively by women and girls.
The All England Netball Association is the
governing body in England, with Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland having their own
separate organisations. National competitions
are staged annually for all age groups. The
world championships are held every four
years—in 1995 they were staged at the
National Indoor Arena in Birmingham.
Rowing
Rowing is taught in many schools, universities
and rowing clubs throughout Britain. The
main types of boats are single, pairs and
double sculls, fours and eights. The governing
526
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
body in England is the Amateur Rowing
Association; similar bodies regulate the sport in
Scotland, Wales and Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge, has
been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession. At
the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire crews from
all over the world compete each July in various
kinds of race over a straight course of 1 mile
550 yards (about 2.1 km).
Steven Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent won
the gold medal in the coxless pairs in both the
1992 and 1996 Olympics. Steven Redgrave has
now won four successive Olympic gold
medals, a feat achieved by only a very few
people in Olympic history. They have now
joined up with one of the team who won a
bronze medal in 1996 in the coxless fours—
Tim Foster—and with James Cracknell to
form a new coxless four with the long-term
aim of competing in the Olympic Games in
Sydney in 2000. They won one of two gold
medals for Britain at the world championships
in Aiguebelette (France) in September 1997,
with the women’s coxless four also winning
gold. Britain won a record eight medals, with
two silver medals—in the women’s double
sculls and the men’s lightweight eight—and
four bronze medals.
Rugby League
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby
union (see below) of 22 clubs in the north of
England, where the sport is still concentrated.
The governing body of the professional game
is the Rugby Football League, while the amateur
game is governed by the British Amateur Rugby
League Association. The major domestic club
match of the season is the Challenge Cup Final,
played at Wembley Stadium in London. Rugby
league’s centenary world cup took place in
England and Wales in 1995, when England were
runners-up to Australia.
Rugby league was transformed in 1996 with
the creation of a Super League. This consists
of 12 clubs: ten from the north of England,
one from London and one representing Paris.
There are two other divisions, with 11 and 12
clubs respectively. A new World Club
Championship, involving the Super League
teams and teams from Australia and New
Zealand, began in June 1997, and the final was
held in Australia in October 1997.
Rugby Union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game) is
thought to have originated at Rugby School in
the first half of the 19th century. The sport is
played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (RFU) in England and parallel
bodies in Wales, Scotland and Ireland (Ulster
Branch). Each of the four countries has
separate national league and knock-out
competitions for its domestic clubs.
An annual Five Nations Championship is
contested by England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland
and France. Overseas tours are undertaken by
the national sides and by the British Lions, a
team representing Great Britain and Ireland.
Tours are made to Britain by teams
representing the major rugby-playing nations.
The Rugby World Cup is held every four
years. Wales has been selected by the
International Rugby Board to host the finals of
the 1999 World Cup. The Cardiff Arms Park
Stadium is being substantially rebuilt in time
for this event, with a significant financial
contribution from the Millennium
Commission (see p. 47). Other matches in the
competition will be shared among England,
Scotland, Ireland and France.
Rugby union is going through a period of
change following the decision in 1995 to end
its amateur status and as a result of the
renegotiation of television contracts for
international matches at much higher levels
than before. Players may now be paid and, as
with football (see p. 523), new money has been
attracted into several of the top clubs.
Skiing
Skiing takes place in Scotland from December
to May and also at several English locations
when there is sufficient snow. The five
established winter sports areas in Scotland are
Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee, the Lecht and
527
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Nevis Range. All have a full range of ski-lifts,
prepared ski runs and professional instructors.
There are over 115 artificial or dry ski-slopes
throughout Britain, and 1.5 million people take
part in the sport. The British Ski and
Snowboard Federation is the representative
body for international competitive skiing and
snowboarding. The home country ski councils
are responsible for the development of the sport
in their appropriate country, mainly through
coaching, race training and arranging
competitions.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker was invented by the British in India
in 1875 and is played by approximately 7
million people in Britain. British players have
an outstanding record in the game and have
dominated the major professional
championships. The main tournament is the
annual Embassy World Professional
Championship, held in Sheffield. The
outstanding player of the 1990s is Stephen
Hendry, who has won the world title six times
(including five years in a row up to 1996) and
was runner-up in 1997.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game in England is the English
Association for Snooker and Billiards.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
separate associations. The World Professional
Billiards and Snooker Association organises all
world-ranking professional events and holds
the copyright for the rules. The representative
body for women is the World Ladies’ Billiards
and Snooker Association.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets,
which was invented at Harrow School in the
1850s. The governing body for squash in
England is the Squash Rackets Association;
there are separate governing bodies in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. The British
Open Championships is one of the major
world events in the sport.
The number of players in Britain is
estimated at over 2 million, of whom more
than 500,000 compete regularly in inter-club
league competitions. There are nearly 9,000
squash courts in England, provided mainly by
squash clubs, commercial organisations and
local authorities.
In 1997 England retained the world team
championships when the team beat Canada in
the final in Kuala Lumpur. The England team
consisted of Del Harris, Peter Marshall,
Simon Parke and Chris Walker.
Swimming
Swimming is a popular sport and form of
exercise for people from all age groups.
Competitive swimming is governed by the
Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) in
England and by similar associations in
Scotland and Wales. Together these three
associations form the Amateur Swimming
Federation of Great Britain, which co¬
ordinates the selection of Great Britain teams
and organises international competitions.
Northern Ireland forms part of the Irish
Amateur Swimming Association. Instruction
and coaching are provided by qualified
teachers and coaches who hold certificates
awarded mainly by the ASA.
In the 1996 Olympics Paul Palmer won a
silver medal in the 400 metres freestyle and
Graeme Smith a bronze medal in the 1,500
metres freestyle. James Hickman won the 200
metres butterfly at the World Short Course
Championships in Gothenburg in April 1997.
Table Tennis
Table tennis was developed in Britain in the
second half of the 19th century. It is popular
with all sections of the community, and is
played in a variety of venues and among all age
groups. The sport is also a major recreational
and competitive activity for people with
disabilities. The governing body in England is
the English Table Tennis Association, while
there are separate associations in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
The 1997 World Table Tennis
Championships were held in Manchester.
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1873 and the first championships
528
SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
governing body for tennis in Great Britain is
the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), to which
the Welsh and Scottish LTAs are affiliated.
Tennis in Northern Ireland is governed by
Tennis Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The Wimbledon Championships, held
within the grounds of the All England Club,
are one of the four tennis ‘Grand Slam’
tournaments. Prize money totalled £6.9
million in 1997. An extensive redevelopment
of the All England Club is in progress and the
new No 1 Court was used for the 1997
Championships. In 1997 the Championships
generated £31 million for British tennis.
In September 1997 Greg Rusedski was
runner-up in the US Open, and by October he
was ranked fourth in the world, the highest
rating by a British player since the start of open
tennis in 1968, while Tim Henman was also in
the world’s top 20. In the 1996 Olympics Neil
Broad and Tim Henman were runners-up in
the men’s doubles. David Sherwood and James
Trotman won the junior boys’ doubles title at
the 1997 Australian Open.
Players can take part in national and county
championships. National competitions are
organised for schools, and short tennis has
been introduced for children aged five and
over. The game is played in over 3,000 schools
and in leisure centres. About 5 million people
play tennis in Britain.
The LTA has a five-year plan for
developing tennis in Great Britain in the
period to 2001. It is working in partnership
with county tennis associations, clubs, schools,
further and higher education institutions, and
local authorities. The aim is to expand
participation, encourage regular competition
and produce more world-class tennis players.
Volleyball
The English Volleyball Association and
parallel associations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland act as the sport’s governing
bodies. The Association organises national,
regional and area championships for a variety
of ages. Mini-Volley is a three-a-side version
of the game adapted for children under 13.
Grass and beach volleyball tournaments are
proving very popular with children and are
leading to an increase in the number of schools
playing volleyball.
Yachting
Yachting comprises sailing, powerboating and
windsurfing on both inland and offshore
waters. Racing in sailing boats takes place
between one-design classes or under handicap,
which provides level racing for boats of
different size and shape. Among well-known
ocean races are the Round The World Yacht
Race and the Fastnet Race.
The Royal Yachting Association is the
governing body for all yachting in Britain.
About 3 million people participate in the
sport.
At the 1996 Olympics silver medals were
won by Ben Ainslie in the Laser class and by
John Merricks and Ian Walker in the 470
(double-handed dinghy) class. Shirley
Robertson is ranked as the world number one
in the Europe class.

Obituaries
Diana, Princess of Wales
Born 1 July 1961, the youngest daughter of the 8th
Earl Spencer and the Hon. Mrs Shand-Kydd.
Married the Prince of Wales on 29 July 1981, the
first Englishwoman to marry an heir to the throne
for over 300 years. Died 31 August 1997, after a car
crash in Paris. Her two sons, Prince William, born
1982, and Prince Harry, born 1984, are respectively
second and third in line of succession to the throne.
During her marriage, she was patron or president
of over 100 organisations, but after her divorce in
July 1996, she reduced her charity work to six areas:
young homeless people; leprosy sufferers;
HIV/AIDS; English National Ballet; cancer
sufferers; and sick children. During the last year of
her life she gave her support to the British Red
Cross Anti-Personnel Land Mines Campaign. To
mark her humanitarian work, The Diana, Princess
of Wales Memorial Fund has been set up to
channel donations to the causes she championed
during her lifetime.

BRITAIN 1998
an official handbook
Britain 1998 is the 49th in a series of annual Official Handbooks,
now produced by the Office for National Statistics. Over the years it
has established itself as one of the best-known and most respected
reference works on Britain. It is the only one that gathers together in
a single volume a complete range of official information about the
structure and organisation of the UK, and the government policies
that underpin ‘how Britain works’.
The 1998 edition has been thoroughly updated, and includes tables,
maps, diagrams and photographs, as well as the usual comprehensive
text on every major aspect of British society. Special features in this
edition include:
• an introductory essay celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
National Health Service, by Alan Langlands, Chief Executive of the
NHS in England;
• an 8-page colour section on the Government Art Collection,
which celebrates its 100th anniversary in 1998;
• new maps showing the revised local authority boundaries in
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales; and
• a 4-page photographic section
remembering the work of Diana,
Princess ofWales.
