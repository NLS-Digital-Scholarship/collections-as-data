# collections-as-data
Data analysis of NLS [collections as data](https://cerlblog.wordpress.com/2020/08/13/special-collections-as-data-the-national-library-of-scotlands-data-foundry/), including collections of metadata and digitised text.

To explore these collections in live Jupyter Notebooks, [open them here in Binder](https://gesis.mybinder.org/binder/v2/gh/NLS-Digital-Scholarship/collections-as-data/28337836da8b9d3a2131393fd914cd91e1e9fba6) (please note this may take several minutes to load).
